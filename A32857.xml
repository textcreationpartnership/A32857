            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Preſent with all humility, to Your moſt Sacred hands, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that Cauſe which is and ought to be infinitely dearer to you, than all the World: Not doubting but upon this Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I ſhall be cenſured for a double boldneſs; both for undertaking ſo great a Work, ſo far beyond my weak abilities; and again, for preſenting it to ſuch a Patron, whoſe judgement I ought to fear more than any Adverſary. But for the firſt, it is a ſatisfaction to my ſelf, and may be to others, that I was not drawn to it out of any vain opinion of myſelf, (whoſe perſonal defects are the only thing which I preſume to know,) but undertook it in obedience in Him who ſaid, <hi>Tu converſus confirma fratres,</hi> not to St. <hi>Peter</hi> only, but to all men: being encouraged alſo to it by the goodneſs of the Cauſe, which is able to make
<pb facs="tcp:64345:3"/>a weak man ſtrong. To the belief hereof I was not led partially or by chance, as many are, by the prejudice and prepoſſeſſion of their Country, Education, and ſuch like inducements; which if they lead to Truth in one place, perhaps lead to Error in a hundred; but having with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt equality and indifferency, made enquiry and grounds on both Sides, I was willing to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to others, that ſatisfaction which was given to my ſelf. For my inſcribing to it Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Sacred Name, I ſhould labour much in my excuſe of it from high preſumption, had it not ſome appearance of Title to your Majeſties Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage and protection, as being a Defence of that Book, which by ſpecial order from Your Majeſty was written ſome years ſince, chiefly for the general good, but peradventure not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome aime at the recovery of One of Your meaneſt Subjects from dangerous deviation; and ſo due unto Your Majeſty, as the fruit of Your own High Humility and moſt Royal Charity. Beſides, it is in a manner nothing elſe, but a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of, and a ſuperſtruction upon that bleſſed Doctrine, wherewith I have adorned and armed the Frontiſpice of my Book, which was ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly recommended to Your Royal Father of happy memory, to all the lovers of Truth and Peace; that is, to all that were like Himſelf, as the only hopeful means of healing the Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſtendome, whereof the Enemy of ſouls makes ſuch peſtilent advantage. The luſtre of this bleſſed Doctrine I have endeavoured
<pb facs="tcp:64345:3"/>to uncloud and unvail, and to free it from thoſe miſts and fumes which have been raiſed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure it, by one of that Order, which envenomes even poiſon it ſelf, and makes the <hi>Roman</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on much more malignant and turbulent than otherwiſe it would be: whoſe very Rule and Doctrine, obliges them to make all men, as much as lies in them, ſubjects unto Kings, and ſervants unto Chriſt, no farther than it ſhall pleaſe the Pope. So that whether Your Majeſty be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, either as a Pious Son towards Your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Father King <hi>James,</hi> or as a tender hearted and compaſſionate Son towards Your diſtreſſed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Catholique Church, or as a King of Your Subjects, or as a Servant unto Chriſt, this Work, (to which I can give no other commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, but that it was intended to do You ſervice in all theſe capacities,) may pretend, not unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, to Your Gracious acceptance. Laſtly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Defence of that whole Church and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion You profeſs, it could not be ſo proper to any Patron as to the great Defendor of it; which ſtyle Your Majeſty hath ever ſo exactly made good, both in ſecuring it from all dangers, and in vindicating it (by the well ordering and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying this Church) from all the foul aſperſions both of Domeſtick and Foraign enemies, of which they can have no ground, but their own want of Judgement, or want of Charity. But it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a deſpairing and loſt cauſe to ſupport it ſelf with theſe impetuous out-cries and clamours, the faint refuges of thoſe that want better argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb facs="tcp:64345:4"/>like that Stoick in <hi>Lucian</hi> that cryed <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>O damned villain!</hi> when he could ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. Neither is it credible the wiſer ſort of them ſhould believe this their own horrid aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That a God of goodneſs ſhould damn to eternal torments, thoſe that love him and love truth, for errors which they fall into through hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty! But this they muſt ſay, otherwiſe their only great argument from their damning us, and our not being ſo peremtory in damning them, becauſe we hope unaffected Ignorance may excuſe them, would be loſt: and therefore they are engaged to act on this Tragical part, only to fright the ſimple and ignorant, as we do little children, by telling them that bites, which we would not have them meddle with. And truely that herein they do but act a part, and know themſelves to do ſo, and deal with us here, as they do with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> whom they accurſe and Excommunicate for faſhion ſake on <hi>Maundy-Thurſday,</hi> for detaining part of St. <hi>Peters</hi> Patrimony, and abſolve him without ſatisfaction on <hi>Good-Friday;</hi> methinks their faltring and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy herein, makes it very apparent: For though for the moſt part, they ſpeak nothing but thunder and lightning to us, and damn us all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy or exception; yet ſometimes to ſerve other purpoſes, they can be content to ſpeak to us in a milder ſtrain, and tell us, as my Adverſary does more than once, <hi>That they allow Proteſtants as much Charity as Proteſtants allow them.</hi> Neither is this the only contradiction which I have diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:64345:4"/>in this uncharitable Work; but have ſhewed that by forgetting himſelf, and retracting moſt of the principal grounds he builds upon, he hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me the labour of a Confutation: which yet I have not in any place found any ſuch labour or difficulty, but that it was undertakable by a man of very mean, that is, of my abilities. And the reaſon is, becauſe it is Truth I plead for; which is ſo ſtrong an argument for it ſelf, that it needs only light to diſcover it; whereas it concernes Falſhood and Error to uſe diſguiſes and ſhadowings, and all the fetches of Art and Sophiſtry; and therefore it ſtands in need of abler men, to give that a colour at leaſt, which hath no real body to ſubſiſt by. If my endeavours in this kind may contribute any thing to this diſcovery, and the making plain that Truth (which my Charity perſwades me the moſt part of them diſaffect, only becauſe it hath not been well repreſented to them,) I have the fruit of my labour, and my wiſh, who deſire to live to no other end, than to do ſervice to Gods Church, and Your moſt Sacred Majeſty, in the quality of</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">U</seg>Pon the firſt news of the publication of your Book, I uſed all diligence, with ſpeed to procure it; and came with ſuch a mind to the reading of it, as <hi>S. Auſtin,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was a ſetled Catholique, brought to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with <hi>Fauſtus</hi> the Manichee. For, as he thought that if any thing more than ordinary might be ſaid in defence of the Manichean Doctrine, <hi>Fauſtus</hi> was the man from whom it was to be expected: So my perſwaſion concerning you was,—<hi>Si Pergama dextrâ Defendi poſſunt, certè hac defenſa videbo.</hi> For I conceived that among the Champions of the Roman Church, the Engliſh in reaſon muſt be the beſt, or equall to the beſt, as being by moſt expert Maſters trained up purpoſely for this war, and perpetually practiſed in it. Among the Engliſh, I ſaw the Jeſuites would yield the firſt place to none; and men ſo wiſe in their generation as the Jeſuits were, if they had any <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles</hi> among them, I preſumed, would make choice of him for this ſervice. And beſides, I had good aſſurance, that in the framing of this building, though you were the only Architect, yet you wanted not the aſſiſtance of many diligent hands to bring you in choiſe materials towards it; nor of many careful and watchful eyes, to correct the errors of your Work, if any ſhould chance to eſcape you. Great reaſon therefore had I to expect great matters from you, and that your Book ſhould have in it the Spirit and Elixir of all that can be ſaid in defence of your Church and Doctrine; and to aſſure my ſelf, that if my reſolution not to believe it, were not built upon the rock of evident grounds and reaſons, but only upon ſome ſandy and deceitful appearances, now the wind and ſtorm and floods were coming, which would undoubtedly overthrow it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither truly were you more willing to effect ſuch an alteration in me, then I was to have it effected. For my deſire is to go the right way to <hi>eternal happineſs.</hi> But whether this way lie on the right hand or the left, or ſtraight forwards; whether it be by following a living Guide, or by ſeeking my direction in a Book, or by hearkning to the ſecret whiſper of ſome private Spirit, to me it is indifferent. And he that is otherwiſe affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and hath not a travellers indifference, which <hi>Epictetus</hi> requires in all that would find the truth, but much deſires in reſpect of his eaſe, or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or profit, or advancement, or ſatisfaction of friends, or any humane
<pb facs="tcp:64345:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>conſideration, that one way ſhould be true rather than another; it is odds but he will take his deſire that it ſhould be ſo, for an aſſurance that it is ſo. But, I for my part, unleſs I deceive my ſelf, was, and ſtill am ſo affected, as I have made profeſſion, not willing I confeſs to take any thing upon truſt, and to believe it without asking my ſelf why; no, nor able to command my ſelf (were I never ſo willing) to follow, like a ſheep, every Shepherd that ſhould take upon him to guide me; or every flock that ſhould chance to go before me: but moſt apt and moſt willing to be led by reaſon to any way, or from it; and alwaies ſubmitting all other reaſons to this one, God hath ſaid ſo, therefore it is true. Nor yet was I ſo unreaſonable as to expect Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical demonſtrations from you in matters plainly incapable of them, ſuch as are to be believed, and, if we ſpeak properly, cannot be known; ſuch therefore I expected not. For, as he is an unreaſonable Maſter, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a ſtronger aſſent to his concluſions then his arguments deſerve; ſo I conceive him a froward and undiſciplin'd Scholar, who deſires ſtronger arguments for a concluſion than the Matter will bear. But, had you repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to my underſtanding ſuch reaſons of your Doctrine, as, being weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an eaven ballance, held by an eaven hand, with thoſe on the other ſide, would have turned the ſcale, and have made your Religion more credible than the contrary; certainly, I ſhould have deſpiſed the ſhame of one more alteration, and with both mine arms and all my heart moſt readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have embraced it. Such was my expectation from you, and ſuch my preparation, which I brought with me to the reading of your Book.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Would you know now what the event was, what effect was wrought in me, by the peruſal and conſideration of it? To deal truly and ingenuouſly with you, I fell ſomewhat in my good opinion both of your ſufficiency and ſincerity: but was exceedingly confirmed in my ill opinion of the Cauſe maintained by you. I found every where ſnares that might entrap, and colours that might deceive the ſimple; but nothing that might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, and very little that might move an underſtanding man, and one that can diſcern between Diſcourſe and Sophiſtry. In ſhort, I was verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that I plainly ſaw and could make it appear, to all diſ-paſſionate and unprejudicate Judges, that a vein of ſophiſtry and calumny did run clean thorow it from the beginning to the end. And letting ſome Friends underſtand ſo much, I ſuffered my ſelf to be perſwaded by them, that it would not be either unproper for me, nor unacceptable to God, nor perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture altogether unſerviceable to his Church, nor juſtly offenſive to you (if you indeed were a lover of Truth, and not a maintainer of a Faction,) if ſetting aſide the Second Part, which was in a manner wholly employed in particular diſputes, repetitions and references, and in wranglings with D. <hi>Potter</hi> about the ſenſe of ſome ſupernumerary quotations, and whereon the main queſtion no way depends, I would make a fair and ingenuous anſwer to the Firſt, wherein the ſubſtance of the preſent Controverſie is confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly contained; and which, if it were clearly anſwered, no man would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire any other anſwer to the Second. This therefore I undertook with a full reſolution to be an adverſary to your Errors, but a Friend and Servant to your Perſon: and ſo much the more a friend to your perſon, by how much the ſeverer and more rigid adverſary I was to your errors.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In this Work my conſcience bears me witneſs that I have, according to your advice, <hi>proceeded always with this conſideration, that I am to give a
<pb facs="tcp:64345:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>moſt ſtrict account of every line, and word, that paſſeth under my pen:</hi> and therefore have been preciſely careful for the matter of my Book to defend truth only, and only by Truth. And then, ſcrupulouſly fearful of ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing you or any man with <hi>the manner</hi> of handling it. From this Rule, ſure I am, I have not willingly ſwerved in either part of it; and, that I might not do it ignorantly, I have not only my ſelf examined mine own Work, (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with more ſeverity than I have done yours, as conceiving it a baſe and unchriſtian thing to go about to ſatisfie others with what I my ſelf am not fully ſatisfied;) but have alſo made it paſs the fiery tryal of the exact cenſures of many underſtanding Judges, alwayes heartily wiſhing that you your Self had been of the <hi>Quorum.</hi> But they who did undergo this burthen, as they wanted not ſufficiency to diſcover any heterodox Doctrine, ſo I am ſure, they have been very careful to let nothing ſlip diſſonant from truth or from the authorized Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and therefore whatſoever cauſeleſs or groundleſs jealouſie, any man may entertain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my Perſon, yet my Book, I preſume, in reaſon and common equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould be free from them; wherein I hope, that little or nothing hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped ſo many eyes, which being weighed in the balance of the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, will be found too light. And in this hope I am much confirmed, by your ſtrange carriage of your ſelf in this whole buſineſs. For though by ſome crooked and ſiniſter arts, you have got my Anſwer into your hands, now a year ſince and upwards, as I have been aſſured by ſome that profeſs to know it, and thoſe of your own party; though you could not want every day fair opportunities of ſending to me, and acquainting me with any Exceptions, which, you conceived, might be juſtly taken to it, or any part of it (than which nothing could have been more welcome to me) yet hitherto you have not been pleaſed to acquaint me with any one. Nay more, though you have been at ſundry times, and by ſeveral wayes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated and ſollicited, nay preſſed and importuned by me, to joyn with me in a private diſcuſſion of the Controverſie between us, before the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Anſwer, (becauſe I was extremely unwilling to publiſh any thing which had not paſſed all manner of tryals, as deſiring not that I, or my Side, but that Truth might overcome on which Side ſoever it was;) though I have proteſted to you, and ſent it under my hand, (which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation by Gods help I would have made good) If you, or any other would undertake your Cauſe, would give me a fair meeting, and chooſe out of your whole Book any one argument, whereof you were moſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and by which you would be content the reſt ſhould be judged of, and make it appear that I had not, or could not anſwer it, that I would deſiſt from the work which I had undertaken, and anſwer none at all; though by all the Arts which poſſibly I could deviſe, I have provoked you to ſuch a trial, in particular by aſſuring you that if you refuſed it, the World ſhould be informed of your tergiverſation: notwithſtanding all this, you have perpetually, and obſtinately declined it; which to my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a very evident ſign that there is not any truth in your Cauſe, nor (which is impoſſible there ſhould be) ſtrength in your Arguments, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering what our Saviour hath told us, <hi>Every one that doth evill hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; but he that doth truth, cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifeſt that they are wrought in God.</hi>

In the mean while though you deſpaired of compaſſing your deſire this honeſt way; yet you have not omitted to tempt me, by baſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy conſiderations, to deſert the Cauſe which I had undertaken; letting me underſtand from you, by an Acquaintance common to us both, how that <hi>in caſe my Work ſhould come to light, my inconſtancy in Religion</hi> (ſo you miſcal my conſtancy in following that way to heaven which for the preſent ſeems to me the moſt probable) <hi>ſhould be to my great ſhame pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the life;</hi> that <hi>my own Writings ſhould be produced againſt my ſelf; that I ſhould be urged to anſwer my own Motives againſt Proteſtantiſm, and that ſuch things ſhould be publiſhed to the World touching my belief,</hi> (for my Painter I muſt expect ſhould have great skill in Perſpective) <hi>of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity, the Deity of our Saviour, and all ſupernaturall Verities, as ſhould endanger all my Benefices preſent or future:</hi> that <hi>this warning was given me, not out of fear of what I could ſay (for that Catholiques if they might wiſh any ill would beg the Publication of my Book, for reſpects obvious enough,) but out of a meer charitable deſire of my good and reputation:</hi> and <hi>that all this was ſaid upon a ſuppoſition that I was anſwering, or had a mind to anſwer</hi> Charity Maintain'd; <hi>If not, no harm was done.</hi> To which cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Premonition, as I remember, I deſired the Gentleman, who dealt between us, to return this Anſwer, or to this effect; That I believed the Doctrine of the Trinity, the Deity of our Saviour, and all other ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Verities revealed in Scripture, as truly and as heartily as your ſelf, or any man, and therefore herein your <hi>Charity</hi> was very much <hi>miſtaken;</hi> but much more and more uncharitably in conceiving me a man that was to be wrought upon with theſe <hi>Terribiles viſuformae,</hi> thoſe carnal and baſe fears which you preſented to me, which were very proper motives for the Devil and his inſtruments to tempt poor-ſpirited men out of the way of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and honeſty, but very incongruous, either for Teachers of Truth to make uſe of, or for Lovers of Truth (in which Company I had been long ago matriculated) to hearken to, with any regard. But if you were indeed deſirous that I ſhould not anſwer <hi>Charity Maintain'd,</hi> one way there was, and but one, whereby you might obtain your deſire; and that was, by letting me know, when and where I might attend you, and by a fair con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, to be written down on both ſides, convincing mine underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (who was reſolved not to be a <hi>Recuſant</hi> if I were <hi>convicted,</hi>) that any one part of it, any one Argument in it, which was of moment and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and whereon the cauſe depends, was indeed unanſwerable. This was the effect of my Anſwer, which I am well aſſured was delivered: but Reply from you I received none but this, That you would have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with me but in Print; and ſoon after finding me of proof againſt all theſe batteries, and thereby (I fear) very much enraged, you took up the reſolution of the furious Goddeſs in the Poet, madded with the unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfulneſs of her malice,</p>

9. Your calumnies againſt Proteſtants in generall, are ſet down in theſe words, Chap. 2. §. 2. <hi>The very doctrine of Proteſtants if it be followed cloſely, and with coherence to it ſelf, muſt of neceſſity induce</hi> Socinianiſm. <hi>This I ſay confidently, and evidently prove, by inſtancing in one error which may well be tearmed the Capital, and mother-Hereſie, from which all other muſt follow at eaſe; I mean, their hereſie in affirming, That the perpetual vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church of Chriſt, deſcended by a never interrupted ſucceſſion from our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, to this day, is not infallible in all that it propoſeth to be believed, as revealed truths. For if the</hi> infallibility <hi>of ſuch a publique</hi> Authority <hi>be once impeached; what remains, but that every man is given over to his own</hi> wit, <hi>and</hi> diſcourſe? <hi>And talk not here of Holy Scripture. For if the true Church may erre, in defining what Scriptures be Canonicall; or in delivering the ſenſe and meaning thereof; we are ſtill devolved, either upon the</hi> private ſpirit, (<hi>a foolery now exploded out of</hi> England, <hi>which finally leaving every man to his own conceits, ends in</hi> Socinianiſm); <hi>or elſe upon natural wit, and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for examining and determining, What Scriptures contain true or falſe doctrine, and in that reſpect, ought to be received, or rejected. And indeed, take away the authority of God's Church, no man can be aſſured, that any one Book, or parcel of Scripture, was written by divine inſpiration: or that all the contents, are infallibly true; which are the direct errors of</hi> Socinians. <hi>If it were but for this reaſon alone, no man, who regards the eternal ſalvation of his ſoul, would live or dye in</hi> Proteſtancy, <hi>from which ſo vaſt abſurdities as theſe of the</hi> Socinians <hi>muſt inevitably follow. And it ought to be an unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able comfort to all us Catholiques, while we conſider, that none can deny the infallible authority of our Church, but joyntly he muſt be left to his own wit and wayes; and muſt abandon all</hi> infuſed faith, <hi>and true Religion, if he do but underſtand himſelf aright.</hi> In all which diſcourſe, the only true word you ſpeak is, <hi>This I ſay confidently.</hi> As for <hi>proving evidently,</hi> that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you reſerved for ſome other opportunity: for the preſent, I am ſure you have been very ſparing of it.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. You ſay, indeed confidently enough, that <hi>The deny all of the Churches infallibility is the Mother-Hereſie, from which all other muſt follow at eaſe:</hi> Which is ſo far from being a neceſſary truth, as you make it, that it is indeed a manifeſt falſhood. Neither is it poſſible for the wit of man, by any good, or ſo much as probable conſequence, from the denyal of the Churches Infallibility to deduce any one of the ancient Hereſies, or any one error of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> which are the Hereſies here entreated of. For who would not laugh at him that ſhould argue thus; Neither the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor any other Church is infallible, <hi>Ergo,</hi> The doctrine of <hi>Arrius, Pelagius, Eutyches, Neſtorius, Photinus, Manichaeus,</hi> was true Doctrine? On the other ſide, it may be truly ſaid and juſtified by very good and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual reaſon, that he that affirms, with you, the Pope's infallibility, puts himſelf into his hands and power, to be led by him at his eaſe and pleaſure into all Hereſie, and even to Hell it ſelf; and cannot with reaſon ſay (ſo long as he is conſtant to his grounds) <hi>Domine, cur ita facis?</hi> but muſt believe <hi>white to be black, and black to be white; vertue to be vice, and vice to be vertue;</hi> nay (which is a horrible but a moſt certain truth) Chriſt to be Antichriſt, and Antichriſt to be Chriſt, if it be poſſible for the Pope to ſay ſo: Which, I ſay, and will maintain, howſoever you daub and diſguiſe it, is indeed to make men Apoſtate from Chriſt to his pretended
<pb facs="tcp:64345:9"/>Vicar, but real Enemy. For that name and no better (if we may ſpeak truth without offence) I preſume He deſerves, who under pretence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting the Law of Chriſt, (which Authority without any word of expreſs warrant he hath taken upon himſelf,) doth in many parts evacuate and diſſolve it: So dethroning Chriſt from his dominion over mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and inſtead of Chriſt, ſetting up Himſelf; Inaſmuch as he that requires that his interpretations of any Law ſhould be obeyed as true and genuine, ſeem they to mens underſtandings never ſo diſſonant and diſcordant from it, (as the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> does,) requires indeed that <hi>his interpretations</hi> ſhould. be the <hi>Lawes;</hi> and he that is firmly prepared in minde to believe and receive all ſuch interpretations without judging of them, and though to his private judgement they ſeem unreaſonable, is indeed congruouſly diſpoſed to hold Adultery a venial ſin, and Fornication no ſin, whenſoever the Pope and his Adherents ſhall ſo declare. And whatſoever he may plead, yet either wittingly or ignorantly, he makes the Law and the Law-maker both ſtales, and obeyes only the Interpreter. As if I ſhould pretend that I ſhould ſubmit to the Lawes of the King of <hi>England,</hi> but ſhould indeed reſolve to obey them in that ſenſe which the King of <hi>France</hi> ſhould put upon them, whatſoever it were; I preſume every underſtanding man would ſay, that I did indeed obey the King of <hi>France,</hi> and not the King of <hi>England.</hi> If I ſhould pretend to believe the Bible, but that I would underſtand it according to the ſenſe which the chief Mufty ſhould put upon it, Who would not ſay that I were a Chriſtian in pretenſe only, but indeed a <hi>Mahumetan?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. Nor will it be to purpoſe for you to pretend that the Precepts of Chriſt are ſo plain that it cannot be feared, that any Pope ſhould ever go about to diſſolve them, and pretend to be a Chriſtian: For, not to ſay that you now pretend the contrary, (to wit,) <hi>that the law of Chriſt is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure even in things neceſſary to be believed and done,</hi> and by ſaying ſo, have made a fair way for any fowl interpretation of any part of it: certainly that which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath already done in this kind, is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent argument, that (if ſhe once had this power unqueſtioned, and made expedite and ready for uſe, by being contracted to the Pope) ſhe may do what ſhe pleaſeth with it. Who that had lived in the Primitive Church, would not have thought it as utterly improbable, that ever they ſhould have brought in the worſhip of Images, and picturing of God as now it is, that they ſhould legitimate Fornication? Why may we not think, they may in time take away the whole Communion from the Laity, as well as they have taken away half of it? Why may we not think that any Text and any Senſe may not be accorded, as well as the whole 14. <hi>Ch.</hi> of the <hi>Ep.</hi> of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> is reconciled to the Latine-Service? How is it poſſible any thing ſhould be plainer forbidden, than the <hi>worſhip of Angels,</hi> in the <hi>Ep.</hi> to the <hi>Coloſsians?</hi> than <hi>the teaching for Doctrines mens commands</hi> in the Goſpel of S. <hi>Mark?</hi> And therefore ſeeing we ſee theſe things done, which hardly any man would have believed, that had not ſeen them, Why ſhould we not fear that this unlimited power may not be uſed hereafter with as little moderation? Seeing devices have been invented how men may worſhip Images without Idolatry, and kill innocent men under pretence of Hereſie without murder; Who knows that ſome tricks may not be hereafter deviſed, by which, Lying with other
<pb facs="tcp:64345:10"/>mens wives ſhall be no Adultery, taking away other mens goods no theft? I conclude therefore, That if <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf were here, and were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the difference, Which is more likely to be mother of all Hereſie, The <hi>denial</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> or the <hi>affirming</hi> of the <hi>Popes Infallibility,</hi> that he would certainly ſay, <hi>This is the mother, give her the childe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. You ſay again confidently, That <hi>if this Infallibility be once impeached, every man is given over to his own wit and diſcourſe:</hi> which, if you mean <hi>diſcourſe,</hi> not guiding it ſelf by Scripture, but only by principles of nature, or perhaps by prejudices and popular errors, and drawing conſequences, not by Rule, but Chance, is by no means true; if you mean by Diſcourſe, right Reaſon, grounded on Divine Revelation and common Notions, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by God in the hearts of all men; and deducing, according to the never failing rules of Logick, conſequent deductions from them: If this be it which you mean by <hi>diſcourſe,</hi> it is very meet, and reaſonable, and neceſſary that men, as in all their actions, ſo eſpecially in that of greateſt importance, the choice of their way to happineſs, ſhould be left unto it: and he that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows this in all his opinions and actions, and does not only ſeem to do ſo, follows alwayes God; whereas he that followeth a Company of men, may oft-times follow a company of beaſts. And in ſaying this, I ſay no more than S. <hi>John</hi> to all Chriſtians in theſe words, <hi>Dearly beloved, believe not every ſpirit; but try the ſpirits, whether they be of God, or no:</hi> and the rule he gives them to make this tryal by, is, to conſider, Whether they <hi>confeſs Jeſus to be Chriſt;</hi> that is, the Guid of their Faith, and Lord of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; not, whether they acknowledge the Pope to be his Vicar: I ſay no more than S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in exhorting all Chriſtians, <hi>To try all things, and hold faſt that which is good:</hi> then S. <hi>Peter</hi> in commanding all Chriſtians, <hi>To be ready to give a reaſon of the hope that is in them:</hi> then <hi>our Saviour</hi> himſelf, in forewarning all his Followers, that <hi>if they blindly followed blinde guides, both leaders and followers ſhould fall into the ditch:</hi> and again, in ſaying even to the people, <hi>Yea, and why of your ſelves judge yee not what is right?</hi> And though by paſſion, or precipitation, or prejudice, by want of reaſon or not uſing what they have, men may be, and are oftentimes, led in error and miſchief; yet, that they cannot be miſguided by <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> truly ſo called, ſuch as I have deſcribed, you your ſelf have given them ſecurity. For, what is <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> but drawing concluſions out of premiſes by good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? Now, the Principles which we have ſetled, to wit, the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> are on all ſides agreed to be infallibly true. And you have told us in the fourth Chap. of this Pamphlet, That <hi>from truth no man can, by good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, infer falſhood;</hi> Therefore, by <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> no man can poſſibly be led to Error: but if he err in his Concluſions, he muſt of neceſſity, either err in his Principles, (which here cannot have place) or commit ſome error in his Diſcourſe; that is, indeed, not Diſcourſe, but ſeem to do ſo.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. You ſay, Thirdly, with ſufficient confidence, That <hi>if the true Church may erre in defining what Scriptures be Canonical, or in delivering the ſenſe thereof, then we muſt follow either the private Spirit, or elſe natural wit and judgment; and by them examine what Scriptures contain true or falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and in that reſpect ought to be received or rejected.</hi> All which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently untrue, neither can any proof of it be pretended. For though the preſent Church may poſſibly err in her judgment touching this matter, yet have we other directions in it, beſides the private ſpirit, and the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:64345:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the contents, (which latter way may conclude the negative very ſtrongly, to wit, that ſuch or ſuch a Book cannot come from God, becauſe it contains irreconcileable Contradictions; but the Affirmative it cannot conclude, becauſe the contents of a Book may be all true, and yet the Book not written by Divine inſpiration:) other direction therefore I ſay we have, beſides either of theſe three, and that is, The teſtimony of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. You ſay, Fourthly, with convenient boldneſs, That <hi>this infallible Authority of your Church being denyed, no man can be aſſured, that any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Scripture was written by Divine inſpiration:</hi> Which is an untruth, for which no proof is pretended; and beſides, void of modeſty, and full of impiety. The firſt, becauſe the experience of innumerable Chriſtians is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, who are ſufficiently aſſured, that the Scripture is divinely inſpired, and yet deny the infallible authority of your Church, or any other. The ſecond, becauſe if I have not ground to be aſſured of the Divine authority of Scripture, unleſs I firſt believe your Church infallible, than I can have no ground at all to believe it: becauſe there is no ground, nor can any be pretended, why I ſhould believe your Church <hi>infallible,</hi> unleſs I firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scripture Divine.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Fiftly and laſtly, You ſay, with confidence in abundance, that <hi>none can deny the infallible authority of your Church, but he muſt abandon all infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed faith and true religion, if he do but underſtand himſelf:</hi> Which is to ſay, agreeable to what you had ſaid before, and what out of the abundance of your heart you ſpeak very often, <hi>That all Chriſtians beſides you, are open Fools, or concealed Atheiſts.</hi> All this you ſay with notable confidence (as the maner of Sophiſters is, to place their confidence of prevailing in their confident maner of ſpeaking,) but then for the <hi>evidence</hi> you promiſed to maintain this confidence, that is quite vaniſhed and become inviſible.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Had I a minde to recriminate now, and to charge Papiſts (as you do Proteſtants) that they lead men to Socinianiſm, I could certainly make a much fairer ſhew of evidence than you have done. For I would not tell you, You deny the infallibility of the Church of <hi>England; ergo,</hi> you lead to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianiſm, which yet is altogether as good an Argument as this; Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants deny the infallibility of the <hi>Roman</hi>-Church; <hi>ergo,</hi> they induce Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm: Nor would I reſume my former Argument, and urge you, that by holding the Popes infallibility, you ſubmit your ſelf to that Capital and Mother-Hereſie, by advantage whereof, he may lead you at eaſe to believe <hi>vertue vice,</hi> and <hi>vice vertue;</hi> to believe Antichriſtianity Chriſtianiſm, and Chriſtianity Antichriſtian; he may lead you to Socinianiſm, to Turciſm, nay to be Devill himſelf if he have a minde to it: But I would ſhew you that divers wayes the Doctors of your Church do the principal and proper work of the Socinians for them, undermining the Doctrine of the Trinity, by denying it to be ſupported by thoſe pillars of the Faith, which alone are fit and able to ſupport it, I mean Scripture, and the Conſent of the ancient Doctors.</p>

For the Dominicans maintain on the one Side, that <hi>God can foreſee nothing but what he decrees:</hi> The Jeſuits on the other Side, that <hi>he doth not decree all things:</hi> And from hence the Socinians conclude (as it is obvious for them to do) that <hi>he doth not foreſee all things.</hi> Laſtly, I might adjoyn this, that you agree with one conſent, and ſettle for a rule unqueſtionable, that no part of Religion can be repugnant to reaſon, whereunto you in particulr ſubſcribe unawares in ſaying, <hi>From truth no man can by good conſequence inferr Falſhood,</hi> which is to ſay in effect, that Reaſon can never lead any man to Error: And after you have done ſo, you proclaim to all the world (as you in this Pamphlet do very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,) that <hi>if men follow their Reaſon and diſcourſe,</hi> they will (if they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand themſelves) be lead to Socinianiſm. And thus you ſee with what probable matter I might furniſh out and juſtifie my accuſation, if I ſhould charge you with leading men to Socinianiſm! Yet I do not conceive that I have ground enough for this odious imputation. And much leſs ſhould you have charged Proteſtants with it, whom you confeſs to abhorre and deteſt it: and who fight againſt it, not with the broken reeds, and out
<pb facs="tcp:64345:11"/>of the paper-fortreſſes of an imaginary Infallibility, which were only to make ſport for their Adverſaries; but with the <hi>ſword of the Spirit, the Word of God:</hi> Of which we may ſay moſt truly, what <hi>David</hi> ſaid of <hi>Goliah</hi>'s Sword, offered by <hi>Abimelech, Non eſt ſicut iſte, There is none comparable to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. Thus Proteſtants in general, I hope, are ſufficiently vindicated from your calumny. I proceed now to do the ſame ſervice for the Divines of <hi>England;</hi> whom you queſtion firſt in point of learning and ſufficiency, and then in point of conſcience and honeſty, as prevaricating in the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which they profeſs, and inclining to Popery. Their Learning (you ſay) conſiſts only in <hi>ſome ſuperficial talent of preaching, languages, and elocuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not in any deep knowledge of Philoſophy, eſpecially of Metaphyſicks, and much leſs of that moſt ſolid, profitable, ſubtile, and</hi> (O rem ridiculam, <hi>Cato,</hi> &amp; jocoſam!) <hi>ſuccinct method of School-Divinity.</hi> Wherein you have diſcovered in your ſelf the true Genius and ſpirit of detraction. For taking advantage from that wherein Envy it ſelf cannot deny but they are very eminent, and which requires great ſufficiency of ſubſtantial learning, you diſparage them as inſufficient in all things elſe. As if forſooth, becauſe they diſpute not eternally, <hi>Utrum Chimaera bombinans in vacuo, poſsit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edere ſecundas intentiones? Whether a Million of Angels may not ſit upon a Needle's point?</hi> Becauſe they fill not their brains with notions that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing, to the utter extermination of all reaſon and common ſenſe, and ſpend not an Age in weaving and unweaving ſubtile Cobwebs, fitter to catch flyes than Souls; therefore they have no deep knowledge in the Acroamatical part of Learning! But I have too much honoured the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this detraction, to take notice of it.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. The other Part of your accuſation ſtrikes deeper, and is more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable: And that tels us, that, <hi>Proteſtantiſm waxeth weary of it ſelf; that the Profeſſors of it, they eſpecially of greateſt worth learning and authority, love Temper and Moderation; and are at this time more unreſolved where to faſten, than at the infancy of their Church:</hi> That, <hi>Their Churches begin to look with a new face: Their walls to ſpeak a new language: Their Doctrine to be altered in many things for which their Progenitors forſook the then Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church of Chriſt: For example, The Pope not Antichrist: Prayer for the dead:</hi> Limbus Patrum: <hi>Pictures:</hi> That <hi>the Church hath Authority in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining Controverſies of Faith, and to Interpret Scripture; about Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wil, Predeſtination, Univerſal Grace:</hi> That <hi>all our works are not ſins: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of good works: Inherent Juſtice: Faith alone doth not juſtifie: Charity to be preferred before knowledge; Traditions: Commandments poſsible to be kept:</hi> That <hi>their thirty nine Articles are patient, nay ambitious, of ſome ſenſe wherein they may ſeem Catholique:</hi> That to <hi>alledge the neceſsity of wife and children in theſe dayes, is but a weak plea for a married Miniſter to compaſs a Benefice:</hi> That <hi>Calviniſm is at length accounted Hereſie, and little leſs than Treaſon:</hi> That <hi>men in talk and writing uſe willingly the once fearful names of Prieſts and Altars:</hi> That <hi>they are now put in mind, that for expoſition of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture they are by Canon bound to follow the Fathers: which if they do with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, it is eaſie to tell what doom will paſs againſt Proteſtants, ſeeing, by the confeſsion of Proteſtants, the Fathers are on the Papiſts ſide, which the Anſwerer to ſome ſo clearly demonſtrated, that they remained convinced:</hi> In fine, as the Samaritans ſaw in the Diſciples countenances that they meant to go to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:64345:12"/>ſo you pretend it is even legible in the fore-heads of theſe men, that they are even going, nay making haſte, to <hi>Rome.</hi> Which ſcurrilous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel void of all truth, diſcretion and honeſty, what effect it may have wrought, what credit it may have gained with credulous Papiſts, (who dream what they deſire, and believe their own dreams,) or with ill-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, jealous, and weak Proteſtants, I cannot tell: But one thing I dare boldly ſay, that you your ſelf did never believe it.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. For did you indeed conceive, or had any probable hope, that ſuch men as you deſcribe, men of worth, of learning and authority too, were friends and favourers of your Religion, and inclinable to your Party, Can any imagine that you would proclaim it, and bid the world take heed of them? <hi>Sic notus Ulyſſes?</hi> Do we know the Jeſuits no better than ſo? What, are they turned prevaricators againſt their own Faction? Are they likely men to betray and expoſe their own Agents and Inſtruments, and to awaken the eyes of Jealouſie, and to raiſe the clamor of the people againſt them? Certainly, your Zeal to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> teſtified by your <hi>fourth Vow of ſpecial obedience to the Pope,</hi> proper to your Order, and your cunning carriage of all affairs for the greater advantage and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of that See, are clear demonſtrations that, if you had thought <hi>thus,</hi> you would never have ſaid <hi>ſo.</hi> The truth is, they that run to extreams in oppoſition againſt you, they that pull down your infallibility and ſet up their own, they that declaim againſt your tyranny and exerciſe it themſelves over others, are the Adverſaries that give you greateſt advantage, and ſuch as you love to deal with: whereas upon men of temper and moderation, ſuch as will oppoſe nothing becauſe you maintain it, but will draw as neer to you, that they may draw you to them, as the truth will ſuffer them; ſuch as require of Chriſtians to believe only in Chriſt, and will damn no Man nor Doctrine without expreſs and certain warrant from God; upon ſuch as theſe you know not how to faſten: but if you chance to have confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with any ſuch, (which yet as much as poſſibly you can you avoid and decline,) you are very ſpeedily put to ſilence, and ſee the indefenſible weakneſs of your cauſe laid open to all men And this, I verily believe, is the true reaſon that you thus rave and rage againſt them, as foreſeeing your time of prevailing, or even of ſubſiſting, would be ſhort, if other Adverſaries gave you no more advantage than they do.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. In which perſwaſion alſo I am much confirmed by conſideration of the ſillineſs and poorneſs of thoſe Suggeſtions, and partly of the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent vanity and falſhood of them, which you offer in juſtification of this wicked Calumny. For what, if out devotion towards God, out of a deſire that he ſhould be worſhipped as <hi>in Spirit and truth</hi> in the firſt place, ſo alſo <hi>in the beauty of holineſs?</hi> what if out of fear that too much ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and nakedneſs in the publique Service of God, may beget in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſort of men a dull and ſtupid irreverence; and, out of hope that the outward ſtate and glory of it, being well-diſpoſed and wiſely moderated, may ingender, quicken, increaſe and nouriſh, the inward reverence, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and devotion which is due unto God's Soveraign Majeſty and Power? what if out of a perſwaſion and deſire that Papiſts may be won over to us the ſooner, by the removing of this ſcandall out of their way; and out of an holy jealouſie, that the weaker ſort of Proteſtants might be the eaſier ſeduced to them by the magnificence and pomp of their Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice
<pb facs="tcp:64345:12"/>in caſe it were not removed? I ſay, What if out of theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Governours of our Church, more of late than formerly, have ſet themſelves to adorn and beautifie the places <hi>where God's Honour dwels,</hi> and to make them as heaven-like as they can with earthly ornaments? Is this a ſign that they are warping towards Popery? Is this devotion in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> an argument that ſhe is coming over to the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Sir <hi>Edwin Sands,</hi> I preſume, every man will grant, had no inclination that way; yet he, forty years ſince, highly commended this part of devotion in Papiſts, and makes no ſcruple of propoſing it to the imitation of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants: Little thinking that they who would follow his counſel, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to take away this diſparagement of Proteſtants, and this glorying of Papiſts, ſhould have been cenſured for it, as making way and inclining to Popery. His words to this purpoſe are excellent words; and becauſe they ſhew plainly, that what is now practiſed was approved by zealous Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants ſo long ago, I will here ſet them down.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. <hi>This one thing I cannot but highly commend in that ſort and order: They ſpare nothing which either caſt can perform in enriching, or skill in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorning the Temple of God, or to ſet out his Service with the greateſt pompe and magnificence that can be deviſed. And although, for the moſt part, much baſeneſſe and childiſhneſſe is predominant in the Maſters and Contrivers of their Ceremonies, yet this outward ſtate and glory being well diſpoſed, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender, quicken, increaſe, and nouriſh the inward reverence, reſpect, and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is due unto Soveraign Majeſty and Power. And although I am not ignorant that many men well reputed have embraced the thrifty opinion of that Diſciple, who thought all to be waſted that was beſtowed upon Chriſt in that ſort, and that it were much better beſtowed upon him or the poor, (yet with an eye perhaps that themſelves would be his quarter-Almoners) notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I muſt confeſſe, it will never ſink into my heart, that in proportion of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the allowance for furniſhing out of the ſervice of God ſhould be meaſured by the ſcant and ſtrict rule of meer neceſsity, (a proportion ſo low, that nature to other moſt bountiful, in matter of neceſsity hath not failed, no not the moſt ignoble creatures of the world,) and that for our ſelves no meaſure of heaping but the moſt we can get, no rule of expence but to the utmoſt pompe we liſt: Or that God himſelf had ſo enriched the lower parts of the world with ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull varieties of beauty and glory, that they might ſerve only to the pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering of mortall man in his pride; and that in the Service of the high Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Lord and Giver (the outward glory of whoſe higher pallace may appear by the very lamps that we ſee ſo far off burning gloriouſly in it) only the ſimpler, baſer, cheaper, leſſe noble, leſſe beautiful, leſſe glorious things ſhould be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                  <p n="24">24. Again, what if the names of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Altars,</hi> ſo frequent in the ancient Fathers, though not in the now Popiſh ſenſe, be now reſumed and more commonly uſed in <hi>England</hi> than of late times they were: that

                  <p n="25">25. What if Proteſtants be now put in minde, that, for expoſition of Scripture, they are bound by a Canon <hi>to follow the ancient Fathers:</hi> which whoſoever doth with ſincerity, it is utterly impoſſible, he ſhould be a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt?

                  <p n="26">26. As for the points of Doctrine wherein you pretend that theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines begin of late to falter, and to comply with the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> upon a due examination of particulars it will preſently appear, Firſt, that part of them always have been, and now are, held conſtantly one way by them; as, the Authority of the Church in determining Controverſies of faith, though not the infallibility of it: That there is Inherent Juſtice, though ſo imperfect that it cannot juſtifie: That there are Traditions, though none neceſſary: That charity is to be preferred before knowledge: That good Works are not properly meritorious. And laſtly, that Faith alone juſtifies, though that faith juſtifies not which is alone. And ſecondly, for the remainder, that they, every one of them, have been anciently without breach of charity diſputed among Proteſtants: ſuch for example were the Queſtions about the Pope's being the Antichriſt, The lawfulneſs of ſome kind of prayers for the dead; The Eſtate of the Fathers Souls, before Chriſt's Aſcenſion; Freewill, Predeſtination, Univerſal grace: The poſſibility of keeping God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; The uſe of Pictures in the Church: Wherein that there hath been anciently diverſity of opinion amongſt Proteſtants, it is juſtified to my hand by a Witneſs, with you, beyond exception, even your great friend M. <hi>Breerly, whoſe care, exactneſs, and fidelity</hi> (you ſay in your Preface) <hi>is ſo extraordinary great.</hi> Conſult him therefore: Tract. 3. Sect. 7. of his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology:</hi> And in the 9, 10, 11, 14, 24, 26, 27, 37. Subdiviſions of that <hi>Section;</hi> you ſhall ſee as in a mirror, your ſelf proved an egregious Calumniator, for charging Proteſtants with innovation and inclining to Popery, under pretence forſooth, that their Doctrine begins of late to be altered in theſe points. Whereas, M. <hi>Breerly</hi> will inform you, They have been anciently, and even from the beginning of the Reformation, controverted amongſt them, though perhaps the ſtream and current of their Doctors run one way, and only ſome brook or rivulet of them the other.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. And thus my Friends, I ſuppoſe, are clearly vindicated from your ſcandals and calumnies: It remains now that in the laſt place I bring my ſelf fairly off from your foul aſperſions, that ſo my Perſon may not be (as indeed howſoever it ſhould not be) any diſadvantage or diſparagement to the Cauſe, nor any ſcandal to weak Chriſtians.</p>

28. Your injuries then to me (no way deſerved by me, but by differing in opinion from you, (wherein yet you ſurely differ from me as much as I from you,) are eſpecially three. For <hi>firſt,</hi> upon hearſay, and refuſing to give me opportunity of begetting in you a better underſtanding of me, you charge me with a great number of falſe and impious Doctrines, which I will not name in particular, becauſe I will not aſſiſt you ſo far in the ſpreading of my own undeſerved defamation: but whoſoever teaches or holds them, <hi>let him be Anathema!</hi> The ſum of them all caſt up by your ſelf, in your firſt Chapter, is this, <hi>Nothing ought or can be certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, farther than it may be proved by evidence of Natural Reaſon,</hi> (where I conceive, Natural reaſon is oppoſed to ſupernatural Revelation;) and whoſoever holds ſo, <hi>let him be Anathema!</hi> And moreover to clear my ſelf once for all, from all imputations of this nature, which charge me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriouſly with denial of Supernatural Verities, I profeſs ſincerely, that I believe all thoſe Books of Scripture, which the Church of <hi>England</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts Canonical, to be the Infallible word of God: I believe all things evidently contained in them; all things evidently, or even probably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible from them: I acknowledge all that to be Hereſie, which by the Act of Parliament <hi>primo</hi> of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> is declared to be ſo, and only to be ſo: And though in ſuch points which may be held diverſly of divers men <hi>ſalvâ Fidei compage,</hi> I would not take any man's liberty from him, and humbly beſeech all men, that they would not take mine from me: Yet thus much I can ſay (which I hope, will ſatisfie any man of reaſon,) that whatſoever hath been held neceſſary to ſalvation, either by the Catholique Church of all Ages, or by the conſent of Fathers, meaſured by <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Lyrinenſis</hi> his rule, or is held neceſſary, either by the Catholique Church of this Age, or by the conſent of Proteſtants, or even by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that, againſt the Socinians, and all others whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I do verily believe and embrace.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Another great and manifeſt injury you have done me, in charging me to have forſaken your Religion, <hi>becauſe it conduced not to my temporal ends,</hi> and ſuted not with my deſires and deſigns: Which certainly is an horrible crime, and whereof if you could convince me, by juſt and ſtrong Preſumptions, I ſhould then acknowledge my ſelf to deſerve that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which you would fain induce your Credents unto, that I changed not your Religion for any other, but for none at all. But of this great fault my conſcience acquits me, and God, who only knows the hearts of all men, knows that I am innocent! Neither doubt I but all they who know me, and amongſt them many Perſons of place and quality, will ſay, they have reaſon in this matter to be my Compurgators. And for you, though you are very affirmative in your accuſation, yet you neither do, nor can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any proof or preſumption for it, but forgetting your ſelf (as it is God's will oft times that Slanderers ſhould do), have let fall ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, which being well weighed, will make conſidering men apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that you did not believe your ſelf. For how is it poſſible you ſhould believe that I deſerted your Religion for ends, and againſt the light of my conſcience, out of a deſire of preferment; and yet, out of ſcruple of conſcience, ſhould refuſe (which alſo you impute to me,) to ſubſcribe the 39. Articles, that is, refuſe to enter at the only common door, which herein <hi>England</hi> leads to preferment? Again, How incredible is it that
<pb facs="tcp:64345:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>you ſhould believe, that I forſook the profeſſion of your Religion, as not ſuting with my deſires and deſigns, which yet reconciles the enjoying of the pleaſures and profits of ſin here, with the hope of happineſs hereafter, and propoſes as great hope of great temporal advancements to the capable ſervants of it, as any, nay more than any, Religion in the world; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this ſhould chooſe Socinianiſm, a Doctrine, which howſoever erroneous in explicating the Myſteries of Religion, and allowing greater liberty of opinion in ſpeculative matters, than any other Company of Chriſtians doth or they ſhould do; yet certainly which you, I am ſure, will pretend and maintain to explicate the Laws of Chriſt with more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, and leſs indulgence and condeſcendence to the deſires of fleſh and blood than your Doctrine doth! And beſides, ſuch a Doctrine by which no man in his right minde, can hope for any honour or preferment, either in this Church or State, or any other! All which clearly demonſtrates that this foul and falſe aſperſion, which you have caſt upon me, proceeds from no other fountain, but a heart abounding with the gall and bitterneſs of uncharitableneſs, and even blinded with malice towards me; or elſe from a perverſe zeal to your ſuperſtition, which ſecretly ſuggeſts this perſwaſion to you, That for the Catholique cauſe nothing is unlawful, but that you may make uſe of ſuch indirect and crooked Arts, as theſe, to blaſt my reputation, and to poſſeſs mens minds with diſaffection to my Perſon, leſt otherwiſe peradventure they might with ſome indifference hear reaſon from me. God, I hope, which bringeth light out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, will turn your counſels to fooliſhneſs, and give all good men grace to perceive how weak and ruinous that Religion muſt be, which needs ſupportance from ſuch tricks and devices! So I call them, becauſe they deſerve no better name. For what are all theſe Perſonal matters, which hitherto you have ſpoke of, to the buſineſs in hand? If it could be proved that Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was indeed a Jew, or that Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> was an Atheiſt, yet I preſume you would not accept of this for an Anſwer to all their Writings in defence of your Religion. Let then my actions, and intentions, and opinions be what they will, yet I hope, Truth is nevertheleſs Truth, nor Reaſon ever the leſs Reaſon, becauſe I ſpeak it. And therefore the Chriſtian Reader, knowing that his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or damnation depends upon his impartial and ſincere judgement of theſe things, will guard himſelf, I hope, from theſe impoſtures, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not the perſon, but the cauſe and the reaſons of it; not who ſpeaks, but what is ſpoken: Which is all the favour I deſire of him, as knowing that I am deſirous not to perſwade him, unleſs it be truth whereunto I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him.</p>

But, beſides that it is confuted by my whole Book, and made ridiculous by the Approbations premiſed unto it, it is very eaſie for me out of your own mouth and words to prove it a moſt injurious calumny. For what one concluſion is there in the whole fabrick of my Diſcourſe, that is not naturally deducible out of this one Principle, That <hi>all things neceſſary to ſalvation are evidently contained in Scripture?</hi> Or, what one Concluſion almoſt of importance is there in your Book, which is not by this one clearly confutable?</p>

                     </gap>ers of truth of all Sides may be ſaved; becauſe all neceſſary things being ſuppoſed evident concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, with men ſo qualified, there will be no difference: There being no more certain ſign that a Point is not evident, than that honeſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and indifferent men, and ſuch as give themſelves liberty of judgement after a mature conſideration of the matter, differ about it.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. Grant this, and it will appear <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the meanes whereby the revealed Truths of God are conveyed to our underſtanding, and which are to determine all Controverſies in Faith, neceſſary to be determined, may be, for any thing you have ſaid to the contrary, not a Church, but the Scripture; which contradicts the Doctrine of your <hi>Second Chapter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="33">33. Grant this, and the diſtinction of Points Fundamental and not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, will appear very good and pertinent. For thoſe truths will be Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, which are evidently delivered in Scripture, and commanded to be preached to all men; Thoſe not Fundamental, which are obſcure. And nothing will hinder but that the Catholique Church may err in the latter kind of the ſaid Points: becauſe Truths not neceſſary to the Salvation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be neceſſary to the Beeing of a Church; and becauſe it is not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary that God ſhould aſſiſt his Church any farther than to bring her to Salvation; neither will there be any neceſſity at all of any infallible Guide, either to conſign unwritten Traditions, or to declare the obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Faith. Not for the former end, becauſe this Principle being granted true, nothing unwritten can be neceſſary to be conſigned. Nor for the latter, becauſe nothing that is obſcure can be neceſſary to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, or not miſtaken. And ſo the diſcourſe of your whole <hi>Third Chap.</hi> will preſently vaniſh.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. Fourthly, for the Creed's containing the Fundamentals of ſimple belief, though I ſee not how it may be deduced from this Principle, yet the granting of this, plainly renders the whole diſpute touching the Creed unneceſſary. For if all neceſſary things of all ſorts, whether of ſimple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief or practice, be confeſſed to be clearly contained in Scripture, What imports it whether thoſe of one ſort be contained in the Creed?</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Fifthly, let this be granted, and the immediate Corollary in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to your <hi>fifth Chap.</hi> will be and muſt be, That not Proteſtants for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting, but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for impoſing upon the Faith of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Doctrines unwritten and unneceſſary, and for diſturbing the Churche's peace, and dividing Unity for ſuch matters, is in a high degree preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous and Schiſmatical.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. Grant this ſixthly, and it will follow unavoidably that Proteſtants cannot poſſibly be Hereticks, ſeeing they believe all things evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture, which are ſuppoſed to be all that is neceſſary to be believed: and ſo your <hi>Sixth Chapter</hi> is clearly confuted.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. Grant this laſtly, and it will be undoubtedly conſequent, in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of your <hi>Seventh Chapter,</hi> that no man can ſhew more charity to himſelf than by continuing a Proteſtant; ſeeing Proteſtants are ſuppoſed to believe, and therefore may accordingly practiſe, at leaſt by their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb facs="tcp:64345:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>are not hindered from practiſing and performing all things neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. So that the poſition of this one Principle, is the direct overthrow of your whole Book, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>refore I, needed not, nor indeed have I made uſe of any other. Now this Principle, which is not only the corner-ſtone or chief Pillar, but even the baſis, and adequate foundation of my Anſwer; and which while it ſtands firm and unmoveable, cannot but be the ſupporter of my Book, and the certain ruine of Yours, is ſo far from being, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your pretence, deteſted by all Proteſtants, that all Proteſtants what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, as you may ſee in their harmony of Confeſſions, unanimouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and maintain it. And you your ſelf, Chap. 6. §. 30. plainly confeſs as much, in ſaying, <hi>The whole Edifice of the Faith of Proteſtants is ſetled on theſe two Principles: Theſe particular Books are Canonical Scripture: And the ſenſe and meaning of them is plain and evident, at leaſt, in all Points neceſſary to Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="39">39. And thus your Venom againſt me is in a manner ſpent, ſaving only that there remain two little Impertinencies, whereby you would diſable me from being a fit Advocate for the cauſe of Proteſtants. The firſt, becauſe I refuſe to ſubſcribe the Articles of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> The ſecond, becauſe I have ſet down in writing, Motives which ſometime induced me to forſake Proteſtantiſm, and hitherto have not anſwered them.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. By the former of which Objections it ſhould ſeem, that either you conceive the 39. Articles the common Doctrine of all Proteſtants; and if they be, Why have you ſo often upbraided them with their many and great differences? Or elſe, that it is the peculiar defence of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and not the common cauſe of all Proteſtants, which is here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by me: which are certainly very groſs Miſtakes. And yet why he who makes ſcruple of ſubſcribing the truth of one or two Propoſitions, may not yet be fit enough to maintain that thoſe who do ſubſcribe them are in a ſavable condition, I do not underſtand. Now though I hold not the Doctrine of all Proteſtants abſolutely true, (which with reaſon cannot be required of me while they hold Contradictions,) yet I hold it free from all impiety, and from all error deſtructive of Salvation, or in it ſelf dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: And this I think in reaſon may ſufficiently qualifie me, for a main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer of this aſſertion, that <hi>Proteſtancy deſtroys not Salvation.</hi> For the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I am perſwaded, that the conſtant Doctrine of it is ſo pure and Orthodox, that whoſoever believes it, and lives according to it, undoubtedly he ſhall be ſaved; and that there is no Error in it which may neceſſitate or warrant any man to diſturb the peace, or renounce the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of it. This in my opinion is all intended by Subſcription; and thus much if you conceive me not ready to ſubſcribe, your <hi>Charity</hi> I aſſure you is much <hi>Miſtaken.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="41">41. Your other objection againſt me, is yet more impertinent and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous than the former: Unleſs perhaps it be a juſt exception againſt a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, that himſelf was ſometimes in, and recovered himſelf from, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe which he undertakes to cure; or againſt a Guide in a way, that at firſt, before he had experience himſelf, miſtook it, and afterwards found his error and amended it. That noble Writer <hi>Michael de Montaigne,</hi> was ſurely of a far different minde; for he will hardly allow any Phyſitian competent, but only for ſuch diſeaſes as himſelf had paſſed through:
<pb facs="tcp:64345:15"/>And a far greater than <hi>Montaigne,</hi> even he that ſaid, <hi>Tu converſus confirma fratres,</hi> gives us ſufficiently to underſtand that they which have themſelves been in ſuch a ſtate as to need converſion, are not thereby made incapable of, but rather engaged and obliged unto, and qualified for, this charitable function.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. Neither am I guilty of that ſtrange and prepoſterous zeal (as you eſteem it) which you impute to me; for having been ſo long careleſs in removing this ſcandal againſt Proteſtants, and anſwering my own Motives, and yet now ſhewing ſuch fervor in writing againſt others. For neither are they other Motives, but the very ſame for the moſt part with thoſe which abuſed me, againſt which this Book which I now publiſh, is in a maner wholly imployed: And beſides, though you Jeſuits take upon you to have ſuch large and univerſal intelligence of all State-affairs and matters of importance; yet I hope ſuch a contemptible matter, as an Anſwer of mine to a little piece of paper, may very probably have been written and eſcaped your Obſervation. The truth is, I made an Anſwer to them three years ſince and better, which perhaps might have been publiſhed, but for two reaſons: One, becauſe the Motives were never publique, until you made them ſo: The other, becauſe I was loath to proclaim to all the world ſo much weakneſs as I ſhewed, in ſuffering my ſelf to be abuſed by ſuch ſilly Sophiſms; All which proceed upon miſtakes and falſe ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which unadviſedly I took for granted; as when I have ſet down the Motives in order, by ſubſequent Anſwers to them, I ſhall quickly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and ſo make an end.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. The Motives then were theſe.

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Motives; now my Anſwers to them follow briefly and in order.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. To the firſt: God hath neither decreed nor foretold, that his true Doctrine ſhould <hi>de facto</hi> be alwayes viſibly profeſſed, without any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of falſhood.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond: God hath neither decreed not foretold, that there ſhall be always a viſible company of men free from all error in it ſelf damnable. Neither is it always of neceſſity Schiſmatical to ſeparate from the external communion of a Church, though wanting nothing neceſſary. For if this Church ſuppoſed to want nothing neceſſary, require me to profeſs againſt my conſcience, that I believe ſome errour, though never ſo ſmall and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, which I do not believe, and will not allow me her Communion but upon this condition; In this caſe the Church for requiring this condition is Schiſmatical, and not I for ſeparating from the Church.</p>
                  <p>To the third: If any credit may be given to Records far more creditable than theſe, the Doctrine of Proteſtants, that is, the Bible, hath been confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and the Doctrine of Papiſts, which is in many points plainly oppoſite to it, confounded with ſupernatural and divine Miracles, which for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and glory outſhine Popiſh pretended Miracles, as much as the Sun doth an <hi>Ignis fatuus;</hi> thoſe I mean which were wrought by our Saviour Chriſt and his Apoſtles: Now this Book, by the confeſſion of all ſides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by innumerous Miracles, foretels me plainly, that in after-ages great ſigns and wonders ſhall be wrought in confirmation of falſe doctrin, and that I am not to believe any doctrin which ſeems to my underſtanding repugnant to the firſt, though an Angel from Heaven ſhould teach it; which were certainly as great a Miracle as any that was ever wrought in atteſtation of any part of the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But that true doctrine ſhould in all ages have the teſtimony of Miracles, that I am no where taught; So that I have more reaſon to ſuſpect, and be afraid of pretended Miracles, as ſigns of falſe doctrine, than much to regard them as certain Arguments of the Truth. Beſides, ſetting aſide the Bible, and the Tradition of it, there is as good ſtory for Miracles wrought by thoſe who lived and dyed in oppoſition to the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, (as by S. <hi>Cyprian, Colmannus, Columbanus, Aidanus,</hi> and others,) as there is for thoſe that are pretended to be wrought by the members of that Church. Laſtly, it ſeems to me no ſtrange thing that God in his Juſtice ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb facs="tcp:64345:16"/>ſome true Miracles to be wrought to delude them, who have forged ſo many as apparently the Profeſſors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrin have, to abuſe the World.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth: All thoſe were not<note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>See this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by</hi> Bellar. de Script. Eccleſ. in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtrio. <hi>By</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavius Animad. in Epiph. de inſcrip. operis. <hi>By S.</hi> Auſtin Lib. de Haer. Haer. <hi>80.</hi>
                     </note> Heretiques which by <hi>Philaſtrius, Epiphanius,</hi> or S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> were put in the Catalogue of Heretiques.</p>
                  <p>To the fifth: Kings and Nations have been and may be converted by men of contrary Religions.</p>
                  <p>To the ſixth: The Doctrin of Papiſts, is confeſſed by Papiſts contrary to the Fathers in many points.</p>
                  <p>To the ſeventh: The Paſtors of a Church cannot but have authority from it, to Preach againſt the abuſes of it, whether in Doctrin or Practice, if there be any in it: Neither can any Chriſtian want an ordinary commiſſion from God to do a neceſſary work of Charity after a peaceable manner, when there is no body elſe that can or will do it. In extraordinary caſes, extraordinary courſes are not to be diſallowed. If ſome Chriſtian Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould come into a Countrey of Infidels, and had ability to perſwade them to Chriſtianity, Who would ſay, he might not uſe it for want of Commiſſion!</p>
                  <p>To the eighth: <hi>Luther's</hi> conference with the Devil might be, for ought I know, nothing but a melancholy Dream. If it were reall, the Devil might perſwade <hi>Luther</hi> from the Maſſe, hoping by doing ſo to keep him conſtant to it: Or that others would make his diſſwaſion from it an Argument for it, (as we ſee Papiſts do) and be afraid of following <hi>Luther,</hi> as confeſſing himſelf to have been perſwaded by the Devill.</p>
                  <p>To the ninth: <hi>Iliacos intra muros peccatur &amp; extra.</hi> Papiſts are more guilty of this fault than Proteſtants. Even this very Author in this very Pamphlet hath not ſo many leaves as falſifications and calumnies.</p>
                  <p>To the tenth: Let all men believe the Scripture and that only, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to believe it in the true ſenſe, and require no more of others, and they ſhall find this not only a better, but the only means to ſuppreſs Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and reſtore Unity. For he that believes the Scripture ſincerely, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to believe it in the true ſenſe, cannot poſſibly be an Heretique. And if no more than this were required of any man, to make him capable of the Churches Communion, then all men ſo qualified, though they were different in opinion, yet notwithſtanding any ſuch difference, muſt be of neceſſity one in Communion.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Ive me leave (good Reader) to inform thee, by way of Preface, of three Points. The firſt concerns D. <hi>Potters Anſwer,</hi> to <hi>Charity Miſtaken.</hi> The ſecond relates to this <hi>Reply</hi> of mine. And the third contains ſome <hi>Premonitions,</hi> or <hi>Preſcriptions,</hi> in caſe D. <hi>Potter,</hi> or any in his behalf, think fit to Rejoyn.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the firſt point, concerning D. <hi>Potters Anſwer,</hi> I ſay, in general, reſerving particulars to their proper places, that in his whole Book he hath not ſo much as once truly and really fallen upon the point in queſtion, which was, Whether both Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques and Proteſtants can be ſaved in their ſeveral profeſſions? And therefore <hi>Charity Miſtaken</hi> judiciouſly preſſing thoſe particulars, wherein the difficulty doth preciſely conſiſt, proves in general, that there is but one true Church; that all Chriſtians are obliged to hearken to her; that ſhe muſt be ever viſible, and infallible; that to ſeparate ones ſelf from her communion is Schiſm; and to diſſent from her Doctrin is Hereſie, though it be in points never ſo few, or never ſo ſmall in their own nature; and therefore that the diſtinction of points Fundamental, and not Fundamental, is wholly vain, as it is applyed by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants. Theſe (I ſay) and ſome other general grounds, <hi>Charity Miſtaken</hi> handles, and out of them doth clearly evince, that any leaſt difference in faith cannot ſtand with ſalvation on both ſides: and therefore ſince it is apparent, that Catholiques and Proteſtants diſagree in very many points of faith, they both cannot hope to be ſaved without repentance: and conſequently, as we hold, that Proteſtancy unrepented <hi>deſtroyes Salvation;</hi> ſo muſt they alſo believe that we cannot be ſaved, if they judge their own Religion to be true, and ours to be falſe. And whoſoever diſguizeth this truth, is an enemy to ſouls, which he deceives with ungrounded falſe hopes of Salvation, in different Faiths, and Religions. And this <hi>Charity Miſtaken</hi> performed exactly, according to that which appears to have been his deſign, which was not to deſcend to particular diſputes, and D. <hi>Potter</hi> affectedly does, namely, Whether or no the <hi>Roman</hi>-Church be the only true Church of Chriſt; and much leſſe, Whether general Councels be infallible; whether the Pope may erre in his Decrees common to the whole Church; whether he be above a General Council; whether all points of Faith be contained in Scripture; whether Faith be reſolved into the authority of the Church, as into his laſt <hi>formal Object,</hi> and <hi>Motive;</hi> and, leaſt of all, did he diſcourſe of Images, Communion under both kinds, publique ſervice in an unknown Tongue, Seven Sacraments, Sacrifice of the Maſſe, Indulgences, and <hi>Index Expurgatorius:</hi> All which, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other articles, D. <hi>Potter</hi> (as I ſaid) draws by violence into his Book: and he might have brought in Pope <hi>Joan,</hi> or Antichriſt, or the <hi>Jews</hi> who are permitted to live in <hi>Rome,</hi> which are common Themes for men that want better matter, as D. <hi>Potter</hi> was fain to fetch in the aforeſaid Controverſies, that ſo he might dazle the eyes, and diſtract the minde of the Reader, and hinder him from perceiving, that in his whole anſwer he uttereth nothing to the purpoſe and point in queſtion: which, if he had followed cloſely, I dare well ſay, he might have diſpatched his whole Book, in two or three ſheets of paper. But the truth is, he was loath to affirm plainly, that generally both Catholiques and Proteſtants may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: and yet ſeeing it to be moſt evident that Proteſtants cannot pretend to have any true Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Luther,</hi> except the <hi>Roman,</hi> and ſuch as agreed with her, and conſequently, that they cannot hope for Salvation; if they deny it to us: he thought beſt to avoid this difficulty by confuſion of language, and to fill up his Book with Points which make nothing to the purpoſe. Wherein he is leſſe excuſable, becauſe he muſt grant, that thoſe very particulars to which he digreſſeth, are not Fundamental errors, though it ſhould be granted that they be Errors, which indeed are Catholique Verities. For ſince they b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> not Fundamental, not deſtructive of Salvation, what imports it, Whether we hold them or no, for as much as concerns our poſſibility to be ſaved?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In one thing only he will perhaps ſeem to have touched the point in queſtion, to wit, in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of points Fundamental, and not Fundamental: becauſe ſome may think, that a difference in points which are not Fundamental, breaks not the Unity of Faith, and hinders not the hope of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in perſons ſo diſagreeing. And yet, in this very diſtinction, he never ſpeaks to the purpoſe indeed, but only ſayes, That there are ſome points ſo Fundamental, as that all are obliged to know and <hi>believe</hi> them explicitely; but never tels us, whether there be any other points of Faith, which a man may deny or <hi>disbelieve,</hi> though they be ſufficiently preſented to his underſtanding, as truths revealed, or teſtified by Almighty God; which was the only thing in queſtion. For if it be damnable, as certainly it is, to deny or disbelieve any one truth witneſſed by Almighty God, though the thing be not in it ſelf of any great conſequence, or moment; and ſince of two diſagreeing in matters of Faith, one muſt neceſſarily deny ſome ſuch truth; it clearly followes that amongſt men of different Faiths, or Religions, one only can be ſaved, though their difference conſiſt of divers, or but even one point, which is not in his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Fundamental, as I declare at large in divers places of my firſt Part. So that it is clear, D. <hi>Potter</hi> even in this his laſt refuge and diſtinction, never comes to the point in queſtion; to ſay nothing that he himſelf doth quite overthrow it, and plainly contradict his whole deſigne, as I ſhew in the third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of my <hi>firſt Part.</hi>

4. And as for <hi>D. Potter</hi>'s manner of handling thoſe very points, which are utterly beſide the purpoſe; it conſiſts only in bringing vulgar mean Objections, which have been anſwered a thouſand times, yea, and ſome of them are clearly anſwered even in <hi>Charity Miſtaken;</hi> but he takes no knowledge at all of any ſuch anſwers, and much leſs doth he apply himſelf to confute them. He alledgeth alſo Authors with ſo great corruption and fraud, as I would not have believed, if I had not found it by clear and frequent experience. In his ſecond <hi>Edition,</hi> he hath indeed left out one or two groſs corruptions, amongſt many others no leſs notorious, having, as it ſeems, been warned by ſome friends, that they could not ſtand with his credit: but even in this his ſecond <hi>Edition</hi> he retracts them not at all, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that he was miſtaken in the <hi>Firſt,</hi> and ſo his Reader of the firſt <hi>Edition</hi> ſhall ever be deceived by him, though withall he read the <hi>Second.</hi> For preventing of which inconvenience, I have thought it neceſſary to take notice of them, and to diſcover them in my <hi>Reply.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. And for concluſion of this point I will only ſay, that <hi>D. Potter</hi> might well have ſpared his pains if he had ingenuouſly acknowledged, where the whole ſubſtance, yea and ſometime the very words and phraſes of his Book may be found in far briefer manner, namely, in a <hi>Sermon</hi> of <hi>D. Uſher</hi>'s preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our late Soveraign Lord <hi>King James,</hi> the 20. of June 1624. at <hi>Wanſted,</hi> containing <hi>A Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Univerſality of the Church of Chriſt, and the Unity of Faith profeſſed therein;</hi> which Sermon having been roundly and wittily confuted by a Catholique Divine, under the name of <hi>Paulus Veridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> within the compaſs of about four ſheets of Paper, <hi>D. Potter's Anſwer to Charity Miſtaken</hi> was in effect confuted before it appeared. And this may ſuffice for a general Cenſure of his Anſwer to <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Miſtaken.</hi>

                  <p n="6">
                     <note place="margin">Concerning my Reply.</note>6. For the ſecond, touching my <hi>Reply:</hi> if you wonder at the Bulk thereof, compared either with <hi>Charity Miſtaken,</hi> or <hi>D. Potter's Anſwer,</hi> I deſire you to conſider well of what now I am about to ſay, and then I hope you will ſee, that I was caſt upon a meer neceſſity of not being ſo ſhort, as otherwiſe might peradventure be deſired. <hi>Charity Miſtaken</hi> is ſhort, I grant, and yet very full, and large, for as much as concerned his deſign, which you ſee was not to treat of particular Controverſies in Religion, no not ſo much as to debate whether or no the Romane Church be the only true Church of Chriſt, which indeed would have required a larger Volume, as I have underſtood there was one then coming forth, if it had not been prevented by the Treatiſe of <hi>Charity Miſtaken,</hi> which ſeemed to make the other intended work a little leſs ſeaſonable at that time. But <hi>Charity Miſtaken</hi> proves only in General out of ſome Univerſal Principles, well backed and made good by choice and ſolid Authorities, that of two diſagreeing in points of Faith, one only without repentance can be ſaved; which aim exacted no great bulk. And as for <hi>D. Potter's Anſwer,</hi> even that alſo is not ſo ſhort, as it may ſeem. For if his marginal notes printed in a ſmall letter were transferred into the Text, the Book would appear to be of ſome bulk: though indeed it might have been very ſhort, if he had kept himſelf to the point treated by <hi>Charity Miſtaken,</hi> as ſhall be declared anon. But contrarily, becauſe the queſtion debated betwixt <hi>Charity Miſtaken</hi> and <hi>D. Potter,</hi> is a point of the higheſt conſequence that can be imagined, and in regard that there is not a more pernitious Hereſie, or rather indeed ground of Atheiſm, than a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that men of different Religions may be ſaved, if otherwiſe, forſooth, they lead a kind of civil and moral life: I conceive, that my chief endeavour was not to be employed in anſwering <hi>D. Potter,</hi> but that it was neceſſary to handle the Queſtion it ſelf ſomewhat at large, and not only to prove in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that both Proteſtants and Catholiques cannot be ſaved; but to ſhew alſo, that Salvation cannot be hoped for out of the Catholique Roman Church; and yet withall, not to omit to anſwer all the particulars of <hi>D. Potter</hi>'s Book which may any way import. To this end I thought it fit to divide my <hi>Reply</hi> into <hi>two Parts;</hi> in the former whereof, the main queſtion is handled by a continued diſcourſe without ſtepping aſide to confute the particulars of <hi>D. Potter's Anſwer,</hi> though yet ſo, as even that in this firſt <hi>Part,</hi> I omit not to anſwer ſuch paſſages of his, as I find directly in my way, and naturally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the points whereof I treat: and in the ſecond <hi>Part</hi> I anſwer <hi>D. Potter</hi>'s Treatiſe, <hi>Section</hi> by <hi>Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as they lie in order. I here therefore intreat the Reader, that if heartily he deſire ſatisfaction in this ſo important Queſtion, he do not content himſelf with that which I ſay to <hi>D. Potter</hi> in my ſecond <hi>Part,</hi> but that he take the <hi>Firſt</hi> before him, either all, ot at leaſt ſo much as may ſerve moſt to his purpoſe of being ſatisfied in thoſe doubts which preſs him moſt. For which purpoſe, I have cauſed a Table of the Chapters of the firſt <hi>Part,</hi> together with their Titles and Arguments, to be prefixed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Reply.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. This was then a chief reaſon why I could not be very ſhort. But yet there wanted not alſo divers other cauſes of the ſame effect. For there are ſo ſeveral kinds of Proteſtants through the difference of Tenets which they hold, as that if a man convince but one kind of them, the reſt will conceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be as truly unſatisfied, and even unſpoken to, as if nothing had been ſaid therein at all. As for example: Some hold a neceſſity of a perpetual viſible Church, and ſome hold no ſuch neceſſity. Some of them hold it neceſſary to be able to prove it diſtinct from ours; and others, that their buſineſs is diſpatched when they have proved ours to have been alwayes viſible: for then they will conceive that theirs hath been ſo: And the like may be truly ſaid of very many other particulars. Beſides it is <hi>D. Potter</hi>'s faſhion, (wherein as he is very far from being the firſt, ſo I pray God he prove the laſt of that humour) to touch in a word many trivial old Objections, which, if they be not all anſwered, it will and muſt ſerve the turn, to make the ignorant ſort of men believe and brag, as if ſome main unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable matter had been ſubtilly and purpoſely omitted; and every body knows that ſome Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be very plauſibly made in few words, the clear and ſolid anſwer whereof will require more leaves of paper than one. And in particular <hi>D. Potter</hi> doth couch his corruption of Authors within the compaſs of ſo few lines, and with ſo great confuſedneſs and fraud, that it requires much time, pains, and paper to open them ſo diſtinctly, as that they may appear to every man's eye. It was alſo neceſſary to ſhew what <hi>D. Potter</hi> omits in <hi>Charity Miſtaken,</hi> and the importance of what is omitted, and ſometimes to ſet down the very words themſelves that are omitted, all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64345:18"/>words themſelves that are omitted, all which could not but add to the quantity of my <hi>Reply.</hi> And as for the <hi>quality</hi> thereof, I deſire thee (good Reader) to believe, that whereas nothing is more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than Books for anſwering of Books: yet I was ſo ill furniſhed in this kind, that I was forced to omit the examination of divers Authors cited by <hi>D. Potter,</hi> meetly upon neceſſity; though I did very well perceive by moſt apparent circumſtances, that I muſt probably have been ſure enough ſo finde them plainly miſalledged, and much wronged: and for the few which are examined, there hath not wanted ſome difficulties to do it. For the times are not for all men alike; and <hi>D. Potter</hi> hath much advantage therein. But Truth is truth, and will ever be able to juſtifie it ſelf in the midſt of all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which may occurr. And as for me, when I alledge Proteſtant Writers as well Domeſtical as For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain, I willingly and thankfully acknowledge my ſelf obliged for divers of them to the Author of the Book entituled, <hi>The Proteſtant's Apology for the Romane Church,</hi> who calls himſelf <hi>John Breerly,</hi> whoſe care, exactneſs, and fidelity is ſo extraordinary great, as that he doth not only cite the Books, but the Editions alſo, with the place and time of their Printing, yea and often the very page, and line, where the words are to be had. And if you happen not to finde what he cites, yet ſuſpend your judgement, till you have read the corrections placed at the end of his Book; though it be alſo true, that after all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and faithfulneſs on his behalf, it was not in his power to amend all the faults of the Print: in which Prints we have difficulty enough for many evident reaſons, which muſt needs occurr to any prudent man.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And foraſmuch as concerns the manner of my <hi>Reply,</hi> I have procured to do it without all bitterneſs or gall of invective words, both for as much as may import either Proteſtants in general, or <hi>D. Potter</hi>'s perſon in particular; unleſs, for example, he will call it bitterneſs for me to term a groſs impertinency, a <hi>ſleight,</hi> or a <hi>corruption,</hi> by thoſe very names, without which I do not know how to expreſs the things; and yet therein I can truly affirm that I have ſtudied how to deliver them in the moſt moderate way, to the end I might give as little offence as poſſibly I could, without betraying the Cauſe. And if any unfit phraſe may peradventure have eſcaped my pen (as I hope none hath) it was beſide, and againſt my intention, though <hi>I</hi> muſt needs profeſs, that <hi>D. Potter</hi> gives ſo many and ſo juſt occaſions of being round with him, as that perhaps ſome will judge me to have been rather remiſs, than moderate. But ſince in the very title of my <hi>Reply</hi> I profeſs to <hi>maintain Charity,</hi> I conceive that the exceſs will be more excuſable amongſt all kinds of men, if it fall to be in mildneſs, than if it had appeared in too much zeal. And if <hi>D. Potter</hi> have a mind to charge me with ignorance or any thing of that nature, I can, and will eaſe him of that labour, by acknowledging in my ſelf as many and more perſonal defects than he can heap upon me. Truth only, and ſincerity, I ſo much value and profeſs, as that he ſhall never be able to prove the contrary in any one leaſt paſſage or particle againſt me.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <note place="margin">Rules to be obſerved, if <hi>D. Potter</hi> intend a Rejoynder.</note>9. In the third and laſt place, I have thought fit to expreſs my ſelf thus. If <hi>D. Potter,</hi> or any other reſolve to anſwer my <hi>Reply;</hi> I deſire that he will obſerve ſome things which may tend to his own repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the ſaving of my unneceſſary pains, and eſpecially to the greater advantage of truth. I wiſh then that he would be careful to conſider, wherein the point of every difficulty conſiſts, and not imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently to ſhoot at Rovers, and affectedly miſtake one thing for another. As for example, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe (for as much as conecrns the queſtion between <hi>D. Potter</hi> and <hi>Charity Miſtaken,</hi>) doth he ſo often and ſeriouſly labour to prove, that Faith is not reſolved into the Authority of the Church, as into the formal <hi>Object</hi> and <hi>Motive</hi> thereof? Or that all Points of Faith are contained in Scripture? Or that the Church cannot make new Articles of Faith? Or that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it ſignifies that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church or Dioceſs, is not all one with the Univerſal Church? Or that the Pope as a private Doctor may err? With many other ſuch points as will eaſily appear in their proper places. It will alſo be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for him not to put certain Doctrines upon us, from which he knows we diſclaim as much as himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. I muſt in like manner intreat him not to recite my reaſons and diſcourſes by halfs, but to ſet them down faithfully and entirely, for as much as in very deed concerns the whole ſubſtance of the thing in queſtion: becauſe the want ſometime of one word, may chance to make void, or leſſen the force of the whole Argument. And I am the more ſolicitous about giving this particular caveat, becauſe I find how ill he hath complied with the promiſe which he made in his Preface to the Reader, not to omit <hi>without anſwer any one thing of moment in all the diſcourſe of Charity Miſtaken.</hi> Neither will this courſe be a cauſe that his <hi>Rejoynder</hi> grow too large, but it will be occaſion of brevity to him, and free me alſo from the pains of ſetting down all the words which he omits, and himſelf of demonſtrating, that what he omitted was not material. Nay, I will aſſure him, that if he keep himſelf to the point of every dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficulty, and not weary the Reader, and overcharge his margent with unneceſſary quotations of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors in Greek and Latine, and ſometime alſo in Italian and French, together with Proverbs, Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Poets, and ſuch Grammatical ſtuff, nor affect to cite a multitude of our Catholique School-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines to no purpoſe at all; his Book will not exceed a competent ſize, nor will any man in reaſon be offended with that length which is regulated by neceſſity. Again, before he come to ſet down his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, or propoſe his Arguments, let him conſider very well what may be replyed, and whether his own objections may not be retorted againſt himſelf, as the Reader will perceive to have hapned often to his diſadvantage in my <hi>Reply</hi> againſt him. But eſpecially I expect, and Truth it ſelf exacts at his hand, that he ſpeak clearly and diſtinctly, and not ſeek to walk in darkneſs, ſo to delude and deceive his Reader, now ſaying, and then denying, and alwayes ſpeaking with ſuch ambiguity, as that his greateſt care may ſeem to conſiſt in a certain Art to find a ſhift, as his occaſions might chance, either now, or hereafter to require, and as he might fall out to be urged by diverſity of ſeveral Arguments. And to the end it may appear that I deal plainly, as I would have him alſo do, I deſire that he declare himſelf concerning theſe points.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Firſt, whether our Saviour Chriſt have not alwayes had, and be not ever to have, a viſible true Church on earth: and whether the contrary Doctrine be not a damnable hereſie.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Secondly, what viſible Church there was before <hi>Luther,</hi> diſagreeing from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and agreeing with the pretended Church of Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p n="13">
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64345:19"/>
13. Thirdly, Since he will be forced to grant, That there can be aſſigned no viſible true Church of Chriſt, diſtinct from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſuch Churches as agreed with her, when <hi>Luther</hi> firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; whether it doth not follow, that ſhe hath not erred Fundamentally; becauſe every ſuch error deſtroyes the nature and beeing of the Church, and ſo our Saviour Chriſt ſhould have had no viſible Church on earth.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Fourthly, if the <hi>Roman</hi> Church did not fall into any Fundamental error, let him tell us how it can be <hi>damnable</hi> to live in her Communion, or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to maintain errors, which are known and confeſſed, not to be Fundamental, or <hi>damnable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. Fiftly, if her Errors were not damnable, nor did exclude ſalvation, how can they be excuſed from <hi>Schiſm,</hi> who forſook her Communion upon pretence of errors, which were not damnable.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Sixthly, if D. <hi>Potter</hi> have a minde to ſay, That her Errors are Damnable, or Fundamental, let him do us ſo much charity, as to tell us, in particular, what thoſe Fundamental errors be. But he muſt ſtill remember (and my ſelf muſt be excuſed, for repeating it) that if he ſay, The <hi>Roman</hi> Church erred Fundamentally, he will not be able to ſhew, that Chriſt our Lord had any viſible Church on earth, when <hi>Luther</hi> appeared: and let him tell us, How Proteſtants had, or can have, any Church which was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, and extended herſelf to all ages, if once he grant that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ceaſed to be the true Church of Chriſt; and conſequently, how they can hope for Salvation, if they deny it to us.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Seventhly, whether any one Error maintained againſt any one Truth, though never ſo ſmall in it ſelf, yet ſufficiently propounded as teſtified or revealed by Almighty God, do not deſtroy the Nature and Unity of Faith, or at leaſt is not a grievous offence excluding Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Eighthly, if this be ſo, how can <hi>Lutherans, Calviniſts, Swinglians,</hi> and all the reſt of diſagreeing Proteſtants, hope for Salvation, ſince it is manifeſt, that ſome of them muſt needs err againſt ſome ſuch truth as is teſtified by Almighty God, either Fundamental, or at leaſt not Fundamental.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Ninthly, we conſtantly urge, and require to have a particular Catalogue of ſuch Points as he cals Fundamental: A Catalogue, I ſay, in <hi>particular,</hi> and not only ſome <hi>general</hi> definition, or deſcription, wherein Proteſtants may perhaps agree, though we ſee that they differ when they come to aſſign what Points in particular be Fundamental; and yet upon ſuch a particular Catalogue much depends: as for example, in particular, Whether or no a man do not err in ſome Point Fundamental or neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and whether or no <hi>Lutherans, Calviniſts,</hi> and the reſt, do diſagree in Fundamentals; which if they do, the ſame heaven cannot receive them all.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Tenthly and laſtly, I deſire that in anſwering to theſe Points, he would let us know diſtinctly, what is the Doctrine of the Proteſtant <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church concerning them, and what he utters only as his own private opinion.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Theſe are the Queſtions, which, for the preſent, I find it fit and neceſſary for me to ask of D. <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> or any other who will defend his cauſe, or impugne ours. And it will be in vain to ſpeak vainly, and to tell me, that a Fool may ask more queſtions in an hour, than a Wiſe man can anſwer in a year; with ſuch idle Proverbs as that. For I ask but ſuch queſtions as for which he gives occaſion in his Book, and where he declares not himſelf, but after ſo ambiguous and confuſed a manner, as that Truth it ſelf can ſcarce tell how to convince him ſo, but that with ignorant and ill judging men, he will ſeem to have ſomewhat left to ſay for himſelf, though Papiſts (as he cals them) and Puritans ſhould preſſe him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wayes at the ſame time: and theſe queſtions concern things alſo of high importance, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the knowledge of God's Church, and true Religion, and conſequently, Salvation of the ſoul, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends. And now becauſe he ſhall not taxe me with being like thoſe men in the Goſpel, whom our bleſſed Lord and Saviour charged with laying heavy burdens upon other mens ſhoulders, who yet would not touch them with their finger: I oblige my ſelf to anſwer upon any demand of his, both to all theſe Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, if he find that I have not done it already, and to any other, concerning matter of Faith that he ſhall ask. And I will tell him very plainly, what is Catholique Doctrin, and what is not, that is, what is defined, or what is not defined, and reſts but in diſcuſſion among Divines.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. And it will be here expected, that he perform theſe things, as a man who profeſſeth learning ſhould do, not flying from queſtions which concern things as they are conſidered in their own nature, to accidental or rare circumſtances, of ignorance, incapacity, want of means to be inſtructed, erroneous conſcience, and the like; which being very various and different, cannot be well comprehended under any general Rule. But in delivering general Doctrins, we muſt conſider things, as they be <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> or <hi>per ſe loquendo</hi> (as Divines ſpeak) that is, according to their natures, if all circumſtances concurr pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable thereunto. As for example, ſome may for a time have invincible ignorance, even of ſome Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Article of Faith, through want of capacity, inſtruction, or the like, and ſo not offend either in ſuch ignorance or error, and yet we muſt abſolutely ſay, that error in any one Fundamental point is damnable; becauſe ſo it is, if we conſider things in themſelves, abſtracting from acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal circumſtances in particular perſons: as contrarily, if ſome man judge ſome act of virtue, or ſome indifferent action to be a ſin, in him it is a ſin indeed, by reaſon of his erroneous conſcience; and yet we ought not to ſay abſolutely, that virtuous or indifferent actions are ſins: and in all ſciences we muſt diſtinguiſh the general Rules from their particular Exceptions. And therefore when, for example, he anſwers to our Demand, Whether he hold that Catholiques may be ſaved, or, Whether their pretended errors be Fundamental and Damnable, he is not to change the ſtate of the queſtion, and have recourſe to Ignorance, and the like; but to anſwer concerning the errors being conſidered what they are apt to be in themſelves, and as they are neither increaſed nor diminiſhed, by accidental cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. And the like I ſay of all the other Points, to which I once again deſire an anſwer without any of theſe or the like ambiguous terms, <hi>in ſome ſort, in ſome ſenſe, in ſome degree,</hi> which may be explicated afterward, as ſtrictly or largely as may beſt ſerve his turn; but let him tell us roundly and particularly, in what ſort, in what ſenſe, in what degree he underſtands thoſe, and the like obſcure mincing phraſes.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64345:19"/>If he proceed ſolidly after this manner, and not by way of meer words, more like a Preacher to a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Auditor, than like a learned man with a pen in his hand, thy patience ſhall be the leſs abuſed, and truth will alſo receive more right. And ſince we have already laid the grounds of the queſtion, much may be ſaid hereafter in few words, if (as I ſaid) he keep cloſe to the real point of every diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty without wandring into impertinent diſputes, or multiplying vulgar and thred-bare objections and arguments, or labouring to prove what no man denies, or making a vain oſtentation by citing a number of Schoolmen, which every Puny brought up in Schools is able to do; and if he cite his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors with ſuch ſincerity, as no time need be ſpent in opening his corruptions; and finally, if he ſet himſelf awork with this conſideration, that we are to give a moſt ſtrict account to a moſt juſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Judge, of every period, line, and word that paſſeth under our pen. For if at the latter day we ſhall be arraigned for every idle word which is ſpoken, ſo much more will that be done for every idle word which is written, as the deliberation wherewith it paſſeth makes a man guilty of more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and as the importance of the matter which is treated of in Books concerning true Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, without which no Soul can be ſaved, makes a man's Errors more material, than they would be, if the queſtion were but of toys.</p>

For there is no incongruity, but it may be true <hi>That You and We cannot both be ſaved:</hi> And yet as true, <hi>That without uncharitableneſs you cannot pronounce us damned.</hi> For, all ungrounded and unwarrantable ſentencing men to Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is either in a proriety of ſpeech uncharitable, or elſe (which for my purpoſe is all one,) it is that which Proteſtants mean, when they ſay, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts for damning them are uncharitable. And therefore though the <hi>Author of C. M.</hi> had proved as ſtrongly as he hath done weakly, <hi>that one Heaven could not receive Proteſtants and Papiſts both;</hi> yet certainly, it was very haſtily and unwarrantably, and therefore uncharitably concluded, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants were the part that was to be excluded. As, though Jews and Chriſtians cannot both be ſaved, yet a Jew cannot juſtly, and therefore not charitably, pronounce a Chriſtian damned.</p>

But then ſecondly, to ſhew your dealing with him very injurious; I ſay, he doth ſpeak to this very Queſtion very largely, and very effectually; as by confronting his Work and <hi>Charity M.</hi> together, will preſently appear. <hi>Charity M.</hi> proves, you ſay, in general, <hi>That there is but one Church.</hi> D. <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> tels him, <hi>His labour is loſt in proving the unity of the Catholique Church, whereof there is no doubt or controverſie:</hi> and herein, I hope, you will grant he anſwers right and to the purpoſe. <hi>C. M.</hi> proves (you ſay) ſecondly, <hi>That all Chriſtians are obliged to hearken to the Church.</hi> D. <hi>Potter anſwers, It is true: yet not abſolutely in all things, but only when ſhe commands thoſe things which God doth not countermand.</hi> And this alſo, I hope, is to his purpoſe, though not to yours. <hi>C.M.</hi> proves, you ſay, thirdly, <hi>That the Church muſt be ever viſible and infallible.</hi> For her <hi>Viſibility,</hi> D. <hi>Potter</hi> denies it not; and as for her <hi>Infallibility,</hi> he grants it in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> but <hi>not in Superſtructures. C.M.</hi> proves, you ſay, fourthly, <hi>That to ſeparate one's ſelf from the Churche's Communion, is Schiſm.</hi> D. <hi>Potter</hi> grants it, with this exception, <hi>unleſs there be neceſſary cauſe to do ſo;</hi> unleſs the conditions of her Communion be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently unlawful. <hi>C.M.</hi> proves, you ſay, laſtly, <hi>That to diſſent from her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is Hereſie, though it be in points never ſo few, and never ſo ſmall, and therefore that the diſtinction of points fundamental and unfundamental, as it is applyed by Proteſtants, is wholly vain.</hi> This D.<hi>P.</hi> denies; ſhews the Reaſons brought for it, weak and unconcluding; proves the contrary, by Reaſons unanſwerable: and therefore that <hi>The diſtinction of points into fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and not-fundamental, as it is applyed by Proteſtants, is very good.</hi> Upon theſe grounds you ſay, <hi>C.M.</hi> clearly evinces, <hi>That any leaſt difference in faith cannot ſtand with ſalvation, and therefore ſeeing Catholiques and Proteſtants diſagree in very many points of faith, they both cannot hope to be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance,</hi> you muſt mean, without an explicite and particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and dereliction of their errors; for ſo <hi>C.M.</hi> hath declared himſelf p. 14. where he hath theſe words, <hi>We may ſafely ſay that a man who lives in Proteſtancy, and who is ſo far from Repenting it, as that he will not ſo much as acknowledge it to be a ſin, though he be ſufficiently enformed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,</hi> &amp;c. From whence it is evident, that in his judgement there can be no repentance of an errour, without acknowledging it to be a ſin. And to this D. <hi>Potter</hi> juſtly oppoſes: <hi>That both Siaes, by the confeſsion of both Sides, agree in more points than are ſimply and indiſpenſably neceſſary to Salvation, and differ only in ſuch as are not preciſely neceſſary: That it is very poſsible, a man may die in error, and yet die with Repentance, as for all his ſins of ignorance, ſo, in that number, for the errors in which he dies; with a repentance though not explicite and particular which is not ſimply required, yet implicit and general which is ſufficient: ſo that he cannot but hope, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the goodneſs of God, that the truth is retained on both Sides: eſpecially thoſe, of the neceſsity of Repentance from dead Works and Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, if they be put in practice, may be an Antidote againſt the errors held on either Side; to ſuch he means, and ſays, as being diligent in ſeeking truth, and deſirous to find it, yet miſs of it through humane frailty, and die in errour.</hi> If you will but attentively conſider and compare the undertaking of <hi>C. M.</hi> and D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s performance in all theſe points, I hope, you will be ſo ingenuous as to acknowledge, that you have injured him much, in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting tergiverſation to him, and pretending that <hi>through his whole Book he hath not once truly and really fallen upon the Point in Queſtion.</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:64345:20"/>Neither may you or <hi>C.

For we may and do pretend that before <hi>Luther there were many true Churches, beſides, the Roman,</hi> which agreed not with her: in particular, <hi>The Greek Church.</hi> So that what you ſay is evidently true, is indeed evidently falſe. Beſides, if he had had any neceſſity to make uſe of you in this matter, he needed not for this end to ſay that now in your Church Salvation may be had, but only that before <hi>Lurhers</hi> time it might be: Then when your means of knowing the Truth were not ſo great, and when your ignorance might be more invincible, and therefore more excuſable.

For certainly, no Conſequence can be more palpable than this;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64345:21"/>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth err in this or that, therefore it is not infallible. And this perhaps you perceived your ſelf, and therefore demanded not, <hi>Since they be not fundamental, what imports it whether we hold them or no?</hi> ſimply: But, <hi>for as much as concerns our poſsibility to be ſaved.</hi> As if we were not bound by the love of God and the love of Truth to be zealous in the defence of all Truths, that are any way profitable, though not ſimply neceſſary to ſalvation!

As the doctrine of Indulgences may take away the fear of Purgatory, and the doctrine of Purgatory the fear of Hell; as you well know it does too frequently.

Beſides, though the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an Errour may be only ſomething profitable, not neceſſary, yet the neglect of it may be a damnable ſin; As, not to regard venial ſins is in the Doctrine of your Schools, mortal. Laſtly, as venial ſins, you ſay, diſpoſe men to mortal; ſo the erring from ſome profitable, though leſſer truth, may diſpoſe a man to errour in greater matters. As for example: The belief of the Pope's infallibility is, I hope, not unpardonably damnable to every one that holds it; yet if it be a falſhood (as moſt certainly it is) it puts a man into a very congruous diſpoſition to believe <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> if he ſhould chance to get into that See.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64345:21"/>indeed it is impoſſible. And yet one may very well think, by your ſaying, as you do hereafter, <hi>That the impiety of hereſie conſiſts in calling God's truth in queſtion,</hi> that this ſhould be your meaning. Or do you eſteem all thoſe things <hi>ſufficiently preſented to his underſtanding as Divine truths,</hi> which by you, or any other man, or any Company of men whatſoever, are declared to him to be ſo? I hope you will not ſay ſo: for this were to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige a man to believe all the Churches, and all the men in the world, whenſoever they pretend to propoſe Divine Revelations. D. <hi>Potter,</hi> I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you from him, would never have told you this neither. Or do you mean by <hi>ſufficiently propounded as Divine Truths,</hi> all that your Church propounds for ſuch? That you may not, neither; For the Queſtion between us, is this; <hi>Whether your Churches Propoſition be a ſufficient Propoſition?</hi> And therefore to ſuppoſe this, is to ſuppoſe the Queſtion; which you know in Reaſoning is always a fault. Or laſtly, do you mean (for I know not elſe what poſſibly you can mean,) by <hi>ſufficiently preſented to his underſtanding as revealed by God;</hi> that which, all things conſidered, is ſo propoſed to him, that he might and ſhould and would believe it to be true and revealed by God, were it not for ſome voluntary and avoidable fault of his own that interpoſeth it ſelf between his underſtanding and the truth preſented to it? This is the beſt conſtruction that I can make of your words; and if you ſpeak of truths thus propoſed and rejected, let it be as damnable, as you pleaſe, to deny or disbelieve them. But then I cannot but be amaz'd to hear you ſay, That D. <hi>Potter never tells you whether there be any other Points of faith, beſides thoſe which we are bound to believe explicitely, which a man may deny or disbelieve, though they be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently preſented to his underſtanding as truths revealed or teſtified by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God;</hi> ſeeing the light it ſelf is not more clear than D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of himſelf for the Negative in this Queſtion. p. 245, 246, 247, 249, 250. of his Book. Where he treats at large of this very Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, beginning his diſcourſe thus. <q>
                        <hi>It ſeems fundamental to the faith, and for the ſalvation of every member of the Church, that he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and believe all ſuch points of faith, as whereof he may be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that they belong to the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> To this conviction he requires three things; <hi>Clear Revelation, Sufficient Propoſition, and Capacity and Underſtanding in the Hearer. For want of clear Revelation, he frees the Church before Chriſt and the Diſciples of Chriſt, from any damnable errour, though they believed not thoſe things, which he that ſhould now deny, were no Chriſtian. To Sufficient Propoſition, he requires two things:</hi> 1. <hi>That the points be perſpicuouſly laid open in themſelves.</hi> 2. <hi>So forcibly, as may ſerve to remove reaſonable doubts to the contrary, and to ſatisfie a teachable mind concerning it, againſt the principles in which he hath been bred to the Contrary. This Propoſition, he ſays, is not limited to the Pope or Church, but extended to all means whatſoever, by which a man may be convinced in conſcience, that the matter propoſed is divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which he profeſſes to be done ſufficiently, not only when his conſcience doth expreſly bear witneſs to the truth; but when it would do ſo, if it were not choaked, and blinded by ſome unruly and unmortified luſt in the will. The difference being not great between him that is wilfully blind, and him that knowingly gainſayeth the Truth. The third thing he requires, is Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and Ability to apprehend the Propoſal, and the Reaſons of it: the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64345:22"/>want whereof excuſeth fools and madmen, &amp;c. But where there is no ſuch impediment, and the will of God is ſufficiently propounded, there</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he that oppoſeth is convinced of errour; and he who is thus convinced, is an Heretique; and hereſie is a work of the Fleſh which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth from ſalvation,</hi> (he means without Repentance). <hi>And hence it followeth, that it is fundamentall to a Chriſtian's faith, and neceſſary for his ſalvation, that he believe all revealed truths of God, whereof he may be convinced that they are from God.</hi>
                     </q> This is the concluſion of Doctor <hi>Potter</hi>'s diſcourſe; many paſſages whereof you take notice of in your ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent diſputations, and make your advantage of them. And therefore I cannot but ſay again, that it amazeth me to hear you ſay, that he declines this Queſtion, and never tells you <hi>whether or no there be any other points of faith, which being ſufficiently propounded as divine Revelations may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied and diſ-believed.</hi> He tells you plainly, there are none ſuch: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you cannot ſay, that he tells you not whether there be any ſuch. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, it is almoſt as ſtrange to me, why you ſhould ſay, this was the only thing in queſtion, <hi>Whether a man may deny or disbelieve any point of faith, ſufficiently preſented to his underſtanding as a truth revealed by God.</hi> For to ſay that any thing is a thing in queſtion, me-thinks, at the firſt hearing of the words, imports, that it is by ſome affirmed, and denied by others. Now you affirm, I grant; but, What Proteſtant ever denied, that it was a ſin, to give God the lye? Which is the firſt and moſt obvious ſenſe of theſe words. Or, which of them ever doubted, that to disbelieve is then a fault, when the matter is ſo propoſed to a man, that he might and ſhould, and, were it not for his own fault, would believe it? Certainly, he that queſtions either of theſe, juſtly deſerves to have his wits called in queſtion. Produce any one Proteſtant that ever did ſo, and I will give you leave to ſay, It is the only thing in queſtion. But then I muſt tell you, that your enſuing Argument, <hi>viz. To deny a truth witneſſed by God is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, But of two that diſagree one muſt of neceſsity deny ſome ſuch truth, Therefore one only can be ſaved;</hi> is built upon a ground clean different from this poſtulate. For though it be always a fault to deny what either I do know, or ſhould know, to be teſtified by <hi>God;</hi> yet that which by a cleanly conveyance you put in the place hereof, <hi>To deny a truth witneſſed by God</hi> ſimply, without the circumſtance of <hi>being known or ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,</hi> is ſo far from being certainly damnable, that it may be many times done without any the leaſt fault at all. As if God ſhould teſtifie ſomething to a man in the <hi>Indies,</hi> I that had no aſſurance of this teſtification ſhould not be oblig'd to believe it. For in ſuch caſes the Rule of the Law hath place, <hi>Idem eſt non eſſe &amp; non apparere:</hi> not to be at all and not to appear to me, is to me all one. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken unto you</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>you had had no ſin.</hi>

And yet I believe you will confeſs, that God had not then declared himſelf about <hi>Eaſter,</hi> nor hath now about <hi>Chriſtmaſs.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſome good Catholique Biſhops excommunicated and damned others for <hi>holding there were Antipodes:</hi> and in this queſtion I would fain know on which ſide was the ſufficient propoſal. <hi>The contra-Remonſtrants</hi> differ from the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> about the point of Predetermination as a matter of faith: I would know in this thing alſo, which way God hath declared himſelf; whether for Predetermination or againſt it. <hi>Stephen</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> held it as a matter of faith and Apoſtolique Tradition, <hi>That Heretiques gave true Baptiſm:</hi> Others there were, and they as good Catholiques as he, that held that this was neither matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> nor matter of <hi>Truth. Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> held the doctrine of the <hi>Millenaries</hi> as a matter of <hi>faith:</hi> and though <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> deny it, yet you, I hope, will affirm, that ſome good Chriſtians held the contrary. S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> I am ſure, held <hi>the communicating of Infants</hi> as much A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolique tradition, as the <hi>Baptizing</hi> of them: whether the Biſhop and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of his time, held ſo too, or held otherwiſe, I deſire you to determine. But, ſure I am, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at this preſent holds the contrary. The ſame S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> held it no matter of faith that the <hi>Biſhops of</hi> Rome <hi>were Judges of Appeals</hi> from all parts of the Church Catholique, no not in <hi>Major Cauſes</hi> and <hi>Major Perſons:</hi> whether the Biſhop or Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did then hold the contrary, do you reſolve me; but now I am reſolv'd, they do ſo. In all theſe differences, the point in queſtion is eſteemed and propoſed by one ſide at leaſt as a matter of <hi>faith,</hi> and by the other rejected, as not ſo: and either this is to diſagree in matters of faith, or you will have no means to ſhew that we do diſagree. Now then to ſhew you how weak and ſandy the foundation is, on which the whole fabrick both of your Book and Church depends, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me briefly to this <hi>Dilemma.</hi> Either, in theſe oppoſitions, one of the oppoſite Parts erred damnably, and denied God's truth ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; or they did not. If they did, then they which do deny God's truth ſufficiently propounded, may go to heaven; and then you are raſh and uncharitable in excluding us, though we were guilty of this fault. If not, then there is no ſuch neceſſity that of two diſagreeing about a matter of faith, one ſhould deny God's truth ſufficiently propounded. And ſo the Major and Minor of your Argument, are proved falſe. Yet though they were as true as Goſpel, and as evident as Mathematical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, the Concluſion (ſo impertinent is it to the Premiſes) might ſtill be falſe. For that which naturally iſſues from theſe Propoſitions is not, <hi>Therefore one only can be ſaved:</hi> But, <hi>Therefore one of them does ſomething that is damnable.</hi> But, with what Logick, or what Charity you can inferr ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the immediate production of the former premiſes, or as a Corollary from this Concluſion, <hi>Therefore one only can be ſaved,</hi> I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; unleſs you will pretend that this conſequence is good, Such a one doth ſomething damnable, therefore he ſhall certainly be damned: Which whether it be not to overthrow the Article of our Faith, which promiſes <hi>remiſsion of ſins</hi> upon repentance; and conſequently, to ruine the Goſpel

To the firſt then, about <hi>the Perpetuity of the viſible Church,</hi> my Anſwer is: That I believe our Saviour, ever ſince his Aſcention, hath had in ſome place or other a Viſible true Church on earth: I mean a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men, that profeſſed at leaſt ſo much truth as was abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for their Salvation. And I believe that there will be ſomewhere or other ſuch a Church to the Worlds end. But the contrary Doctrin, I do at no hand believe to be a damnable Hereſie.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 12. To the ſecond, What <hi>Viſible Church there was before</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>diſagreeing from the</hi> Roman? I anſwer, that before <hi>Luther</hi> there were many Viſible Churches, in many things diſagreeing from the <hi>Roman:</hi> But not that the whole Catholique Church diſagreed from her, becauſe ſhe her ſelf was a Part of the Whole, though much corrupted. And to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to name a Catholike Church diſagreeing from her, is to make her no Part of it, which we do not, nor need not pretend. And <hi>for men agreeing with Proteſtants in all points,</hi> we will then produce them, when you ſhall either prove it neceſſary to be done, which you know we abſolutely deny; or when you ſhall produce a perpetual ſucceſſion of Profeſſors, which in all points have agreed with you, and diſagreed from you in nothing. But this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64345:24"/>my promiſe, to deal plainly with you, I conceive, and ſo intended it to be very like his, who undertook to drink up the Sea, upon condition, that he to whom the promiſe was made, ſhould firſt ſtop the Rivers from running in. For this unreaſonable requeſt which you make to us, is to your ſelves ſo impoſſible, that in the very next Age after the Apoſtles, you will never be able to name a man, whom you can prove to have agreed with you in all things, nay (if you ſpeak of ſuch, whoſe Works are extant and unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) whom we cannot prove to have diſagreed from you in many things. Which I am ſo certain of, that I will venture my credit, and my life upon it.</p>

To the third, <hi>Whether, ſeeing there cannot be aſsigned any viſible true Church diſtinct from the</hi> Roman, <hi>it follows not that ſhe erred not fundamentally?</hi> I ſay, in our ſenſe of the word <hi>Fundamental,</hi> it does follow. For, if it be true, that there was then no Church diſtinct from the <hi>Roman,</hi> then it muſt be, either becauſe there was no Church at all, which we deny: Or becauſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was the whole Church, which we alſo deny: Or becauſe ſhe was a Part of the Whole, which we grant. And if ſhe were a true part of the Church, then ſhe retained thoſe truths which were ſimply neceſſary to Salvation, and held no errours which were inevitably and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonably deſtructive of it. For this is preciſely neceſſary to conſtitute any man or any Church a member of the Church Catholique. In our ſenſe therefore of the word <hi>Fundamental,</hi> I hope ſhe erred not fundamentally: but in your ſenſe of the word, I fear ſhe did: that is, ſhe held ſomething to be Divine Revelation, which was not; ſomething not to be, which was.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 14. To the fourth. <hi>How it could be damnable to maintain her Errors, if they were not fundamental?</hi> I anſwer.
<list>
                        <item>1. Though it were not damnable, yet if it were a fault, it was not to be done. For a Venial ſin with you is not damnable; yet you ſay, it is not to be committed for the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any good. <hi>Non eſt faciendum malum vel minimum, ut eveniat bonum vel maximum.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. It is damnable to maintain an error againſt conſcience, though the error in it ſelf, and to him that believes it, be not damnable. Nay the profeſſion not only of an error, but even of a truth, if not believed, when you think on it again, I believe you will confeſs to be a mortal ſin; unleſs you will ſay, Hypocriſie and Simulation in Religion is not ſo.</item>
                        <item>3. Though we ſay, the Errors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church were not deſtructive of Salvation, but pardonable even to them that died in them, upon a general repentance: yet we deny not but in <hi>themſelves they were damnable.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
Nay, the very ſaying they were pardonable, implies they needed pardon, and therefore in themſelves were damnable: damnable <hi>meritoriouſly,</hi> though not <hi>effectually.</hi> As a poyſon may be deadly in it ſelf, and yet not kill him, that together with the Poyſon takes an Antidote: or as Felony may deſerve death, and yet not bring it on him that obtains the Kings Pardon.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 15. To the fifth. <hi>How they can be excuſed from Schiſm, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook her Communion upon pretence of Errors which were not damnable!</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. All that we forſake in you, is only the belief, and practice, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of your Errors. Hereupon you caſt us out of your Communion. And then with a ſtrange, and contradictious, and ridiculous hypocriſie, complain that we forſake it. As if a man ſhould thruſt his friend out of doors, and then be offended at his departure. But for us not to forſake the belief of your Errors, having diſcovered them to be Errors, was impoſſible; and therefore to do ſo could not be damnable, believing them to be Errors. Not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64345:24"/>the practice and profeſſion of them, had been damnable hypocriſie; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that (which you vainly run away with, and take for granted) thoſe Errors in themſelves were not damnable. Now to do ſo, and, as matters now ſtand, not to forſake your Communion, is apparently contradictious: ſeeing the condition of your Communion is, that we muſt profeſs to believe all your Doctrins not only to be damnable Errors (which wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l not content you,) but alſo to be certain and neceſſary and revealed Truths. So that to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Why we forſake your Communion upon pretence of Errors which were not damnable, is, in effect, to demand why we forſook it upon our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking it! For to pretend that there are Errors in your Church though not damnable, is <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> to forſake your Communion and to do that which both in your account, and, as you think, in Gods account, puts him that does ſo, out of your Communion. So that either you muſt free your Church, from requiring the beliefe of any Error whatſoever, damnable and not damnable; or, whether you will or no you muſt free us from Schiſm. For Schiſm there cannot be, in leaving your Communion, unleſs we were obliged to continue in it. Man cannot be obliged by Man, but to what either formally or vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally he is obliged by God; for, all juſt power is from God. God the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Truth neither can nor will oblige us to believe any the leaſt and the moſt innocent falſhood to be a Divine truth, that is, to erre; nor, to profeſs a known Error, which is to lie. So that if you require the beliefe of any Error among the conditions of your Communion, our Obligation to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with you ceaſeth, and ſo the imputation of Schiſm to us vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth into nothing; but lies heavy upon you for, making our ſeparation from you juſt and neceſſary, by requiring unneceſſary and unlawful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of your Communion. Hereafter therefore, I intreat you, let not your demand be, How could we forſake your Communion without Schiſm, ſeeing you erred not damnably? But, How we could do ſo without Schiſm, ſeeing you erred not at all? which if either you do prove, or we cannot diſprove it, we will (I at leaſt will for my part) return to your Communion, or ſubſcribe my ſelf Schiſmatique. In the mean time, <gap reason="foreign">

To the ſeventh, <hi>Whether error againſt any one truth ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently propounded as teſtified by God, deſtroy not the Nature and Unity of faith, or, at leaſt, is not a grievous offence excluding ſalvation?</hi> I anſwer; If you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as you ſeem to do, the propoſition ſo ſufficient, that the party to whom it is made is convinced that it is from God, ſo that the denial of it involves alſo with it the denial of Gods veracity; any ſuch Error deſtroys both faith and ſalvation. But if the Propoſal be only ſo ſufficient, not, that the party to whom it is made is convinced, but only that he ſhould, and, but for his own fault, would have been convinced of the Divine Verity of the Doctrin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64345:25"/>The crime then is not ſo great; for, the beliefe of Gods Veracity may well conſiſt with ſuch an Error. Yet a fault I confeſs it is, and (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Repentance) damnable, if, all circumſtances conſidered, the Propoſal be ſufficient. But then I muſt tell you, that the Propoſal of the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church is only pretended to be ſufficient for this purpoſe, but is not ſo: eſpecially all the Rayes of the Divinity, which they pretend to ſhine ſo conſpicuouſly in her Propoſals, being ſo darkned and even extinguiſhed with a cloud of contradiction, from Scripture, Reaſon, and the Ancient Church.</p>

                     </list>
This if they perform (as I hope many on all Sides do) truly and ſincerely, it is impoſſible but that they ſhould believe aright in all things neceſſary to ſalvation; that is, in all thoſe things which appertain to the Covenant between God and man in Chriſt; for ſo much, is not only plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but frequently, contained in Scripture. And believing aright touching the Covenant, if they for their parts perform the condition required of them, which is ſincere obedience, Why ſhould they not expect that God will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his promiſe and give them ſalvation? For, as for other things which lie without the Covenant, and are therefore leſſe neceſſary, if by reaſon of the ſeeming conflict which is oftentimes between Scripture and Reaſon, and Authority on the one Side; and Scripture, Reaſon, and Authority on the other; if by reaſon of the variety of tempers, abilities, educations, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable prejudices, whereby mens underſtandings are variouſly formed and faſhioned, they do embrace ſeveral Opinions, whereof ſome muſt be erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous; to ſay that God will damn them for ſuch Errors, who are lovers of Him, and lovers of Truth, is to rob man of his comfort, and God of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; it is to make Man deſperate, and God a Tyrant. <hi>But they deny Truths teſtified by God, and therefore ſhall be damned.</hi> Yes, if they knew them to be thus teſtified by him and yet would deny them, that were to give God the lie, and queſtionleſs damnable. But if you ſhould deny a truth which God had teſtified, but only to a man in the <hi>Indies,</hi> (as I ſaid before), and this teſtification you had never heard of, or at leaſt had no ſufficient reaſon to believe that God had ſo teſtified, Would not you think it a hard caſe to be damned for ſuch a denial? Yet conſider, I pray, a little more attentively the difference between them, and you will preſently acknowledge, the queſtion between them is not at any time, or in any thing, Whether God ſays true or no? or, Whether he ſays this or no? But, ſuppoſing he ſays this, and ſays true, Whether he means this or no? As for example: Between <hi>Lutherans, Calviniſts,</hi> and <hi>Zwinglians,</hi> it is agreed that Chriſt ſpake theſe words, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> and that, whatſoever he meant in ſaying ſo is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64345:25"/>true: But what he meant and how he is be underſtood, that is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. So that though ſome of them deny a Truth by God intended, yet you can with no Reaſon or Juſtice accuſe them of denying the truth of Gods Teſtimony, unleſs you can plainly ſhew that God hath declared, and that plainly and clearly, what was his meaning in theſe words. I ſay, <hi>plainly and clearly.</hi> For he that ſpeaks obſcurely and ambiguouſly, and no where declares himſelf plainly, ſure he hath no reaſon to be much offended if he be miſtaken. When therefore you can ſhew, that in this and all other their Controverſies, God hath interpoſed his Teſtimony on one Side or other; ſo that either they do ſee it, and will not; or, were it not for their own voluntary and avoidable fault, might and ſhould ſee it and do not; let all ſuch Errors be as damnable as you pleaſe to make them. In the mean while, if they ſuffer themſelves neither to be betraid into their Errors, nor kept in them by any ſin of their will; if they do their beſt endevour to free themſelves from all Errors, and yet fail of it through humane frailty; ſo well am I perſwaded of the goodneſs of God, that if in me alone, ſhould meet a confluence of all ſuch Errors of all the Proteſtants in the World, that were thus qualified, I ſhould not be ſo much afraid of them all, as I ſhould be to ask pardon for them. For, whereas that which you affright us with, of calling Gods Veracity in Queſtion, is but a Panick fear, a fault that no man thus qualified, is, or can be guilty of; to ask pardon of ſimple and purely involuntary Errors is tacitely to imply that God is angry with us for them, and that were to impute to him the ſtrange tyranny of <hi>requiring brick, when he gives no ſtraw; of expecting to gather, where he ſtrewed not; to reap where he ſowed not:</hi> of being offended with us for not doing what he knows we cannot do. This I ſay upon a ſuppoſition, that they do their beſt endevours to know Gods will and do it; which he that denies to be poſſible, knows not what he ſayes; for he ſayes in effect, That men cannot do, what they can do; for to do what a man can do, is to do his beſt endevour. But becauſe this Suppoſition, though certainly poſſible, is very rare, and admirable, I ſay, ſecondly, that I am verily perſwaded, that God will not impute errors to them as ſins, who uſe ſuch a meaſure of induſtry, in finding truth, as humane <hi>prudence</hi> and ordinary <hi>diſcretion</hi> (their abilities and opportunities, their diſtractions and hinderances, and all other things conſidered) ſhall adviſe them unto, in a matter of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. But if herein alſo we fail, then our errors begin to be malignant, and juſtly imputable; as offences againſt God, and that love of his truth which he requires in us. You will ſay then, that for thoſe erring <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> which are in this caſe, which evidently are far the greater patt, they ſin damnably in erring, and therefore there is little hope of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To which I anſwer, that the conſequence of this Reaſon is ſomewhat ſtrong againſt a <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> but much weakned by coming out of the mouth of a <hi>Papiſt.</hi> For all ſins with you are not damnable; and therefore Proteſtants errors might be ſins, and yet not damnable. But yet out of courteſie to you, we will remove this rubbe out of your way; and for the preſent ſuppoſe them <hi>mortal ſins;</hi> and is there then no hope of Salvation for him that commits them? Not, you will ſay, if he die in them without repentance; and ſuch Proteſtants you ſpeak of, <hi>Who without repentance die in their Errors.</hi> Yea but what if they die in their errors with repentance? then I hope you will have Charity enough
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64345:26"/>to think they may be ſaved. <hi>Charity Miſtaken</hi> takes it indeed for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this ſuppoſition is deſtructive of it ſelf;<note place="margin">In the place above quoted.</note> and that it is impoſſible, and incongruous, that a man ſhould repent of thoſe errors wherein he dies; or die in thoſe whereof he repents. But it was wiſely done of Him to take it for granted; for moſt certainly, He could not have ſpoken one word of ſenſe for the confirmation of it. For ſeeing <hi>Proteſtants</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as well as you, God's infinite and moſt admirable perfections in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, more than moſt worthy of all poſſible love: ſeeing they believe, as well as you, his infinite goodneſs to them, in creating them of nothing; in creating them according to his own Image; in creating all things for their uſe and benefit; in ſtreaming down his favours on them every moment of their lives; in deſigning them, if they ſerve him, to infinite and eternal happineſs; in redeeming them, not with corruptible things, but the precious blood of his beloved Son: ſeeing they believe, as well as you, his infinite goodneſs, and patience towards them, in expecting their Converſion; in wooing, alluring, leading, and by all means which his wiſdom can ſuggeſt unto him, and man's nature is capable of, drawing them to Repentance and Salvation: Seeing they believe theſe things as well as you, and, for ought you know, conſider them as much as you, (and if they do not, it is not their Religion, but They that are too blame) what can hinder, but that the conſideration of God's moſt infinite goodneſs to them, and their own almoſt infinite wickedneſs againſt him, God's Spirit co-operating with them, may raiſe them to a true and ſincere and a cordial love of God? And ſeeing ſorrow for having injured or offended the perſon beloved, or when we fear we may have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him, is the moſt natural effect of true love; what can hinder, but that love which hath oft-times conſtrained them to lay down their lives for God, (which, our Saviour aſſures us is the nobleſt ſacrifice we can offer) may produce in them an univerſal ſorrow for all their ſins, both which they know they have committed, and which they fear they may have? In which number, their being negligent, or not diſpaſſionate, or not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudicate enough in ſeeking the truth, and the effect thereof, their errors, if they be ſins, cannot but be comprized. In a word, what ſhould hinder, but that that Prayer—<hi>Delicta ſua quis intelligit? Who can underſtand his faults? Lord, cleanſe thou me from my ſecret ſins,</hi> may be heard and accepted by God, as well from a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> that dies in ſome errors, as from a <hi>Papiſt</hi> that dies in ſome other ſins of Ignorance, which perhaps he might more eaſily have diſcovered to be ſins, than a Proteſtant could his errors to be errors? As well from a Proteſtant, that held ſome error, which (as he conceived) God's word, and his reaſon, (which is alſo in ſome ſort God's word) lead him unto; as from a <hi>Dominican,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps took up his opinion upon truſt, not becauſe he had reaſon to believe it true, but becauſe it was the Opinion of his <hi>Order;</hi> for the ſame man, if he had light upon another Order, would in all probability, have been of the other opinion: For what elſe is the cauſe, that generally <hi>all the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans are of one opinion, and all the Jeſuits of the other?</hi> I ſay, from a <hi>Dominican</hi> who took up his opinion upon truſt; and that ſuch an opinion (if we believe the Writers of your Order) as, if it be granted true, it were not a point-matter what opinions any man held, or what actions any man did; for the beſt would be as bad as the worſt, and worſt the as good as the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64345:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>beſt. And yet ſuch is the partiality of your Hypocriſie, that, of diſagreing Papiſts, neither ſhall deny the truth teſtified by God, but both may hope for ſalvation: but, of diſagreeing Proteſtants (though they differ in the ſame thing,) one ſide muſt deny God's Teſtimony, and be incapable of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. That a <hi>Dominican</hi> through culpable negligence, living and dying in his error, may repent of it, though he knowes it not; or be ſaved, though he do not: But if a Proteſtant do the very ſame thing, in the very ſame point, and die in his error, his caſe is deſperate. The ſum of all that hath been ſaid to this Demand, is this.
<list>
                        <item>1. That no erring Proteſtant denies any truth teſtified by God, under this formality, <hi>as teſtified by him;</hi> nor which they know or believe to be teſtified by him. And therefore it is an horrible calumny in you to ſay, <hi>They call God's Veracity in queſtion.</hi> For God's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted and unqueſtioned Veracity, is to them the ground why they hold all they do hold: neither do they hold any opinion ſo ſtiffly, but they will forgo it rather than this one, <hi>That all which God ſays is true.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. God hath not ſo clearly and plainly declared himſelf in moſt of theſe things which are in Controverſie between Proteſtants, but that an honeſt man, whoſe heart is right to God, and one that is a true lover of God, and of his truth, may, by reaſon of the conflict of contrary Reaſons on both ſides, very eaſily, and therefore excuſably miſtake, and embrace error for truth, and reject truth for error.</item>
                        <item>3. If any Proteſtant or Papiſt be betrayed into, or kept in any Error, by any ſin of his will (as it is to be feared many millions are) ſuch Error is, as the cauſe of it, ſinful and damnable: yet not excluſive of all hope of Salvation, but pardonable, if diſcovered, upon a particular explicite repentance; if not diſcovered, upon a general and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite Repentance for all Sins known and unknown: in which number all ſinful Errors muſt of neceſſity be contained.</item>

For many of you hold the Pope's propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal <hi>Ex Cathedra,</hi> to be ſufficient and obliging: Some, a Councel without a Pope: Some, of neither of them ſeverally, but only both together: Some, not this neither in matter of manners, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknowledges, and tell us, it is all one in effect, as if they denied it ſufficient in matter of faith: Some not in matter of faith neither think this propoſal infallible, without the acceptation of the Church univerſal: Some deny the infallibility of the Preſent Church: and only make the Tradition of all Ages the <hi>infallible Propounder.</hi> Yet if you were agreed, <hi>what, and what only, is the infallible Propounder,</hi> this would not ſatisfie us; nor yet to ſay <hi>that All is Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal which is propounded ſufficiently by him.</hi> For though agreeing in this, yet you might ſtill diſagree <hi>whether ſuch or ſuch a Doctrine were propounded or not: or, if propounded, whether ſufficiently, or only unſufficiently.</hi> And it is ſo
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64345:27"/>known a thing, that in many Points you do ſo, that I aſſure my ſelf you will not deny it. Therefore we conſtantly urge and require a particular and perfect Inventory of all thoſe Divine Revelations, which, you ſay, <hi>are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently propounded; and that, ſuch an one to which all of your Church will ſubſcribe, as neither redundant, nor deficient:</hi> which when you give in with one hand, you ſhall receive a particular Catalogue of ſuch Points as I call <hi>Fundamental,</hi> with the other. Neither may you think me unreaſonable in this Demand, ſeeing upon ſuch a particular Catalogue of your ſufficient Propoſals as much depends, as upon a particular Catalogue of our Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals. As for example; Whether or no a man do not err in ſome Point defined and ſufficiently propoſed: and, whether or no thoſe that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer among you, differ in Fundamentals; which if they do, <hi>One Heaven</hi> (by your own Rule) <hi>cannot receive them All.</hi> Perhaps you will here complain, that this is not to ſatisfie your demand, but to avoid it, and to put you off, as the <hi>Areopagites</hi> did hard cauſes, <hi>ad diem longiſsimum,</hi> and bid you come again an hundred years hence. To deal truly, I did ſo intend it ſhould be. Neither can you ſay my dealing with you is injurious, ſeeing I require no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of you, but that, what you require of others, you ſhould ſhew it poſſible to be done, and juſt and neceſſary to be required. For, for my part, I have great reaſon to ſuſpect, it is neither the one nor the other. For whereas the Verities which are delivered in Scripture, may be very fitly divided into <hi>ſuch as were written becauſe they were neceſſary to be believed;</hi> (of which rank are thoſe only, which conſtitute and make up the Covenant between God and Man in Chriſt): and then <hi>ſuch as are neceſſary to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not in themſelves, but only by accident, becauſe they were written;</hi> Of which rank are many matters of Hiſtory, of Prophecy, of Myſterie, of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, of Oeconomy, and ſuch like, which are evidently not <hi>intrinſecal</hi> to the Covenant: Now, to ſever exactly and punctually theſe Verities one from the other, what is <hi>neceſſary in it ſelf</hi> and antecedently to the writing, from what is but only profitable in it ſelf, and <hi>neceſſary only becauſe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> is a buſineſs of extreme great difficulty, and extreme little neceſſity. For firſt, he that will go about to diſtinguiſh, eſpecially in the Story of our Saviour, what was written becauſe it was <hi>profitable,</hi> from what was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten becauſe <hi>neceſſary,</hi> ſhall find an intricate piece of buſineſs of it, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impoſſible that he ſhould be certain he hath done it, when he hath done it. And then it is apparently unneceſſary to go about it, ſeeing he that believes all, certainly believes all that is neceſſary: And he that doth not believe all (I mean all the undoubted parts of the undoubted Books of Scripture) can hardly believe any, neither have we reaſon to believe he doth ſo. So that, that Proteſtants give you not a Catalogue of Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, it is not from Tergiverſation (as you ſuſpect, who for want of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to them alwayes ſuſpect the worſt,) but from Wiſdom and Neceſſity. For they may very eaſily err in doing it; becauſe though all which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary be plain in Scripture, yet all which is plain, is not therefore written becauſe it was neceſſary. For what greater neceſſity was there that I ſhould know S. <hi>Paul left his Cloak at Troas,</hi> than thoſe <hi>Worlds of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> which our Saviour did, which were never written. And when they had done it, it had been to no purpoſe; There being, as matters now ſtand, as great neceſſity of believing thoſe Truths of Scripture which are not Fundamental, as thoſe that are. You ſee then what reaſon we have to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64345:27"/>decline this hard labour, which you a rigid Task-maſter have here put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. Yet inſtead of giving you a Catalogue of Fundamentals, with which I dare ſay you are reſolved, before it come, never to be ſatisfied, I will ſay that to you, which, if you pleaſe, may do you as much ſervice; and this it is: That it is ſufficient for any man's Salvation that he believe the Scripture: that he endeavour to believe it in the true ſenſe of it, as far as concerns his duty: And that he conform his life unto it either by Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience or Repentance. He that does ſo (and all Proteſtants according to the <hi>Dictamin</hi> of their Religion ſhould do ſo) may be ſecure that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err Fundamentally. And they that do ſo, cannot differ in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. So that, notwithſtanding their differences, and your preſumption, <hi>the ſame Heaven may receive them All.</hi>

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for ought I can ſee, <hi>have I flitted from things conſidered in their own nature, to accidental or rare Circumſtances,</hi> but told you my opinion plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what I thought of your Errors in themſelves: and what as they were qualified or malignified with good or bad circumſtances. Though I muſt tell you truly, that I ſee no reaſon, the Queſtion being of the damnableneſs of Error, <hi>why you ſhould eſteem ignorance, incapacity, want of means to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, accidental</hi> and rare <hi>Circumſtances:</hi> As if knowledge, capacity, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving means of Inſtruction, concerning the truth of your Religion or ours, were not as rare and unuſual in the adverſe part of either, as Ignorance, Incapacity, and want of means of inſtruction. Eſpecially how, erroneous Conſcience can be a rare thing in thoſe that err, or how unerring Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is not much more rare, I am not able to apprehend. So that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider men of different Religions (the ſubject of this Controverſie) in their own nature and <hi>without circumſtances,</hi> muſt be to conſider them, neither as ignorant, nor as knowing: neither as having, nor as wanting means of Inſtruction: neither as with Capacity, nor without it: neither with erroneous, nor yet with unerring conſcience. And then what judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can you pronounce of them, all the goodneſs and badneſs of an Action depending on the Circumſtances? Ought not a Judge being to give ſentence of an Action, to conſider all the Circumſtances of it? or is it poſſible he ſhould judge rightly that doth not ſo? Neither is it to purpoſe, <hi>That Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances being various, cannot be well comprehended under any general rule:</hi> For though under any general rule they cannot, yet under many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rules they may, be comprehended. The Queſtion here is, you ſay, <hi>Whether men of different Religions may be ſaved?</hi> Now the ſubject of this Queſtion is an ambiguous term, and may be determined and inveſted with diverſe and contrary Circumſtances: and accordingly, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry judgements are to be given of it. And who then can be offended with D. <hi>Potter</hi> for diſtinguiſhing before he defines, (the want whereof is the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64345:28"/>chief thing that makes defining dangerous?) Who can find fault with him for ſaying, <hi>If, through want of means of inſtruction, incapacity, invincible or probable ignorance a man die in error, he may be ſaved. But if he be negligent in ſeeking Truth, unwilling to find it, either doth ſee it and will not, or might ſee it and will not, that his caſe is dangerous, and without repentance deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</hi> This is all that D. <hi>Potter</hi> ſays: neither raſhly damning all that are of a different opinion from him, nor ſecuring any that are in matter of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſinfully, that is, willingly erroneous. The Author of this Reply (I will abide by it) ſays the very ſame thing, neither can I ſee what adverſary he hath in the main Queſtion but his own ſhadow; and yet, I know not out of what frowardneſs, finds fault with D. <hi>Potter</hi> for affirming that which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf affirms: And to cloud the matter, whereas the Queſtion is, <hi>Whether men by ignorance, dying in error, may be ſaved,</hi> he would have them conſidered <hi>neither as erring, nor ignorant.</hi> And when the queſtion is, whether <hi>The Errors of Papiſts be damnable,</hi> to which we anſwer, That to them that do or might know them to be errors, they are damnable; to them that do not, they are not: He tels us that <hi>this</hi> is <hi>to change the ſtate of the Queſtion,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeed it is to ſtate the Queſtion, and free it from ambiguity before you anſwer it: <hi>and to have recourſe to Accidental Circumſtances;</hi> as if Ignorance were accidental to error, or as if a man could be conſidered as in error, and not be conſidered as in ignorance of the Truth from which he errs! Certainly, Error againſt a Truth, muſt needs preſuppoſe a neſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it: unleſs you will ſay that a man may at once reſolve for a Truth and reſolve againſt it; aſſent to it, and diſſent from it; know it to be true, and believe it not to be true. Whether Knowledg and Opinion touching the ſame thing may ſtand together, is made a Queſtion in the Schools: But he that would queſtion, Whether knowing a thing and doubting of it, much more, whether knowing it to be true, and believing it to be falſe, may ſtand together, deſerves without queſtion no other Anſwer but laughter. Now if Error and Knowledge cannot conſiſt, then Error and Ignorance muſt be inſeparable. He then that profeſſeth your errors may well be conſidered either as knowing or as Ignorant. But him that does err indeed, you can no more conceive without ignorance, than Long without Quantity, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous without Quality, a Man and not a living Creature, to have gone ten miles and not to have gone five, to ſpeak ſenſe and not to ſpeak. For as the latter in all theſe is implyed in the former, ſo is Ignorance of a Truth, ſuppoſed in Error againſt it. Yet ſuch a man, though not conceivable without ignorance ſimply, may be very well conſidered either as with, or without voluntary and ſinful Ignorance. And he that will give a wiſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this Queſtion, Whether a Papiſt dying a Papiſt may be ſaved, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God's ordinary proceeding; muſt diſtinguiſh him according to theſe ſeveral conſiderations, and ſay, He may be ſaved, If his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance were either invincible, or at leaſt unaffected and probable: if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, without repentance he cannot.</p>
                  <p>To the reſt of this Preface, I have nothing to ſay, ſaving what hath been ſaid, but this, That it is no juſt exception to an argument to call it vulgar and thred-bare.

For we are not always acquainted with what ſufficiency of means he was furniſhed for inſtruction; we do not penetrate his capacity to underſtand his Catechiſt; we have no revelation what light might have cleared his errors, or Contrition retracted his ſins, in the laſt moment before his death. In ſuch particular caſes, we wiſh more apparent ſigns of ſalvation, but do not give any dogmatical ſentence of perdition. How grievous ſins, <hi>Diſobedience, Schiſm,</hi> and <hi>Hereſie</hi> are, is well known. But to diſcern how far the natural maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe great offences might be checked by Ignorance, or by ſome ſuch leſſening circumſtance, is the office rather of <hi>Prudence</hi> than of <hi>Faith.</hi>

                     <p n="4">4. Thus we allow Proteſtants as much Charity, as D. <hi>Potter</hi> ſpares us, for whom in the words above mentioned, and elſewhere, he<note n="(g)" place="margin">See <hi>P.</hi> 39.</note> makes <hi>Ignorance</hi> the beſt hope of ſalvation.

                     <p n="5">5. But yet leſt any man ſhould flatter himſelf with our charitable Mitigations, and thereby wax careleſs in ſearch of the true Church, we deſire him to read the <hi>Concluſion</hi> of the <hi>Second Part,</hi> where this matter is more explained.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And becauſe we cannot determine what <hi>Judgement</hi> may be eſteemed <hi>raſh,</hi> or <hi>prudent,</hi> except by weighing the reaſons upon which it was grounded, we will here, under one aſpect, preſent a Summary of thoſe Principles, from which we infer, that Proteſtancy in it ſelf unrepented deſtroyes Salvation: inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding afterward to prove the truth of every one of the grounds, till, by a concatenation of ſequels, we fall upon the <hi>Concluſion,</hi> for which we are charged with <hi>Want of Charity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. Now, this is our gradation of reaſons: Almighty God, having ordained Mankind to a ſupernatural <hi>End</hi> of eternal felicity, hath in his holy Providence ſetled competent and convenient <hi>Means,</hi> whereby that end may be attained. The univerſal grand Origen of all ſuch means, is the Incarnation and Death of our Bleſſed Saviour, whereby he merited internal grace for us; and founded an <hi>external</hi> viſible Church, provided and ſtored with all thoſe helps which might be neceſſary to Salvation. From hence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that in this Church, among other advantages, there muſt be ſome effectual means to beget and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Faith, to maintain Unity, to diſcover and condemn Hereſies, to appeaſe and reduce Schiſms, and to determine all Controverſies in Religion. For without ſuch means the Church ſhould not be furniſhed with helps ſufficient to ſalvation, nor God afford ſufficient means to attain that End, to which himſelf ordained Mankind. This means to decide Controverſies in Faith and Religion (whether it ſhould be the holy Scripture, or whatſoever elſe) muſt be indued with an Univerſal Infallibility in whatſoever it propoundeth for a divine Truth, that is, as revealed, ſpoken, or teſtified by Almighty God, whether the matter of its nature be great or ſmall. For if it were ſubject to Error in any one thing, we could not in any other yield it infallible aſſent; becauſe we might with good reaſon doubt, whether it chanced not to err in that particular.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Thus far all muſt agree to what we have ſaid, unleſs they have a minde to reduce <hi>Faith</hi> to <hi>Opinion.</hi> And even out of theſe grounds alone, without further proceeding, it undeniably follows, that of two men diſſenting in matters of faith, great or ſmall, few or many, the one cannot be ſaved without repentance, unleſs Ignorance accidentally may in ſome particular perſon plead excuſe. For in that caſe of contrary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, one muſt of neceſſity be held to oppoſe Gods Word, or Revelation ſufficiently repreſented to his underſtanding by an infallible Propounder; which oppoſition to the Teſtimony of God is undoubtedly a damnable ſin, whether otherwiſe, the thing ſo teſtified, be in it ſelf great or ſmall. And thus we have already made good what was promiſed in the argument of this Chapter, that <hi>amongſt men of different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions,</hi> one is only capable of being ſaved.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Nevertheleſs, to the end that men may know in particular what is the ſaid infallible means upon which we are to relie in all things concerning Faith, and accordingly may be able to judge in what ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or danger, more or leſs they live; and becauſe D. <hi>Potter</hi> deſcendeth to divers particulars about Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures and the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we will go forward, and prove, that although Scripture be in it ſelf moſt ſacred, infallible, and divine, yet it alone cannot be <hi>to us a Rule,</hi> or Judge, fit and able to end all doubts and debates emergent in matters of Religion; but that there muſt be ſome external, viſible, publique, living Judge, to whom all ſorts of perſons, both learned and unlearned, may without danger of error have recourſe; and in whoſe judgement they may reſt for the interpreting and propounding of Gods Word or Revelation. And this living Judge we will moſt evidently prove to be no other, but that Holy, Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que; Apoſtolique, and Viſible Church, which our Saviour purchaſed with the effuſion of his moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bloud.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. If once therefore it be granted, that the Church is that means which God hath left for deciding all Controverſies in Faith, it manifeſtly will follow, that ſhe muſt be infallible in all her determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whether the matters of themſelves be great or ſmall; becauſe, as we ſaid above, it muſt be agreed on all ſides, that if that means which God hath left to determine Controverſies were not infallible in all things propoſed by it, as truths revealed by Almighty God, it could not ſettle in our minds a firm and infallible belief of any one.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. From this Univerſal Infallibility of God's Church, it followeth, that whoſoever wittingly deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any one Point propoſed by her, as revealed by God, is injurious to his divine Majeſty, as if he could either deceive, or be deceived in what he teſtifieth. The averring whereof, were not a <hi>Fundamental</hi> error, but would overthrow the very foundation of all Fundamental Points, and therefore, without repentance, could not poſſibly ſtand with ſalvation.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Out of theſe grounds we will ſhew, that although the diſtinction of Points <hi>Fundamental,</hi> and not <hi>Fundamental</hi> be good and uſeful, as it is delivered and applyed by Catholique Divines, to teach what principal Articles of faith, Chriſtians are obliged <hi>explicitely</hi> to believe: yet that it is impertinent to the preſent purpoſe of excuſing any man from grievous ſin, who knowingly <hi>disbelieves,</hi> that is, believes the contrary of that which God's Church propoſeth as Divine Truth. For it is one thing not to know expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely ſomething teſtified by God, and another poſitively to oppoſe what we know he hath teſtified. The former may often be excuſed from ſin, but never the latter, which only is the caſe in Queſtion.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. In the ſame manner ſhall be demonſtrated, that to alleadge the <hi>Creed,</hi> as containing all Articles of Faith, neceſſary to be explicitely believed, is not pertinent to free from ſin, the voluntary denial of any other Point known to be defined by God's Church. And this were ſufficient to overthrow all that D. <hi>Potter</hi> alleadgeth concerning the <hi>Creed:</hi> though yet, by way of Supererogation, we will prove, that there are divers important matters of Faith which are not mentioned at all in the Creed.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. From the aforeſaid main Principle, that God hath alwayes had, and alwayes will have on earth, a Church <hi>Viſible,</hi> within whoſe Communion Salvation muſt be hoped; and <hi>infallible,</hi> whoſe definitions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64345:29"/>we ought to believe; we will prove, that <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and all other, who continue the diviſion in Communion, or Faith, from that Viſible Church, which at, and before, <hi>Luther</hi>'s appearance was ſpread over the world, cannot be excuſed from <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Hereſie,</hi> although they oppoſed her Faith but in <hi>one only</hi> Point; whereas it is manifeſt, they diſſent from her in <hi>many</hi> and weighty matters, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning as well <hi>belief,</hi> as practice.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. To theſe reaſons drawn from the vertue of <hi>Faith,</hi> we will add one other taken from <hi>Charitas propria,</hi> the Vertue of <hi>Charity,</hi> as it obligeth us, not to expoſe our ſoul to hazard of perdition, when we can put our ſelves in a way much more ſecure, as we will prove that of the Roman Catholiques to be.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. We are then to prove theſe points: Firſt, that the infallible means to determine controverſies in matters of Faith, is the viſible Church of Chriſt. Secondly, that the diſtinction of Points <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> and <hi>not-Fundamental,</hi> maketh nothing to our preſent Queſtion. Thirdly, that, to ſay the <hi>Creed</hi> contains all Fundamental Points of Faith, is neither <hi>pertinent nor true.</hi> Fourthly, that both <hi>Luther,</hi> and all they who, after him, perſiſt in diviſion from the <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> of the Roman Church, cannot be excuſed from <hi>Schiſm.</hi> Fifthly, nor from Hereſie. Sixthly and laſtly, that in regard of the precept of <hi>Charity</hi> towards one's ſelf, Proteſtants be in ſtate of ſin, as long as they remain divided from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church. And theſe ſix Points, ſhall be ſeveral Arguments for ſo many enſuing Chapters.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Only I will here obſerve, that it ſeemeth very ſtrange that Proteſtants ſhould charge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Out of which ground they muſt be enforced to let all our former Inferences paſs for Good. For, is it not a grievous ſin, to deny any one truth contained in Holy Writ? Is there in ſuch denial, any diſtinction between Points Fundamental, and not-Fundamental, ſufficient to excuſe from Hereſie? Is it not impertinent, to alledge the Creed containing all Fundamental Points of Faith, as if, believing it alone, we were at liberty to deny all other Points of Scripture? In a word: Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Proteſtants; Oppoſe not Scripture, there is no Error againſt Faith; Oppoſe it in any leaſt Point, the Error (if Scripture be ſufficiently propoſed, which propoſition is alſo required before a man can be obliged to believe even Fundamental Points) muſt be damnable. What is this, but to ſay with us, <hi>Of Perſons contrary in whatſoever Point of belief, one party only can be ſaved?</hi> And D. <hi>Potter</hi> muſt not take it ill, if Catholiques believe they may be ſaved in that Religion for which they ſuffer. And if by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this doctrine, men will ſtill be charging us with <hi>Want of Charity,</hi> and be reſolved to <hi>take</hi> ſcandal where none is <hi>given;</hi> we muſt comfort our ſelves with that grave and true ſaying of S. <hi>Gregory: If ſcandal</hi>

                        <hi>be taken from declaring a truth, it is better to permit ſcandal, than forſake the truth.</hi> But the ſolid grounds of our Aſſertion, and the ſincerity of our intention in uttering what we think, yields us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, that all will hold for moſt reaſonable the ſaying of Pope <hi>Gelaſius</hi> to <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> the Emperor: <hi>Far be it from the Roman Emperour that he ſhould hold it for a wrong, to have truth declared to him!</hi> Let us therefore begin with that Point which is the firſt that can be controverted betwixt Proteſtants, and us, for as much as concerns the preſent Queſtion, &amp; is contained in the Argument of the next enſuing Chap.</p>

D. <hi>Potter</hi> is charged with malice and indiſcretion, for <hi>being uncharitable to you, while he is accuſing you of uncharitableneſs.</hi> Verily, a great fault, and folly, if the accuſation be juſt; if unjuſt, a great Calumny. Let us ſee then how you make good your charge. The effect of your diſcourſe, if I miſtake not, is this: D. <hi>Potter chargeth the Roman Church with many and great Errors; judgeth reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her Doctrine and ours, impoſsible; and that for them who are convicted in Conſcience of her Errors, not to forſake her in them, or to be reconciled unto her, is damnable: Therefore, if Romane Catholiques be convicted in Conſcience of the Errors of Proteſtants, they may and muſt judge a reconciliation with them damnable; and conſequently to judge ſo, is no more uncharitable in them, than it is in the Doctor to judge as he doth.</hi> All this I grant; nor would any Proteſtant accuſe you of <hi>want of Charity,</hi> if you went no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: if you judged the Religion of Proteſtants damnable to them only who profeſs it, being convicted in conſcience that it is erroneous. For, <hi>if
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64345:30"/>a man judge ſome act of vertue to be a ſin, in him it is a ſin indeed:</hi> So you have taught us, p. 19. So if you be convinced, or rather, to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, perſwaded in conſcience, that our Religion is erroneous, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of it, though it ſelf moſt true, to you would be damnable. This therefore I ſubſcribe very willingly, and withall, that if you ſaid no more, D. <hi>Potter</hi> and my ſelf ſhould be not to Papiſts only, but even to Proteſtants, as uncharitable as you are. For I ſhall always profeſs and glory in this uncharitableneſs of judging <hi>hypocriſie a damnable ſin.</hi> Let Hypocrites then and Diſſemblers on both ſides paſs. It is not towards them, but good Chriſtians; not to Proteſtant Profeſſors, but Believers, that we require your Charity. What think you of thoſe that believe ſo verily the truth of our Religion, that they are reſolved to die in it, and, if occaſion were, to die for it? What Charity have you for them? What think ye of thoſe that, in the daies of our Fathers, laid down their lives for it? Are you content that they ſhall be ſaved, or do you hope they may be ſo? Will you grant, that, notwithſtanding their Errors, there is good hope they might die with repentance? and, if they did ſo, certainly they are ſaved? If you will do ſo, this Controverſie is ended. No man will hereafter charge you with <hi>want of Charity.</hi> This is as much as either we give you, or expect of you, while you remain in your Religion. But then you muſt leave abuſing ſilly people, with telling them (as your faſhion is) that <hi>Proteſtants confeſs, Papiſts may be ſaved, but Papiſts confeſs not ſo much of Proteſtants; therefore yours is the ſafer way, and in Wiſdom and Charity to our own ſouls we are bound to follow it.</hi> For, granting this, you grant as much hope of ſalvation to Proteſtants, as Proteſtants do to you. If you will not, but will ſtill affirm, as <hi>Charity Miſtaken</hi> doth, that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> not diſſemblers, but believers, <hi>without a particular repentance of their Religion cannot be ſaved:</hi> This, I ſay, is a <hi>want of Charity,</hi> into the ſociety whereof D. <hi>Potter</hi> cannot be drawn but with palpable and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent <hi>Sophiſtry.</hi> For, I pray Sir, what dependance is there between theſe Propoſitions: We that hold Proteſtant Religion falſe ſhould be damned if we ſhould profeſs it, Therefore they alſo ſhall be damned, that hold it true? Juſt as if you ſhould conclude, <hi>Becauſe he that doubts is damned if he eat,</hi> Therefore he that doth not doubt, is damned alſo if he eat. And therefore though your Religion to us, and ours to you, if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed againſt Conſcience, would be damnable; yet may it well be uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable to define it ſhall be ſo, to them that profeſs either this or that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Conſcience. This recrimination therefore upon D. <hi>Potter</hi> wherewith you begin, is a plain Fallacy: And, I fear, your proceedings will be anſwerable to theſe beginnings!</p>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64345:31"/>of the truth of your Religion, and the falſhood of their own, and yet dye in it without Contrition.</hi> Which Doctrine if you would ſtand to; and not pull down, and pull back with one hand, what you give and build with the other, this Controverſie were ended; and I ſhould willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that which follows in your fourth Paragraph, <hi>That you allow Proteſtants as much Charity as D.</hi> Potter <hi>allows you.</hi> But then I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to alter the <hi>argument of this Chapter,</hi> and not to go about to give us reaſons, <hi>why, amongſt men of different Religions, one ſide only can be ſaved abſolutely,</hi> which your Reaſons drive at: But you muſt temper the crudeneſs of your Aſſertion, by ſaying, <hi>One ſide only can be ſaved, unleſs want of Conviction, or elſe Repentance, excuſe the other.</hi> Beſides, you muſt not only abſtain from damning any Proteſtant in particular, but, from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming in general, that <hi>Proteſtants dying in their Religion cannot be ſaved;</hi> for you muſt always remember to add this Caution, unleſs <hi>they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſably Ignorant of the falſhood of it, or died with Contrition.</hi> And then, conſidering that you cannot know, whether or no, all things conſidered, they were convinced ſufficiently of the truth of your Religion, and the falſhood of their own, you are obliged by Charity to judge the beſt, and hope they are not. Conſidering again, that, notwithſtanding their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; they may die with Contrition, and that it is no way improbable that they do ſo, and the contrary you cannot be certain of, You are bound in Charity to judge and hope they do ſo. Conſidering thirdly and laſtly, that if they die not with <hi>Contrition,</hi> yet it is very probable they may die with <hi>Attrition,</hi> and that this pretence of yours, that <hi>Contrition will ſerve with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out actual Confeſsion, but Attrition will not,</hi> is but a nicety or fancy, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to give it the true name, a Device of your own, to ſerve ends and purpoſes; God having no where declared himſelf, but that whereſoever he will accept of that Repentance, which you are pleaſed to call <hi>Contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> he will accept of that which you call <hi>Attrition;</hi> For, though he like beſt the bright flaming holocauſt of Love, yet he rejects not, he quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, the ſmoaking flax of that Repentance (if it be true and effectual) which proceeds from hope and fear: Theſe things, I ſay, conſidered (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you will have the Charity of your Doctrine riſe up in judgement againſt your uncharitable Practice) you muſt not only not be peremptorie, in damning Proteſtants, but you muſt hope well of their Salvation: and, out of this hope, you muſt do for them as well as others, thoſe, as you conceive, Charitable Offices, of Praying, giving Alms, and offering Sacrifice, which uſually you do, for thoſe of whoſe Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you are well and charitably perſwaded; (for, I believe, you will never conceive ſo well of Proteſtants, as to aſſure your ſelves they go directly to heaven.) Theſe things when you do, I ſhall believe you think as charitably as you ſpeak. But until then, as he ſaid in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, <hi>Quid verba audiam, cum facta<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> videam?</hi> ſo may I ſay to you, <hi>Quid verba audiam, cum facta non videam?</hi> To what purpoſe ſhould you give us charitable words, which preſently you retract again, by denying us your charitable actions? And, as theſe things you muſt do, if you will ſtand to and make good this pretended Charity, ſo muſt I tell you again and again, that one thing you muſt not do; I mean, You muſt not affright poor people out of their Religion, with telling them, that, <hi>by the confeſsion of both ſides, your way is ſafe, but, in your judgement, ours
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64345:31"/>undoubtedly damnable.</hi> Seeing neither you deny Salvation to <hi>Proteſtants dying with repentance,</hi> nor we promiſe it to you, <hi>if ye die without it.</hi> For, to deal plainly with you, I know no Proteſtant that hath any other hope of your Salvation, but upon theſe grounds, that <hi>unaffected ignorance</hi> may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe you, or <hi>true repentance</hi> obtain pardon for you; neither do the heavy cenſures, which Proteſtants (you ſay) paſs upon your errors, any way hinder, but they may hope as well of you, upon Repentance, as I do. For the <hi>fierce Doctrine,</hi> which, God knows who, teacheth, that <hi>Chriſt for many Ages before</hi> Luther <hi>had no viſible Church upon earth;</hi> will be mild enough, if you conceive them to mean (as perhaps they do) by <hi>no viſible Church, none pure and free from corruptions,</hi> which in your judgement is all one with no Church. But the truth is, the <hi>corruption</hi> of the Church, and the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of it, is not all one. For, if a particular Man or Church may (as you confeſs they may) hold ſome particular Errors, and yet be a Member of the Church Univerſal; why may not the Church hold ſome Univerſal Error, and yet be ſtill the Church? eſpecially ſeeing, you ſay, it is nothing but <hi>oppoſing the Doctrine of the Church that makes an Error dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,</hi> and it is impoſſible, that the Church ſhould oppoſe the Church, I mean, that the preſent Church ſhould oppoſe it ſelf. And then for the Engliſh Proteſtants, though they cenſure your Errors deeply, yet, by your favour, with their deepeſt cenſures it may well conſiſt, that <hi>invincible ignorance</hi> may excuſe you from damnation for them. For you your ſelf confeſs, <hi>That Ignorance may excuſe Errors, even in Fundamental Articles of Faith: ſo that a man ſo erring ſhall not offend at all in ſuch his ignorance or error:</hi> they are your own words, <hi>Pref.</hi> §. 22. And again, with their heavieſt cenſures it may well conſiſt, that your Errors, though in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves damnable, yet may prove <hi>not-damning to you,</hi> if you die with true repentance, for all your ſins known and unknown.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Thus much Charity therefore, if you ſtand to what you have ſaid, is interchangeably granted by each Side to the other, that Neither Religion is ſo fatally <hi>deſtructive, but that by Ignorance or Repentance Salvation may be had on both Sides:</hi> though with a difference that keeps Papiſts ſtill on the more uncharitable ſide. For whereas we conceive a lower degree of Repentance (that which they call <hi>Attrition</hi>) if it be true, and effectual, and convert the heart of the penitent, will ſerve in them: They pretend (even <hi>this Author</hi> which is moſt charitable towards us) that <hi>without Contrition</hi> there is no hope for us. But, though Proteſtants may not obtain this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe at ſo eaſie a rate as Papiſts; yet (even Papiſts being Judges) they may obtain it: and, though there is no entrance for them but at the only door of <hi>Contrition,</hi> yet they may enter; Heaven is not inacceſſible to them. Their errors are no ſuch impenetrable Iſthmus's between them and Salvation, but that <hi>Contrition</hi> may make away through them. All their Schiſm and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie is no ſuch fatal poiſon, but that, if a man joyn with it the Antidote of a general Repentance, he may die in it, and live for ever. Thus much then being acknowledged, I appeal to any indifferent Reader, whether C. M. be not by his <hi>Hyperaſpiſt</hi> forſaken in the plain field, and the Point in queſtion granted to D. <hi>Potter,</hi> viz. <hi>That Proteſtancy, even without a particular Repentance, is not deſtructive of Salvation.</hi> So that all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie remaining now, is, not ſimply <hi>Whether Proteſtancy unrepented deſtroys Salvation?</hi> as it was at firſt propoſed, but, <hi>Whether Proteſtancy
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64345:32"/>in it ſelf</hi> (that is, <hi>abſtracted from Ignorance and Contrition</hi>) <hi>deſtroys Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</hi> So that, as a fooliſh fellow, who gave a Knight the Lye, deſiring withall leave of him to ſet his Knighthood aſide, was anſwered by him, that he would not ſuffer any thing to be ſet aſide that belonged unto him: So might we juſtly take it amiſs, that, conceiving as you do, Ignorance and Repentance ſuch neceſſary things for us, you are not more willing to conſider us with them, than without them. For my part, ſuch is my Charity to you, that conſidering what great neceſſity <hi>You</hi> have, as much as any <hi>Chriſtian Society in the World,</hi> that theſe Sanctuaries of <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> ſhould always ſtand open, I can very hardly perſwade my ſelf ſo much as in my moſt ſecret conſideration to deveſt you of theſe ſo needful qualifications: But whenſoever your errors, ſuperſtitions, and impieties come into my mind, (and, beſides the general bonds of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Chriſtianity, my own particular Obligations to many of you, ſuch and ſo great, that you cannot periſh without a part of my Self,) my only comfort is, amidſt theſe Agonies, that the Doctrine and Practice too of Repentance, is yet remaining in your Church: And that, though you put on a face of confidence of your innocence in point of Doctrine, yet you will be glad to ſtand in the eye of Mercy as well as your fellows, and not be ſo ſtout, as to refuſe either God's pardon or the King's.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. But for the preſent, Proteſtancy is called to the bar, and though not ſentenced by you to death without Mercy, yet arraigned of ſo much natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral malignity, (if not corrected by <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>contrition</hi>) as to be <hi>in it ſelf deſtructive of Salvation.</hi> Which Controverſie I am content to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with you, tying my ſelf to follow the Rules preſcribed by you in your <hi>Preface.</hi> Only I am to remember you, that the adding of this limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <hi>(in it ſelf)</hi> hath made this a new Queſtion; and that this is not the Concluſion, for which you were charged with <hi>want of Charity.</hi> But that, whereas, according to the grounds of your own Religion, <hi>Proteſtants may die in their ſuppoſed errors, either with excuſable ignorance, or with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, and if they do ſo, may be ſaved,</hi> you ſtill are peremptory in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing them damned. Which Poſition, ſuppoſing your Doctrine true, and ours falſe, as it is far from <hi>Charity,</hi> (whoſe eſſential Character it is, <hi>to judge and hope the beſt</hi>), ſo I believe that I ſhall clearly evince this new, but more moderate, Aſſertion of yours to be far from verity, and that it is <hi>Popery, and not Proteſtancy, which in it ſelf deſtroys Salvation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">7. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. In your gradation I ſhall riſe ſo far with you as to grant, <hi>That Chriſt founded a viſible Church, ſtored with all helps neceſſary to Salvation, particularly with ſufficient means to beget and conſerve Faith, to maintain Unity, and compoſe Schiſms, to diſcover and condemn Hereſies, and to determine all Controverſies in Religion,</hi> which were neceſſary to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. For all theſe purpoſes, he gave at the beginning (as we may ſee in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians</hi>) <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors, and Doctors:</hi> who by word of mouth taught their Contemporaries, and by writings (wrot indeed by ſome, but approved by all of them) taught their Chriſtian poſterity to the world's end, how all theſe ends, and that which is the End of all theſe ends, Salvation, is to be atchieved. And theſe means the Providence of God hath ſtill preſerved, and ſo preſerved, that they are ſufficient for all theſe intents. I ſay, <hi>ſufficient,</hi> though, through
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64345:32"/>the malice of men, not always <hi>effectual;</hi> for, that the ſame means may be Sufficient for the compaſſing an end, and not Effectual, you muſt not deny, who hold, that <hi>God gives to all men ſufficient means of Salvation, and yet that all are not ſaved.</hi> I ſaid alſo, Sufficient to determine all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, which were <hi>neceſſary to be determined.</hi> For, if ſome Controverſies may for many Ages be undetermined, and yet in the mean-while men be ſaved; why ſhould, or how can the Churche's being furniſht with ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means to determine <hi>all Controverſies in Religion,</hi> be neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; the end it ſelf, to which theſe means are ordained, being, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſhews, not neceſſary? Plain ſenſe will teach every man, that the neceſſity of the means muſt always be meaſured by, and can never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, the neceſſity of the end. As, if eating be neceſſary, only that I may live; then certainly if I have no neceſſity to live, I have no neceſſity to eat. If I have no need to be at <hi>London,</hi> I have no need of a horſe to carry me thither. If I have no need to fly, I have no need of wings. Anſwer me then I pray directly, and categorically, Is it neceſſary that all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in Religion ſhould be determined? or, is it not? If it be, Why is the the Queſtion of <hi>Predetermination,</hi> of the <hi>immaculate Conception,</hi> of the <hi>Pope's indirect power in Temporalties,</hi> ſo long undetermined? If not, What is it but hypocriſie to pretend ſuch great neceſſity of ſuch effectual means, for the atchieving that end, which is it ſelf not neceſſary? Chriſtians therefore have and ſhall have <hi>means ſufficient</hi> (though not always effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al) <hi>to determine,</hi> not all <hi>Controverſies,</hi> but all <hi>neceſſary to be determined.</hi> I proceed on farther with you, and grant that this means to decide Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies in Faith and Religion, muſt be endued with an Univerſal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility in whatſoever it propoundeth for a divine Truth. For, if it may be falſe in any one thing of this nature, in anything which God requires men to believe, we can yield unto it but a wavering and fearful aſſent in any thing. Theſe Grounds therefore I grant very readily, and give you free leave to make your beſt advantage of them. And yet, to deal tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I do not perceive how from the denial of any of them it would follow that Faith is Opinion: or, from the granting them, that it is not ſo. But for for my part whatſoever clamour you have raiſed againſt me, I think no otherwiſe of the Nature of Faith, I mean, <hi>Hiſtorical Faith,</hi> than generally both Proteſtants and Papiſts do; for, I conceive it <hi>an aſſent to divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations upon the Authority of the Revealer.</hi> Which though in many things it differ from Opinion, (as commonly the word <hi>opinion</hi> is underſtood) yet in ſome things, I doubt not but you will confeſs, that it agrees with it. As firſt, that as Opinion is an Aſſent, ſo is Faith alſo. Secondly, that as Opinion, ſo Faith, is always built upon leſs evidence than that of Senſe or Science. Which Aſſertion you not only grant, but mainly contend for in your <hi>ſixth Chapter.</hi> Thirdly and laſtly, that, as Opinion, ſo Faith admit degrees; and that, as there may be a ſtrong and weak Opinion, ſo there may be a ſtrong and weak Faith. Theſe things if you will grant (as ſure if you be in your right mind you will not deny any of them) I am well contented that this ill-ſounding word, <hi>Opinion,</hi> ſhould be diſcarded, and that among the Intellectual habits you ſhould ſeek out ſome other <hi>Genus</hi> for <hi>Faith.</hi> For I will never contend with any man about words, who grants my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. <hi>But though the eſſence of Faith exclude not all weakneſs and imperfection,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64345:33"/>yet may it be enquired, Whether any certainty of Faith, under the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, may be ſufficient to pleaſe God and attain Salvation?</hi> Whereunto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That though Men are unreaſonable, God requires not any thing but Reaſon. They will not be pleaſed without a down-weight, but God is contented if the ſcale be turned. They pretend, that heavenly things can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeen to any purpoſe, but by the mid-day light: But God will be ſatisfied, if we receive any degree of light which makes us leave the <hi>works of darkneſs, and walk as children of the light.</hi> They exact a certainty of Faith above that of ſenſe or ſcience; God deſires only that we believe the Concluſion, as much as the Premiſſes deſerve; that the ſtrength of our Faith be equal or proportionable to the credibility of the Motives to it. Now though I have, and ought to have, an abſolute certainty of this Theſis, <hi>All which God reveals for truth, is true,</hi> being a Propoſition, that may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, or rather ſo evident to any one that underſtands it, that it needs it not; Yet of this Hypotheſis, <hi>That all the Articles of our Faith were revealed by God,</hi> we cannot ordinarily have any rational and acquired cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, more than moral, founded upon theſe Conſiderations: Firſt, that the goodneſs of the precepts of Chriſtianity, and the greatneſs of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of it, ſhews it, of all other Religions, moſt likely to come from the Fountain of goodneſs. And then that a conſtant, famous, and very ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Tradition, ſo credible that no wiſe man doubts of any other which hath but the fortieth part of the credibility of this; ſuch and ſo credible a Tradition, tells us, that God himſelf hath ſet his Hand and Seal to the truth of this Doctrine, by doing great, and glorious, and frequent Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in confirmation of it. Now our Faith is an aſſent to this Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>the doctrine of Chriſtianity is true,</hi> which being deduced from the former <hi>Theſis,</hi> which is Metaphyſically certain, and from the former <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi> whereof we can have but a Moral certainty, we cannot poſſibly by natural means be more certain of it than of the weaker of the Premiſſes; as a River will not riſe higher than the fountain from which it flows. For the Concluſion always follows the worſer part, if there be any worſe: and muſt be Negative, particular, Contingent, or but Morally certain, if any of the Propoſitions, from whence it is derived, be ſo: Neither can we be certain of it in the higheſt degree, unleſs we be thus certain of all the Principles whereon it is grounded. As a man cannot go or ſtand ſtrongly, if either of his legs be weak. Or as a building cannot be ſtable, if any one of the neceſſary pillars thereof be infirm and inſtable. Or as, If a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage be brought me, from a man of abſolute credit with me, but by a meſſenger that is not ſo, my confidence of the Truth of the Relation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be rebated and leſſened, by my diffidence in the Relatour.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Yet all this I ſay not, as if I doubted, that the Spirit of God, being implored by devout and humble prayer, and ſincere obedience, may, and will by degrees, advance his ſervants higher, and give them a certainty of adherence, beyond their certainty of evidence. But, what God gives as a reward to believers, is one thing; and what he requires of all men, as their duty, is another; and what he will accept of, out of grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, is yet another. To thoſe that believe, and live according to their faith, he gives by degrees the <hi>ſpirit of obſignation and confirmation,</hi> which makes them know (though how they know not) what they did but believe: And to be as fully and reſolutely aſſured of the Goſpel of Chriſt, as thoſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64345:33"/>which heard it from Chriſt himſelf with their ears, which ſaw it with their eyes, which looked upon it, and whoſe hands handled the Word of Life. He requires of all, that their Faith ſhould be (as I have ſaid) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the Motives and Reaſons enforcing to it; he will accept of the weakeſt and loweſt degree of Faith, if it be living and effectual unto true Obedience. For he it is that <hi>will not quench the ſmoaking flax, nor break the bruiſed Reed.</hi> He did not reject the prayer of that diſtreſſed man that cryed unto him, <hi>Lord, I believe; Lord, help mine unbelief.</hi> He commands us to <hi>receive them that are weak in faith,</hi> and thereby declares that he receives them. And as nothing avails with him, but Faith <hi>which worketh by love:</hi> So any Faith, if it be but as a <hi>grain of muſtard-ſeed,</hi> if it <hi>work by love,</hi> ſhall certainly avail with him, and be accepted of him. Some experience makes me fear, that the faith of conſidering and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing men, is like to be crackt with too much ſtraining: And that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſſeſſed with this <hi>falſe</hi> Principle, that it is in vain to believe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt, with ſuch a kind or degree of aſſent, as they yield to other matters of Tradition: And finding that their faith of it, is to them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcernable, from the belief they give to the truth of other Stories; are in danger either not to believe at all, thinking, not at all as good as to no purpoſe; or elſe, though indeed they do believe it, yet to think they do not, and to caſt themſelves into wretched agonies and perplexities, as fearing they have not that, without which it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, and obtain eternal happineſs. Conſideration of this advantage, which the Devil probably may make of this Fancy, made me willing to inſiſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what largely upon the Refutation of it.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. I return now thither from whence I have digreſſed, and aſſure you, concerning the grounds afore-laid, which were, that there is a <hi>Rule of Faith whereby Controverſies may be decided, which are neceſſary to be deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;</hi> and that <hi>this Rule is univerſally infallible,</hi> That notwithſtanding any opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I hold, touching Faith or any thing elſe, I may, and do believe them, as firmly as you pretend to do. And therefore you may build on, in God's name; for by God's help, I ſhall always embrace, whatſoever ſtructure is naturally and rationally laid upon them whatſoever concluſion, may to my underſtanding be evidently deduced from them. You ſay, out of them it undeniably follows, <hi>That, of two diſagreeing in matter of Faith, the one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved, but by repentance or ignorance.</hi> I anſwer, by diſtinction of thoſe terms, <hi>two diſſenting in a matter of faith.</hi> For it may be either in a thing which is indeed a <hi>matter of Faith,</hi> in the ſtricteſt ſenſe; that is, ſomething, the Belief whereof God requires under pain of damnation: And ſo the Concluſion is true, though the Conſequence of it from your former premiſſes either is none at all, or ſo obſcure, that I can hardly diſcern it. Or it may be, as it often falls out concerning a thing which being indeed <hi>no matter of Faith, is yet overvalued</hi> by the parties at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, and eſteemed to be ſo. And in this ſenſe it is neither conſequent, nor true. The untruth of it I have already declared in my examination of your Preface. The inconſequence of it, is of itſelf evident; for, Who ever heard of a wilder Collection than this—</p>
                        <p>God hath provided means ſufficient to decide all Controverſies in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, neceſſary to be decided;</p>
                        <p>This means is univerſally infallible;</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="34" facs="tcp:64345:34"/>
Therefore of two, that differ in any thing which they eſteem a matter of Faith, one cannot be ſaved.</p>
                        <p>He that can find any connection between theſe Propoſitions, I believe will be able to find good coherence between the deaf Plaintiff's Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the Greek Epigram, and the deaf Defendant's Anſwer, and the deaf Judge's Sentence: And to contrive them all into a formal Categorical Syllogiſm.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. Indeed, if the matter in agitation were plainly decided, by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible means of deciding Controverſies, and the Parties in variance knew it to be ſo, and yet would ſtand out in their diſſention: this were, in one of them, direct oppoſition to the Teſtimony of God, and undoubtedly a damnable ſin. But, if you take the liberty to ſuppoſe what you pleaſe, you may very eaſily conclude what you liſt. For, who is ſo fooliſh as to grant you theſe unreaſonable Poſtulates, that every emergent Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of Faith is plainly decided by the means of deciſion which God hath appointed; and that, of the parties litigant, one is always ſuch a convicted Recuſant as you pretend? Certainly, if you ſay ſo, having no better warrant than you have, or can have for it, this is more proper and formal uncharitableneſs, than ever was charged upon you. Me-thinks, with much more Reaſon, and much more Charity, you might ſuppoſe, that many of theſe Controverſies, which are now diſputed among Chriſtians (all which profeſs themſelves lovers of Chriſt, and truly deſirous to know his will and do it) are either <hi>not decidable</hi> by that means which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and ſo not neceſſary to be decided: or, if they be, yet <hi>not ſo plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and evidently,</hi> as to oblige all men to hold one way: or Laſtly, if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidable, and evidently decided, yet you may hope that the erring party, by reaſon of ſome veil before his eyes, <hi>ſome excuſable ignorance or unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable prejudice,</hi> doth not ſee the Queſtion to be decided againſt him, and ſo oppoſeth not that which He doth know to be the Word of God, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which You know to be ſo, and which he might know, were he void of prejudice. Which is a fault I confeſs, but a fault, which is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent even to good and honeſt men very often: and not of ſuch a gigantique diſpoſition, as you make it, to fly directly upon God Almighty, and to give him the Lye to his face.</p>

                        <p>To all theſe Aſſertions I will content my ſelf for the preſent to oppoſe this one, <hi>That not one of them all is true.</hi> Only I may not omit to tell you,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64345:34"/>that if the firſt of them were as true as the Pope himſelf deſires it ſhould be, yet the Corollary, which you deduce from it, would be utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, That, <hi>Whoſoever denies any Point propoſed by the Church, is inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to God's Divine Majeſty; as if He could deceive, or be deceived.</hi> For though your Church were indeed as <hi>Infallible a Propounder of Divine Truths</hi> as it pretends to be, yet, if it appeared not to me to be ſo, I might very well believe God moſt true, and your Church moſt falſe. As, though the Goſpel of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> be the Word of God; yet, if I neither knew it to be ſo, nor believed it, I might believe in God, and yet think that Goſpel a Fable. Hereafter therefore I muſt entreat you to remember, that our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of this impiety, depends not only upon your being, but upon our knowing that you are ſo. Neither muſt you argue thus; <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is the Infallible Propounder of Divine Verities, therefore he that oppoſeth Her, calls God's Truth in Queſtion:</hi> But thus rather, <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is ſo, and Proteſtants know it to be ſo; therefore in oppoſing her, they impute to God, that either he deceives them, or is deceived himſelf.</hi> For as I may deny ſomething which you upon your knowledge have affirmed, and yet never diſparage your honeſty, if I never knew that you affirmed it: So I may be undoubtedly certain of God's Omniſcience, and Veracity, and yet doubt of ſomething which he hath revealed; provided, I do not know, nor believe that he hath revealed it. So, that though your Church be the appointed witneſs of God's Revelations, yet until you know, that we know ſhe is ſo, you cannot without foul calumny impute to us, That <hi>we charge God blaſphemouſly with deceiving, or being deceived.</hi> You will ſay perhaps, That this is directly conſequent from our Doctrine, <hi>That the Church may err,</hi> which is directed by God in all her Propoſals. True, if we knew it to be directed by him, otherwiſe not; much leſs if we believe, and know the contrary. But then, if it were conſequent from our Opinion, have you ſo little Charity, as to ſay, that men are <hi>juſtly chargeable with all the conſequences of their Opinions;</hi> Such Conſequences, I mean, as they do not own, but diſclaim; and, if there were a neceſſity of doing either, would much rather forſake their Opinion, than imbrace thoſe Conſequences? What opinion is there that draws after it ſuch a train of <hi>portentous blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> as that of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> by the judgement of the beſt Writers of your own <hi>Order?</hi> And will you ſay now, that the <hi>Dominicans</hi> are juſtly chargeable with all thoſe Blaſphemies? If not, ſeeing our caſe (take it at the worſt) is but the ſame, why ſhould not your judgment of us be the ſame? I appeal to all thoſe Proteſtants that have gone over to your Side; whether when they were moſt averſe from it, they did ever deny or doubt of <hi>God's Omniſcience or Veracity;</hi> whether they did ever believe, or were taught, that <hi>God did deceive them, or was deceived himſelf.</hi> Nay, I provoke to you your ſelf, and deſire you to deal truly, and to tell Us whether you do in your heart believe, that we do indeed not believe the eternal Veracity of the eternal Verity? And, if you judge ſo ſtrangely of us, having no better ground for it, than you have or can have, we ſhall not need any farther proof of your uncharitableneſs towards us, this being the extremity of true uncharitableneſs. If not, then, I hope, having no other ground but this (which ſure is none at all) to pronounce us <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Heretiques,</hi> you will ceaſe to do ſo; and hereafter (as, if your ground be true, you may do with more Truth and Charity) collect thus,

                           <hi>They only err damnably, who oppoſe what they know God hath teſtified;</hi> But, <hi>Proteſtants ſure do not oppoſe what they know God hath teſtified, at leaſt we cannot with Charity ſay they do; Therefore they either do not err damnably, or with Charity we cannot ſay they do ſo.</hi>

                        <p n="13">13. <hi>Ad.</hi> § 17. <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (you ſay) <hi>according to their own grounds muſt hold, that of perſons contrary in whatſoever Point of Belief one part on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can be ſaved, therefore it is ſtrangely done of them to charge Papiſts with want of Charity for holding the ſame.</hi> The Conſequence I acknowledge, but wonder much what it ſhould be that lays upon Proteſtants any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to do ſo! You tell us, it is their holding <hi>Scripture the ſole Rule of Faith:</hi> For this, you ſay, obligeth them to pronounce them damned, that oppoſe any leaſt Point <hi>delivered in Scripture.</hi> This I grant, If they oppoſe it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſufficient declaration, ſo that either they <hi>know it to be contained in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> or have no juſt probable Reaſon, and which may move an honeſt man to doubt, Whether or no it be there contained. For to oppoſe in the firſt caſe, in a man that believes the Scripture to be the Word of God, is, to give God the lye. To oppoſe in the ſecond, is, to be obſtinate againſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and therefore a ſin, though not ſo great as the former. But then this is nothing to the purpoſe of the neceſſity of damning all thoſe that are of contrary belief; and that for theſe Reaſons. Firſt, becauſe the contrary belief may be touching a Point not at all mentioned in Scripture; and ſuch Points, though indeed they be not <hi>matters of Faith,</hi> yet by men in vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance are often over-valued and eſteemed to be ſo. So that, though it were damnable to oppoſe any Point contained in Scripture, yet Perſons of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary belief (as <hi>Victor,</hi> and <hi>Polycrates,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi>) might both be ſaved, becauſe their contrary belief was not touching any Point contained in Scripture. Secondly, becauſe the contrary belief may be about the ſenſe of ſome place of Scripture which is ambiguous, and with probability capable of divers ſenſes; and in ſuch caſes it is no marvel, and ſure no ſin, if ſeveral men go ſeveral ways. Thirdly, becauſe the contrary belief may be concerning Points wherein Scripture may, with ſo great probability, be alledged on both ſides, (which is a ſure note of a Point <hi>not-neceſſary</hi>) that men of honeſt and upright hearts, true lovers of God and of Truth, ſuch as deſire above all things, to know God's will and to do it, may, without any fault at all, ſome go one way, and ſome another, and ſome (and thoſe as good men as either of the former) ſuſpend their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and expect ſome <hi>Elias to ſolve doubts,</hi> and reconcile repugnancies. Now in all ſuch Queſtions, one ſide or other (which ſoever it is) holds that which indeed is oppoſite to the ſenſe of the Scripture, which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; for it is impoſſible that God ſhould intend Contradictions. But then this intended ſenſe is not ſo fully declared, but that they which oppoſe it, may verily believe that they indeed maintain it, and have great ſhew of reaſon to induce them to believe ſo; and therefore are not to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as men oppoſing that which they either know to be a Truth delivered in Scripture, or have no probable Reaſon to believe the contrary; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in Charity to be acquitted and abſolved, as men who endeavour to find the Truth, but fail of it through humane frailty.</p>
                        <p>This ground being laid, the Anſwer to your enſuing Interrogatories, which you conceive impoſſible, is very obvious and eaſie.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. <hi>To the firſt, Whether it be not in any man a grievous ſin to deny any
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64345:35"/>one Truth contained in holy Writ?</hi> I anſwer, Yes, if he knew it to be ſo, or have no probable Reaſon to doubt of it: otherwiſe, not.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. <hi>To the ſecond: Whether there be in ſuch denial any diſtinction between Fundamental and not-Fundamental ſufficient to excuſe from Hereſie?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Yes, There is ſuch a Diſtinction. But the Reaſon is, becauſe thoſe Points, either in themſelves, or by accident, are <hi>Fundamental,</hi> which are <hi>evidently contained in Scripture, to him that knows them to be ſo:</hi> Thoſe not-Fundamental, which are there-hence deducible, but probably only, not evidently.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. <hi>To the third: Whether it be not impertinent to alledge the Creed as containing all Fundamental Points of Faith, as if believing it alone we were at Liberty to deny all other Points of Scripture?</hi> I anſwer, It was never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to any ſuch purpoſe; but only as a ſufficient, or rather more than a ſufficient Summarie of thoſe Points of Faith, which were of neceſſity to be believed actually and explicitly; and that only of ſuch which were meerly and purely <hi>Credenda,</hi> and not <hi>Agenda.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="17">17. <hi>To the fourth,</hi> drawn as a Corollary from the former, <hi>Whether this be not to ſay, that, Of Perſons contrary in belief, one part only can be ſaved?</hi> I anſwer, By no means.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F our eſtimation, reſpect, and reverence to holy Scripture, even Proteſtans themſelves do in fact give teſtimony, while they poſſeſs it from us, and take it upon the integrity of our cuſtody, No cauſe imaginable could avert our will from giving the function of ſupreme and ſole Judge to holy Writ, if both the thing were not impoſſible in it ſelf, and if both reaſon and experience did not convince our underſtanding, that, by this Aſſertion Contentions are increaſed, and not ended. We acknowledge holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to be a moſt perfect Rule, for as much as a Writing can be a Rule: We only deny that it excludes, either divine Tradition, though it be unwritten, or an external Judge to keep, to propoſe, to interpret in a true, Orthodox, and Catholique ſenſe. Every ſingle Book, every Chapter, yea, every period of holy Scripture is infallibly true, and wants no due perfection. But muſt we therefore inferr, that all other Books of Scripture are to be excluded, leſt, by addition of them, we may ſeem to derogate from the perfection of the former? When the firſt Books of the Old and New Teſtament were written, they did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude unwritten Traditions, nor the Authority of the Church to decide Controverſies; and who hath then ſo altered their nature, and filled them with ſuch jealouſies, as that now they cannot agree for fear of mutual diſparagement? What greater wrong is it for the written Word, to be compartner now with the unwritten, than for the unwritten, which was once alone, to be afterward joyned, with the written? Who ever heard, that, to commend the fidelity of a Keeper, were to diſauthorize the thing committed to his cuſtody? Or that, to extol the integrity and knowledge, and to avouch the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Judge in ſuits of Law, were to deny perfection in the Law? Are there not in Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, beſides the Laws, written and unwritten cuſtoms, Judges appointed to declare both the one, and the other, as ſeveral occaſions may require?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the Scripture alone cannot be Judge in Controverſies of Faith, we gather it very clearly, From the quality of a writing in general: From the nature of holy Writ in particular, which muſt be believed as true, and infallible: From the Editions, and Tranſlations of it: From the difficulty to underſtand
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64345:36"/>it without hazard of Error: From the inconveniences that muſt follow upon the aſcribing of ſole Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature to it: and finally, From the Confeſſions of our Adverſaries. And, on the other ſide, all theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties ceaſing, and all other qualities requiſite to a Judge concurring in the viſible Church of Chriſt our Lord, we muſt conclude, that She it is, to whom, in doubts concerning Faith and Religion, all Chriſtians ought to have recourſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The name, notion, nature, and properties of a Judge cannot in common reaſon agree to any meer writing, which, be it otherwiſe in it its kind, never ſo highly qualified with ſanctity and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility; yet it muſt ever be, as all writings are, deaf, dumb, and inanimate. By a Judge, all wiſe men underſtand a perſon endued with life, and reaſon, able to hear, to examine, to declare his mind to the diſagreeing parties, in ſuch ſort as that each one may know whether the ſentence be in favour of his cauſe, or againſt his pretence; and he muſt be applyable, and able to do all this, as the diverſity of Controverſies, Perſons, Occaſions, and Circumſtances may require. There is a great and plain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction betwixt a <hi>Judge</hi> and a <hi>Rule.</hi> For, as in a Kingdom, the Judge hath his Rule to follow, which are the received Laws and Cuſtoms; ſo are not they fit orable to declare, or be Judges to themſelves, but that office muſt belong to a living Judge. The holy Scripture may be, and is, a Rule; but cannot be a Judge, becauſe, it being always the ſame, cannot declare it ſelf any one time, or upon any one occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, more particularly then upon any other; and let it be read over an hundred times, it will be ſtill the ſame, and no more fit alone to terminate Controverſies in Faith, than the Law would be to end ſuits, if it were given over to the fancy, and gloſs of every ſingle man.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. This difference betwixt a Judge and a Rule, D. <hi>Potter</hi> perceived, when, more than once having ſtiled the Scripture a <hi>Judge,</hi> by way of correcting that term, he adds, <hi>or rather a Rule,</hi> becauſe he knew that an inanimate writing could not be a <hi>Judge.</hi> From hence alſo it was, that, though Proteſtants in their beginning affirmed Scripture alone to be the Judge of Controverſies; yet, upon a more adviſed reflection, they changed the phraſe, and ſaid, that not Scripture, but the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking in Scripture, is Judge in Controverſies. A difference without a diſparity. The Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking only in Scripture, is no more intelligible to us, than the Scripture in which he ſpeaks: as a man ſpeaking only Latin, can be no better underſtood, than the tongue wherein he ſpeaketh. And therefore to ſay, A Judge is neceſſary for deciding Controverſies, about the meaning of Scripture, is as much as to ſay, He is neceſſary to decide what the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks in Scripture. And, it were a conceit, equally fooliſh and pernitious, if one ſhould ſeek to take away all Judges in the Kingdom, upon this nicety, that, albeit Laws cannot be Judges, yet the Law-maker ſpeaking in the Law, may perform that Office; as if the Law-maker ſpeaking in the Law, were with more perſpicuity underſtood, than the Law whereby he ſpeaketh.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. But, though ſome writing were granted to have a priviledge, to declare it ſelf upon ſuppoſition that it were maintained in being, and preſerved entire from corruptions; yet it is manifeſt, that no writing can conſerve it ſelf, nor can complain, or denounce the falſifier of it; and therefore it ſtands in need of ſome watchful and not-erring eye, to guard it, by means of whoſe aſſured vigilancy, we may undoubtedly receive it ſincere and pure.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. And, ſuppoſe it could defend it ſelf from corruption, how could it aſſure us that it ſelf were Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical, and of infallible verity? By ſaying ſo? Of this very <hi>Affirmation,</hi> there will remain the ſame Queſtion ſtill; how it can prove it ſelf to be infallibly true? Neither can there ever be an end of the like multiplyed demands, till we reſt in the external Authority of ſome perſon or perſons bearing witneſs to the world, that ſuch, or ſuch a Book is Scripture; and yet upon this Point, according to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, all other Controverſies in Faith depend.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That Scripture cannot aſſure us, that it ſelf is Canonical Scripture, is acknowledged by ſome Proteſtants, in expreſs words; and by all of them, in deeds. M. <hi>Hooker,</hi> whom D. <hi>Potter</hi> ranketh<note n="(a)" place="margin">

Neither could we come to any pauſe whereon to reſt, unleſs, beſides Scripture, there were ſomething which might aſſure us, &amp;c.</hi> And this he acknowledges to be the<note n="(d)" place="margin">L. <hi>3.</hi> Sect. <hi>8.</hi> pag. <hi>1.146.</hi> &amp; alibi.</note> Church.

O godly Reformer of the Roman Church! But to return to our Engliſh Canon of Scripture. In the New Teſtament by the above-mentioned rule <hi>(of whoſe authority was never any doubt in the Church)</hi> divers Books of the New Teſtament muſt be diſ-canonized, to wit, all thoſe of which ſome Ancients have doubted, and thoſe which divers <hi>Lutherans</hi> have of late denied.

If they had deſcended to particulars, they muſt have contradicted ſome of their chiefeſt Brethren. <hi>As they are commonly received,</hi> &amp;c. I ask, By whom? By the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Then, by the ſame reaſon they muſt receive divers Books of the Old Teſtament, which they reject. By <hi>Lutherans?</hi> Then with <hi>Lutherans</hi> they may deny ſome Books of the New Teſtament. If it be the greater, or leſs number of Voices, that muſt cry up or down, the Canon of Scripture, our <hi>Roman</hi> Canon will prevail: and among Proteſtants the <hi>Certainty</hi> of their <hi>Faith</hi> muſt be reduced to an <hi>Uncertain</hi> Controverſie of <hi>Fact,</hi> Whether the number of thoſe who reject, or of thoſe others who receive ſuch and ſuch Scriptures, be greater. Their Faith muſt alter according to years and days. When <hi>Luther</hi> firſt appeared, he, and his Diſciples were the greater number of that new Church; and ſo this claim <hi>(Of being commonly received)</hi> ſtood for them, till <hi>Zuinglius</hi> or <hi>Calvin</hi> grew to ſome equal, or greater number than that of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and then this rule of <hi>(Commonly received)</hi> will canonize their Canon againſt the <hi>Lutherans.</hi> I would gladly know, why, in the former part of their Article, they ſay both of the <hi>Old and New Teſtament: In the name of the holy Scripture, we do underſtand thoſe Canonical Books of the Old and New Teſtament, of whoſe Authority was never any doubt in the Church;</hi> And in the latter part, ſpeaking again of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> they give a far different rule, ſaying, <hi>All the Books of the New Teſtament, as they are commonly received, we do receive, and account them Canonical.</hi> This, I ſay, is a rule much different from the former <hi>(of whoſe Authority was NEVER any doubt in the Church.)</hi> For ſome Books might be ſaid to be <hi>Commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi> although they were <hi>ſometime</hi> doubted of <hi>by ſome.</hi> If to be <hi>Commonly received,</hi> paſs for a good rule to know the Canon of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> why not of the <hi>Old?</hi> Above all we deſire to know, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what infallible ground in ſome Books they agree with us againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> and divers principal <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> and in others jump with <hi>Luther</hi> againſt us? But ſeeing they diſagree among themſelves, it is evident that they have no certain rule to know the Canon of Scripture, in aſſigning whereof ſome of them muſt of neceſſity err; becauſe, of contradictory Propoſitions both cannot be true.</p>

For, ſuppoſe a man had never read, or heard of Sun, Moon, Fire, Candle, &amp;c. and ſhould be brought to behold a light, yet in ſuch ſort as that the Agent, or Cauſe efficient from which it proceeded, were kept hidden from him; could ſuch a one, by only beholding the light, certainly know, Whether it were produced by the Sun, or Moon, &amp;c? Or, if one hear a voice, and had never known the Speaker, could he know from whom in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular that voice proceeded? They, who look upon Scripture, may well ſee, that ſome one wrote it; but that it was written by divine inſpiration, how ſhall they know? Nay, they cannot ſo much as know who wrote it, unleſs they firſt know the Writer, and what hand he writes: as likewiſe I cannot know whoſe voice it is which I hear, unleſs I firſt both know the perſon who ſpeaks, and with what voice he uſeth to ſpeak; and yet, even all this ſuppoſed, I may perhaps be deceived. For there may be Voices ſo like, and Hand ſo counterfeited, that men may be deceived by them, as birds were by the Grapes of that skilful Painter. Now ſince Proteſtants affirm, knowledge concerning God as our <hi>ſupernatural</hi> end, muſt be taken from Scripture, they cannot in Scripture alone diſcern that it is his voice, or writing, becauſe they cannot know from whom a writing, or voice proceeds, unleſs firſt they know the perſon who ſpeaketh, or writeth. Nay, I ſay more, by Scripture alone, they cannot ſo much as know, that any perſon doth in it, or by it, ſpeak any thing at all: becauſe one may write without intent to ſignifie, or affirm any thing, but only to ſet down, or, as it were, paint, ſuch characters, ſyllables, and words; as men are wont to ſet copies, not caring what the ſignification of the words imports: or as one tranſcribes a writing which himſelf underſtands not: or when one writes what another dictates, and in other ſuch caſes, wherein it is clear, that the Writer ſpeaks or ſignifies nothing in ſuch his writing; and therefore by <hi>it</hi> we cannot hear, or underſtand <hi>his</hi> voice. With what certainty then can any man affirm, that by Scripture it ſelf they can ſee, that the Writers did intend to ſignifie any thing at all: that they were Apoſtles, or other Canonical Authors: that they wrote their own ſenſe, and not what was dictated by ſome other man: and finally and eſpecially, that they wrote by the infallible direction of the holy Ghoſt?</p>

But let us be liberal, and for the preſent ſuppoſe (not grant) that Scripture is, like to corporal light, by it ſelf alone able to determine, and move our underſtanding to aſſent; yet the Similitude proves againſt themſelves. For light is not viſible, except to ſuch as have eyes, which are not made by the light, but muſt be preſuppoſed as produced by ſome other cauſe. And therefore, to hold the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Scripture can be clear only to thoſe who are endued with the eye of Faith; or, as D. <hi>Potter</hi> above cited ſaith, to all that <hi>have</hi>

Faith then muſt not originally proceed from Scripture, but is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed, before we can ſee the light thereof; and conſequently there muſt be ſome other means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to Scripture, to beget Faith, which can be no other than the Church.</p>

If they mean, that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is one of thoſe principles, which being the firſt, and the moſt known in all Sciences, cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated by other principles, they ſuppoſe that which is in queſtion, Whether there be not ſome Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, (for example, the Church) whereby we may come to the knowledg of Scripture. If they intend, that Scripture is a Principle, but not the firſt, and moſt known in Chriſtianity, then Scripture may be proved. For Principles, that are not the firſt, nor known of themſelves, may, and ought to be proved, before we can yield aſſent, either to them, or to other verities depending on them. It is repugnant to their own Doctrine, and practice, in as much as they are wont to affirm, that one part of Scripture may be known to be Canonical, and may be interpreted by another. And ſince every Scripture is a Principle ſufficient, upon which to ground divine Faith, they muſt grant, that one Principle may, and ſometime muſt, be proved by another. Yea this their Anſwer, upon due ponderation, fals out to prove, what we affirm. For ſince all Principles cannot be proved, we muſt (that our labour may not be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) come at length, to reſt in ſome Principle, which may not require any other proof.

Salvation cannot be hoped for, without true Faith: Faith, according to them, relies upon Scripture alone: Scripture muſt be delivered to moſt of them, by the Tranſlations: Tranſlations depend on the skill and honeſty of men, in whom nothing is more certain than a moſt certain poſſibility to err, and no greater evidence of truth, than that it is evident ſome of them embrace falſhood, by reaſon of their contrary Tranſlations. What then remaineth, but that Truth, Faith, Salvation, and All, muſt in them rely upon a fallible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain ground?

Moreover, there was no Scripture, or written Word for about two thouſand years from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> whom all acknowledge to have been the firſt Author of Canonical Scripture: And again, for about two thouſand years more, from <hi>Moſes</hi> to Chriſt our Lord, holy Scripture was only among the people of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and yet there were <hi>Gentiles</hi> endued in thoſe dayes with divine Faith, as appeareth in <hi>Job,</hi> and his friends. Wherefore, during ſo many Ages, the Church alone was the Decider of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, and Inſtructor of the faithful. Neither did the Word written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> deprive the Church of her former Infallibility, or other qualities requiſite for a Judge: yea D. <hi>Potter</hi> acknowledgeth, that beſides the <hi>Law,</hi> there was a living <hi>Judge</hi> in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, endued with an <hi>abſolutely infallible direction in caſe of moment;</hi> as all Points belonging to divine Faith are. Now, the Church of Chriſt our Lord, was before the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, which were not written inſtantly, nor all at one time, but ſucceſſively upon ſeveral occaſions; and ſome after the deceaſe of moſt of the Apoſtles: and after they were written, they were not preſently known to all Churches: and of ſome there was doubt in the Church for ſome Ages after our Saviour. Shall we then ſay, that according as the Church by little and little received holy Scripture, ſhe was by the like degrees deveſted of her poſſeſſed Infallibility, and power to decide Controverſies in Religion? That ſometime Churches had one Judge of Controverſies, and others another? That with moneths, or years, as new Canonical Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture grew to be publiſhed, the Church altered her whole Rule of Faith, or Judge of Controverſies? After the Apoſtles time, and after the writing of Scriptures, Hereſies would be ſure to riſe, requiring in God's Church, for their diſcovery and condemnation, <hi>Infallibility,</hi> either to write new Canonical Scripture, as was done in the Apoſtles time by occaſion of emergent Hereſies; or <hi>Infallibility</hi> to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret Scriptures, already written, or without Scripture, by divine unwritten Traditions, and aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt to determine all Controverſies, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith: <hi>The ſoul is</hi>

Muſt the Church wax dry, by giving to her Children the milk of ſacred Writ? No, No. Her Infallibility was, and is, derived from an inexhauſted Fountain. If <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will have the Scripture alone for their Judge, let them firſt produce ſome Scripture affirming, that by the <hi>entring</hi> thereof, Infallibility <hi>went out</hi> of the Church. D. <hi>Potter</hi> may remember what himſelf teacheth; That the Church is ſtill endued with Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility in Points Fundamental; and conſequently, that Infallibility in the Church doth well agree with the truth, the ſanctity, yea with the ſufficiency, of Scripture, for all matters neceſſary to Salvation. I would therefore gladly know, out of what Text he imagineth that the Church by the coming of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, was deprived of Infallibility in ſome Points, and not in others? He affirmeth, that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synagogue retained infallibility in herſelf, notwithſtanding the writing of the <hi>Old</hi> Teſtament; and will he ſo unworthily and unjuſtly deprive the Church of Chriſt of Infallibility by reaſon of the <hi>New</hi> Teſtament?

D. <hi>Potter</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Pag. 24.</note> againſt this argument, drawn from the power and infallibility of the Synagogue, objects, That we might as well inſerr, that <hi>Chriſtians muſt have one Soveraign Prince over all, becauſe the Jews had one chief Judge.</hi> But the diſparity is very clear.

So the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> to eſtabliſh her tyranny over mens conſciences, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not either to aboliſh or corrupt the holy Scriptures, the Pillars and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of Chriſtian liberty (which in regard of the numerous multitude of Copies diſperſed through all places, tranſlated into almoſt all Languages, guarded with all ſollicitous care and induſtry, had been an impoſſible at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;) But the more expedite way, and therefore more likely to be ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſeful, was, to gain the opinion and eſteem of the <hi>publique and authoriz'd Interpreter</hi> of them, and the Authority of adding to them what Doctrin ſhe pleaſed under the title of <hi>Traditions</hi> or <hi>Definitions.</hi> For by this means, ſhe might both ſerve herſelf of all thoſe clauſes of Scripture, which might be drawn to caſt a favourable countenance upon her ambitious pretences, which in caſe the Scripture had been aboliſhed, ſhe could not have done; and yet be ſecure enough of having either her power limited, or her cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and abuſes reformed by them; this being once ſetled in the minds

But to little purpoſe is verbal reverence without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ſubmiſſion and ſyncere obedience; and, as our Saviour ſaid of ſome, ſo the Scripture, could it ſpeak, I believe would ſay to you, <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not that which I command you?</hi> Caſt away the vain and arrogant pretence of <hi>infallibility,</hi> which makes your errors incurable.

3. For, whereas you ſay, <hi>No cauſe imaginable could avert your will, for giving the function of ſupreme and ſole Judge to holy Writ; but that the thing is impoſsible, and that by this means controverſies are increaſed and not ended:</hi> you mean perhaps,—<hi>That you can or will imagine no other cauſe but theſe.</hi> But ſure there is little reaſon you ſhould meaſure other mens imaginations by your own, who perhaps may be ſo clouded and vailed with prejudice, that you cannot, or will not, ſee that which is moſt manifeſt. For what indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and unprejudicate man may not eaſily conceive another cauſe which (I do not ſay does, but certainly) may pervert your wills, and avert your underſtandings from ſubmitting your Religion and Church to a <hi>tryall by Scripture?</hi> I mean the great and apparent and unavoidable danger which by this means you would fall into, of loſing the Opinion which men have of your Infallibility, and conſequently your power and authority over mens conſciences, and all that depends upon it. So that though <hi>Diana of the Epheſians</hi> be cryed up, yet it may be feared that with a great many among you (though I cenſure or judge no man) the other cauſe which wrought upon <hi>Demetrius</hi> and the <hi>Craftsmen,</hi> may have with you alſo the more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, though more ſecret influence: and that is, that <hi>by this craft we have our living;</hi> by this craft, I mean, of keeping your Proſelytes from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different tryal of your Religion by Scripture, and making them yield up and captivate their judgement unto yours. Yet had you only ſaid <hi>de facto,</hi> that no other cauſe did avert your own will from this, but only theſe which you pretend; out of Charity I ſhould have believed you. But ſeeing you ſpeak not of your ſelf, but of all of your Side, whoſe hearts you cannot know; and profeſs not only, That there is no other cauſe, but that <hi>No other is imaginable,</hi> I could not let this paſſe without a cenſure. As for the impoſſibility of Scriptures being the ſole Judge of Controverſies, that is, <hi>the ſole Rule for men to judge them by</hi> (for we mean nothing elſe) you only affirm it without proof, as if the thing were evident of it ſelf. And therefore I, conceiving the contrary to be more evident, might well content my ſelf to deny it without refutation. Yet I cannot but deſire you to tell me, If Scripture cannot be the Judge of any Controverſie, how ſhall that touching the <hi>Church and the Notes of it,</hi> be determined? And if it be the ſole Judge of this one, why may it not of others? Why not of All? Thoſe only excepted wherein the Scripture it ſelf is the ſubject of the Queſtion, which cannot be determined but by natural reaſon, the only principle, beſide Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which is common to Chriſtians.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Then for the Imputation of <hi>increaſing contentions and not ending them,</hi> Scripture is innocent of it; as alſo this opinion, <hi>That controverſies are to be decided by Scripture.</hi> For if men did really and ſincerely ſubmit their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to Scripture, and that only, and would require no more of any man but to do ſo, it were impoſſible but that all Controverſies, touching things neceſſary and very profitable ſhould be ended: and if others were continued or increaſed, it were no matter.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. In the next words we have direct <hi>Boyes-play;</hi> a thing given with one hand, and taken away with the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an acknowledgment made in one line, and retracted in the next. <hi>We acknowledg</hi> (ſay you) <hi>Scripture to be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rule, for as much as a Writing can be a Rule; only we deny that it excludes unwritten Tradition.</hi> As if you ſhould have ſaid, We acknowledg it to be as perfect a Rule as a Writing can be; only we deny it to be as perfect a Rule
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64345:41"/>as a writing may be. Either therefore you muſt revoke your acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or retract your retractation of it; for both cannot poſſibly ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For if you will ſtand to what you have granted, That <hi>Scripture is as perfect a Rule of Faith as a writing can be:</hi> you muſt then grant it both ſo <hi>Compleat,</hi> that it needs no addition, and ſo <hi>evident,</hi> that it needs no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation: For both theſe properties are requiſite to a <hi>perfect Rule,</hi> and a writing is capable of both theſe properties.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. That both theſe properties are requiſite to a <hi>perfect Rule,</hi> it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: Becauſe that is not perfect in any kind which wants ſome parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to its integrity; As, he is not a perfect man that wants any part ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the Integrity of a Man; and therefore that which wants any acceſſion to make it a perfect Rule, of it ſelf is not a perfect Rule. And then, the end of a <hi>Rule</hi> is to regulate and direct. Now every inſtrument is more or leſſe perfect in its kind, as it is more or leſſe fit to attain the end for which it is ordained: But nothing obſcure or unevident while it is ſo, is fit to regulate and direct them to whom it is ſo: Therefore it is requiſite alſo to a <hi>Rule</hi> (ſo farr as it is a Rule) to be evident; otherwiſe indeed it is no <hi>Rule,</hi> becauſe it cannot ſerve for direction. I conclude therefore, that both theſe properties are required to a perfect Rule: both to be ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat as to need no Addition; and to be ſo evident as to need no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Now that a writing is capable of both theſe perfections, it is ſo plain, that I am even aſhamed to prove it. For he that denies it, muſt ſay, That <hi>ſomething may be ſpoken which cannot be written.</hi> For if ſuch a compleat and evident Rule of Faith may be delivered by word of mouth, as you pretend it may, and is; and whatſoever is delivered by word of mouth may alſo be written; then ſuch a compleat and evident Rule of Faith may alſo be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. If you will have more light added to the Sun, anſwer me then to theſe Queſtions. Whether your Church can ſet down in writting all theſe, which ſhe pretends to be divine unwritten Traditions, and add them to the verities already written? And, Whether ſhe can ſet us down ſuch inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of all obſcurities in the Faith as ſhall need no farther interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations? If ſhe cannot, then ſhe hath not that power which you pretend ſhe hath, of being an <hi>Infallible Teacher of all divine verities,</hi> and an infallible Interpreter of obſcurities in the Faith: for ſhe cannot teach us all divine verities, if ſhe cannot write them down; neither is that an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation which needs again to be interpreted. If ſhe can; Let her do it, and then we ſhall have a writting, not only capable of, but, actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with, both theſe perfections, of being both ſo compleat as to need no Addition, and ſo evident as to need no Interpretation. Laſtly, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever your Church can do or not do, no man can, without Blaſphemy, deny, that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> if he had pleaſed, could have writ us a Rule of Faith ſo plain and perfect, as that it ſhould have wanted neither any part to make up its integrity, nor any cleerneſs to make it ſufficiently intelligible. And if Chriſt could have done this, then the thing might have been done; a writting there might have been, indowed with both theſe properties. Thus therefore I conclude; a writing may be ſo perfect a Rule, as to need neither Addition nor Interpretation; But the <hi>Scripture you acknowledg a perfect Rule for as much as a writing can be a Rule,</hi> therefore it needs neither Addition nor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</p>

8. You will ſay, that <hi>though a writing be never ſo perfect a Rule of Faith, yet it muſt be beholding to Tradition to give it this Teſtimony, that it is a Rule of Faith, and the Word of God.</hi> I anſwer: Firſt, there is no abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of this. For God might, if he thought good, give it the atteſtation of perpetuall miracles. Secondly, that it is one thing to be a perfect Rule of Faith, another to be proved ſo unto us. And this though a writing could not be proved to us to be a perfect rule of Faith, by its owne ſaying ſo, for nothing is proved true by being ſaid or written in a book, but only by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which is a thing credible of it ſelf, yet it may be ſo in it ſelf, and contain all the material objects, all the particular articles of our Faith, without any dependance upon Tradition; even this alſo not excepted, that <hi>this writing doth contain the rule of Faith.</hi> Now when Proteſtants affirm againſt Papiſts, that <hi>Scripture is a perfect Rule of Faith,</hi> their meaning is not, that by Scripture all things abſolutely may be proved, which are to be believed: For it can never be proved by Scripture to a gainſayer, that there is a God, or that the book called Scripture is the word of God; For he that will deny theſe Aſſertions when they are ſpoken, will believe them never a whit the more, becauſe you can ſhew them written: But their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that the Scripture to them which preſuppoſe it Divine, and a Rule of Faith, as Papiſts and Proteſtants do, contains all the material objects of Faith; is a compleat and total, and not onely an imperfect and a partial Rule.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. <hi>But every Book, and Chapter, and Text of Scripture is infallible and wants no due perfection, and yet excludes not the Addition of other books of Scripture; Therefore the perfection of the whole Scripture excludes not the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of unwritten Tradition.</hi> I anſwer; Every Text of Scripture though it hath the perfection belonging to a Text of Scripture, yet it hath not the perfection requiſite to a <hi>perfect Rule of Faith;</hi> and that only is the perfection which is the ſubject of our diſcourſe. So that this is to abuſe your Reader with the ambiguity of the word <hi>Perfect.</hi> In effect, as if you ſhould ſay, A text of Scripture may be a perfect Text, though there be others beſide it; therefore the whole Scripture may be a perfect Rule of Faith, though there be other parts of this Rule, beſides the Scripture, and though the Scripture be but a part of it.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. The next Argument to the ſame purpoſe is, for Sophiſtry, coſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>german to the former. <hi>When the firſt books of Scripture were written, they did not exclude unwritten Tradition: Therefore now alſo, that all the books of Scripture are written, Traditions are not excluded.</hi> The ſenſe of which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (if it have any) muſt be this. When only a part of the Scripture was written, then a part of the divine doctrine was unwritten; Therefore now when all the Scripture is written, yet ſome part of the divine doctrine is yet unwritten. If you ſay, your Concluſion is not, that it is ſo, but, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement to Scripture, may be ſo: without diſparagement to the truth of Scripture, I grant it; but without diſparagement to the Scripture's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>perfect Rule,</hi> I deny it. And now the Queſtion is not of the Truth, but the perfection of it; which are very different things, though you would fain confound them. For Scripture might very well be all true, though it contain not all neceſſary Divine Truth. But unleſſe it do ſo, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a <hi>perfect Rule of Faith;</hi> for that which wants any thing is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. For, I hope, you do not imagine, that we conceive any antipathy
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64345:42"/>between God's Word written and unwritten, but that both might very well ſtand together. All that we ſay is this, that we have reaſon to believe that God, <hi>de facto,</hi> hath ordered the matter ſo, that all the Goſpel of Chriſt, the whole Covenant between God and man, is now written. Whereas, if he had pleaſed, he might ſo have diſpoſed it, that, part might have been written, and part unwritten: but then he would have taken order, to whom we ſhould have had recourſe, for that part of it which was not written; which ſeeing he hath not done (as the progreſſe ſhall demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate) it is evident he hath left no part of it unwritten. We know no man therefore that ſayes, It were any injury to the written Word to be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the unwritten, if there were any wherewith it might be joyned: but that, we deny. The fidelity of a keeper may very well conſiſt with the authority of the thing committed to his cuſtody. But we know no one ſociety of Chriſtians that is ſuch a faithfull keeper as you pretend. The Scripture it ſelf was not kept ſo faithfully by you, but that you ſuffered infinite variety of Readings to creep into it; all which could not poſſibly be divine, and yet, in ſeveral parts of your Church, all of them, until the laſt Age, were ſo eſteemed. The interpretations of obſcure places of Scripture, which without Queſtion the Apoſtles taught the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, are wholly loſt; there remains no certainty ſcarce of any one. Thoſe <hi>Worlds of Miracles,</hi> which our Saviour did, which were not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, for want of writing are vaniſhed out of the memory of men. And many profitable things which the Apoſtles taught and writ not, as that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> glanceth at in his <hi>ſecond Epiſtle to the Theſſal.</hi> of the <hi>cauſe of the hinderance of the coming of Antichriſt,</hi> are wholly loſt and extinguiſhed. So unfaithful or negligent hath been this Keeper of Divine Verities; whoſe eyes, like the Keepers of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (you ſay) have <hi>never ſlumbred nor ſlept.</hi> Laſtly, we deny not but a Judge and a Law might well ſtand together, but we deny that there is any ſuch Judge of Gods appointment. Had he intended any ſuch Judge, he would have named him, leſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (as now it is) our <hi>Judge of Controverſies</hi> ſhould be our greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. In your ſecond Paragraph, you ſum up thoſe Arguments wherewith you intend to prove that <hi>Scripture alone cannot be Judge in Controverſies.</hi> Wherein I profeſs unto you before hand, that you will fight without an Adverſary. For though Proteſtants, being warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome of the Fathers, have called Scripture the <hi>Judge of Controverſie;</hi> and you, in ſaying here, That Scripture <hi>alone</hi> cannot be Judge, imply that it may be called in ſome ſenſe a Judge, though not alone: Yet, to ſpeak properly (as men ſhould ſpeak when they write of Controverſies in Religion) the Scripture is not a Judge of Controverſies, but <hi>a Rule only, and the only Rule for Chriſtians to judge them by.</hi> Every man is to judge for himſelf with the <hi>Judgement of Diſcretion,</hi> and to chooſe either his Religion firſt, and then his Church, as we ſay: or, as you, his Church firſt, and then his Religion. But, by the conſent of both ſides, every man is to judge and chooſe: and the Rule whereby he is to guide his choice, if he be a natural man, is Reaſon; if he be already a Chriſtian, Scripture; which we ſay is the Rule to judge Controverſies by. Yet not all ſimply, but all the, Controverſies of Chriſtians, of thoſe that are already agreed upon This firſt Principle, that <hi>the Scripture is the Word of God.</hi> But that there is any
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64345:42"/>Man, or any Company of men appointed to be Judge for all man, that we deny; and that I believe, you will never prove. The very truth is, we ſay no more in this matter, than evidence of Truth hath made you confeſs in plain terms in the beginning of this Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Scripture is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Rule of Faith, for as much as a writing can be a Rule.</hi> So that all your Reaſons, whereby you labour to dethrone the Scripture from this Office of <hi>Judging,</hi> we might let paſs as impertinent to the Concluſion which we maintain, and you have already granted; yet out of courteſie we will conſider them.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Your firſt is this; <hi>A Judge muſt be a perſon fit to end Controverſies; but the Scripture is not a perſon, nor fit to end Controverſies, no more than the Law would be without the Judges; therefore though it may be a Rule, it cannot be a Judge.</hi> Which concluſion I have already granted. Only my requeſt is, that you will permit Scripture to have the properties of a Rule, that is, to be fit to direct every one that will make the beſt uſe of it, to that end for which it was ordained: And that is as much as we need deſire. For, as if I were to go a journey, and had a guide which could not err, I needed not to know my way: ſo on the other ſide, if I know my way, or have a plain rule to know it by, I ſhall need no guide. Grant therefore Scripture to be ſuch a Rule, and it will quickly take away all neceſſity of having an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible guide. But <hi>without a living Judge it will be no fitter</hi> (you ſay) <hi>to end Controverſies, than the Law alone to end ſuits.</hi> I anſwer, if the Law were plain and perfect, and men honeſt and deſirous to underſtand aright, and obey it, he that ſays it were not fit to end Controverſies, muſt either want underſtanding himſelf, or think the world wants it. Now <hi>the Scripture,</hi> we pretend, <hi>in things neceſſary is plain and perfect;</hi> and men, we ſay, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged under pain of Damnation, to ſeek the true ſenſe of it, and not to wreſt it to their preconceived Fancies. Such a law therefore to ſuch men, cannot but be very fit to end all Controverſies neceſſary to be ended. For others that are not ſo, they will end when the world ends, and that is time enough.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. Your next encounter is with them, who acknowledging the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a Rule only and not a Judge, make the holy Ghoſt, ſpeaking in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Judge of Controverſies. Which you diſprove by ſaying, <hi>That, the holy Ghoſt ſpeaking only in Scripture is no more intelligible to us, than the Scripture in which he ſpeaks.</hi> But by this reaſon, neither the Pope, nor a Councel can be a Judge neither. For firſt, denying the Scriptures, the writings of the holy Ghoſt, to be Judges; you will not, I hope, offer to pretend, that their Decrees, the writings of men, are more capable of this function: the ſame exceptions at leaſt, if not more, and greater lying againſt them as do againſt Scripture. And then what you object againſt the holy Ghoſt, ſpeaking in Scripture, to exclude him from this office, The ſame I return upon them and their Decrees, to debar them from it; that they ſpeaking unto us only in their Decrees, are no more intelligible than the Decrees in which they ſpeak. And therefore if the Holy Ghoſt ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Scripture may not be a Judge for this Reaſon; neither may they, ſpeaking in their Decrees, be Judges for the ſame Reaſon. <hi>If the Pope's Decrees</hi> (you will ſay) <hi>be obſcure, he can explain himſelf; and ſo the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot.</hi> But the holy Ghoſt, that ſpeaks in Scripture, can do ſo, if he pleaſe; and, when he is pleaſed, will do ſo. In the mean time, it will be fit for you to wait his leiſure, and to be content, that thoſe things of Scripture
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64345:43"/>which are plain ſhould be ſo, and thoſe which are obſcure ſhould remain obſcure, until he pleaſe to declare them. Beſides, he can (which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not warrant me of the Pope or a Councel) ſpeak at firſt ſo plainly, that his words ſhall need no farther explanation; and ſo in things neceſſary we believe he hath done. And if you ſay, <hi>The Decrees of Councels touching Controverſies, though they be not the Judge, yet they are the Judge's ſentence:</hi> So, I ſay, the Scripture, though not the Judge, is the ſentence of the Judge. When therefore you conclude, <hi>That, to ſay a Judge is neceſſary for deciding Controverſies about the meaning of Scripture, is as much as to ſay, He is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to decide what the holy Ghoſt ſpeaks in Scripture:</hi> This, I grant, is true; but I may not grant that a Judge (ſuch an one as we diſpute of) is neceſſary either to do the one, or the other. For, if the Scripture (as it is in things neceſſary) be plain, why ſhould it be more neceſſary to have a Judg to interpret them in plain places, than to have a Judg to interpret the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Councel's Decrees, and others to interpret their Interpretations, &amp; others to interpret theirs, and ſo on for ever? And where they are not plain, there if we, uſing diligence to find the Truth, do yet miſs of it and fall into Errour, there is no danger in it. They that err, and they that do not err, may both be ſaved. So that thoſe places, which contain things neceſſary, and wherein Errour were dangerous, need no infallible interpreter, becauſe they are plain: and thoſe that are obſcure need none, becauſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not things Neceſſary, neither is Errour in them dangerous.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. <hi>The Law-maker ſpeaking in the Law,</hi> I grant it, <hi>is no more eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood than the Law it ſelf;</hi> for his ſpeech is nothing elſe but the Law: I grant it <hi>very neceſſary, that, beſides the Law-maker ſpeaking in the Law, there ſhould be other Judges to determine Civil and Criminal Controverſies, and to give every man that juſtice which the Law allows him.</hi> But your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument drawn from hence to ſhew a neceſſity of a Viſible Judge in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies of Religion, I ſay is Sophiſtical: and that for many Reaſons.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Firſt, Becauſe the variety of Civil caſes is infinite, and therefore there cannot be poſſibly Laws enough provided for the determination of them: and therefore there muſt be a Judge to ſupply out of the Principles of Reaſon the interpretation of the Law where it is defective. But the Scripture (we ſay) is a perfect Rule of Faith, and therefore needs no ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of the defects of it.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. Secondly, To execute the Leter of the Law, according to rigor, would be many times unjuſt, and therefore there is need of a Judge to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate it; whereof in Religion there is no uſe at all.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. Thirdly, In Civil and Criminal Cauſes the parties have for the moſt part ſo much intereſt, and very often ſo little honeſty, that they will not ſubmit to a Law though never ſo plain, if it be againſt them; or will not ſee it to be againſt them, though it be ſo never ſo plainly: whereas if men were honeſt, and the Law were plain and extended to all caſes, there would be little need of Judges. Now in matters of Religion, when the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, Whether every man be a fit Judge and chooſer for himſelf, we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe men honeſt, and ſuch as underſtand the difference between a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Eternity. And ſuch men we conceive, will think it highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them to be of the true Religion, but nothing at all that this or that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſhould be the true. And then we ſuppoſe that all the neceſſary points of Religion are plain and eaſie, and conſequently every man in this cauſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64345:43"/>to be a competent Judge for himſelf; becauſe it concerns himſelf to judge right as much as eternal happineſs is worth. And if, through his own default he judge amiſs, he alone ſhall ſuffer for it.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. Fourthly, In Civil Controverſies we are obliged only to external paſſive obedience, and not to an internal and active. We are bound to obey the ſentence of the Judge, or not to reſiſt it, but not alwayes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it juſt. But, in matters of Religion, ſuch a Judge is required whom we ſhould be obliged to believe, to have judged right. So that in Civil Controverſies every honeſt underſtanding man is fit to be a Judge; But in Religion none but he that is infallible.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. Fifthly, In Civil Cauſes there is means and power, when the Judge hath decreed, to compell men to obey his ſentence: otherwiſe, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Laws alone, would be to as much purpoſe for the ending of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, as Laws and Judges both. But all the power in the world is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fit to convince, nor able to compell a man's conſcience to conſent to any thing. Worldly terrour may prevail ſo far as to make men profeſs a Religion which they believe not, (ſuch men I mean, who know not that there is a Heaven provided for Martyrs, and a Hell for thoſe that diſſemble ſuch Truths as are neceſſary to be profeſſed): But to force, either any man to believe what he believes not, or any honeſt man to diſſemble what he does believe (if God commands him to profeſs it,) or to profeſs what he does not believe, all the Powers in the World are too weak, with all the Powers of Hell to aſſiſt them.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. Sixthly, In Civil Controverſies the caſe cannot be ſo put, but there may be Judge to end it, who is not a party: In Controverſies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it is in a manner impoſſible to be avoided, but the Judge muſt be a party. For this muſt be the firſt, Whether he be a Judge or no, and in that he muſt be a party. Sure I am, the Pope, in the Controverſies of our time, is a chief party; for it highly concerns him, even as much as his Popedom is worth, not to yield any one point of his Religion to be er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous. And he is a man ſubject to like paſſions with other men. And therefore we may juſtly decline his ſentence, for fear temporal reſpects ſhould either blind his judgement, or make him pronounce againſt it.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. Seventhly, In Civil Controverſies, it is impoſſible <hi>Titius</hi> ſhould hold the land in queſtion and <hi>Sempronius</hi> too: and therefore either the Plaintiff muſt injure the Defendant by diſquieting his poſſeſſion, or the Defendant wrong the Plaintiff by keeping his right from him. But in Controverſies of Religion, the Caſe is otherwiſe. I may hold my opinion and do you no wrong, and you yours and do me none. Nay, we may both of us hold our opinion, and yet do our ſelves no harm; provided, the difference be not touching any thing neceſſary to ſalvation, and that we love truth ſo well, as to be diligent to inform our Conſcience, &amp; conſtant in following it.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. Eighthly, For the deciding of Civil Controverſies, men may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point themſelves a Judge. But, in matters of Religion, this office may be given to none but whom God hath deſigned for it: who doth not alwayes give us thoſe things which we conceive moſt expedient for our ſelves.</p>
                        <p n="22">22. Ninthly, and Laſtly, For the ending of Civil Controverſies, Who does not ſee, it is abſolutely neceſſary, that not only Judges ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, but that it ſhould be known and unqueſtioned who they are? Thus all the Judges of our Land are known men, known to be Judges, and no man
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64345:44"/>can doubt or queſtion, but theſe are the Men. Otherwiſe, if it were a diſputable thing, Who were theſe Judges, and they had no certain war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for their Authority, but only ſome Topical congruities; Would not any man ſay, ſuch Judges, in all likelihood, would rather multiply Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, than end them? So likewiſe, if our Saviour, the King of Heaven, had intended that all Controverſies in Religion ſhould be by ſome viſible Judge finally determined, Who can doubt, but in plain terms he would have expreſſed himſelf about this matter? He would have ſaid plainly, <hi>The Biſhop of Rome I have appointed to decide all emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Controverſies.</hi> For that our Saviour deſigned the <hi>Biſhop of Rome</hi> to this Office, and yet would not ſay ſo, nor cauſe it to be written—<hi>ad Rei memoriam</hi>—by any of the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> or <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ſo much as once; but leave it to be drawn out of uncertain Principles, by thirteen or fourteen more uncertain Conſequences, He that can believe it, let him.</p>
                        <p n="23">23. All theſe Reaſons, I hope, will convince you, that though we have, and have great neceſſity of, Judges in Civil and Criminal Cauſes: yet you may not conclude from thence, that there is any publique autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized Judge to determine Controverſies in Religion, nor any neceſſity there ſhould be any.</p>
                        <p n="24">24. <hi>But the Scripture ſtands in need of ſome watchful and unerring eye to guard it, by means of whoſe aſſured Vigilancy, we may undoubtedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it ſincere and pure.</hi> Very true, but this is no other than the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eye of Divine Providence: the goodneſs whereof will never ſuffer, that the Scripture ſhould be depraved and corrupted, but that in them ſhould be always extant a conſpicuous and plain way to eternal happineſs. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any thing be more palpably unconſiſtent with his goodneſs, than to ſuffer Scripture to be undiſcernably corrupted in any matter of moment, and yet to exact of men the Belief of thoſe verities, which, without their fault, or knowledge, or poſſibility of prevention, were defaced out of them. So that God requiring of men to believe Scripture in its purity, ingages himſelf to ſee it preſerved in ſufficient purity; and you need not fear but he will ſatisfie his engagement. You ſay, <hi>We can have no aſſurance of this, but your Churches Vigilancy.</hi> But if we had no other, we were in a hard caſe; for, Who could then aſſure us that your Church hath been ſo vigilant, as to guard Scripture from any the leaſt alteration? There being various Lections in the ancient Copies of your Bibles, What ſecurity can your new raiſed <hi>Office of Aſſurance</hi> give us, that that reading is true which you now receive, and that falſe which you reject? Certainly, they that anciently received and made uſe of thoſe divers Copies, were not all guarded by the Churches Vigilancy from having their Scripture altered from the purity of the Original in many places. For of different readings, it is not in nature impoſſible that all ſhould be falſe, but more than one cannot poſſibly be true. Yet the want of ſuch a protection, was no hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to their ſalvation, and Why then ſhall the having of it be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for ours? But then, this Vigilancy of your Church, what means have we to be aſcertained of it? Firſt, the thing is not evident of it ſelf; which is evident, becauſe many do not believe it. Neither can any thing be pretended to give evidence to it, but only ſome places of Scripture; of whoſe incorruption more than any other, what is it that can ſecure me? If you ſay the Churches Vigilancy, you are in a Circle, proving the Scriptures
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64345:44"/>uncorrupted by the Churche's Vigilancy, and the Churche's Vigilancy by the incorruption of ſome places of Scripture, and again the incorruption of thoſe places by the Churche's Vigilancy. If you name any other means; then, that means which ſecures me of the Scripture's incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in thoſe places, will alſo ſerve to aſſure me of the ſame in other places. For my part, abſtracting from Divine Providence, which will never ſuffer the way to Heaven to be blocked up, or made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, I know no other means (I mean, no other natural and rational means) to be aſſured hereof, than I have that any other Book is uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. For, though I have a greater degree of rational and humane Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of that than this, in regard of divers conſiderations which make it more credible, <hi>That the Scripture hath been preſerved from any material al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration;</hi> yet my Aſſurance of both is of the ſame kind and condition; both Moral Aſſurances, and neither Phyſical or Mathematical.</p>
                        <p n="25">25. To the next Argument the Reply is obvious; <hi>That, though we do not believe the Books of Scripture to be canonical, becauſe they ſay ſo,</hi> (For other Books that are not Canonical may ſay they are, and thoſe that are ſo, may ſay nothing of it): yet we believe not this upon the Authority of your Church, but upon the Credibility of <hi>Univerſal Tradition,</hi> which is a thing <hi>Credible of it ſelf,</hi> and therefore fit to be reſted on; whereas the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of your Church is not ſo. And therefore your reſt thereon is not Rational but meerly voluntary. I might as well reſt upon the judgement of the next man I meet, or upon the chance of a Lottery for it. For by this means I only know I might err, but by replying on you I know I ſhould err. But yet (to return you one Suppoſe for another) ſuppoſe I ſhould for this and all other things ſubmit to her direction, How could ſhe aſſure me that I ſhould not be miſled by doing ſo? She pretends indeed infallibility herein, but how can ſhe aſſure us that ſhe hath it? What, by Scripture? That, you ſay, cannot aſſure us of its own Infallibility, and therefore not of yours. What then, by Reaſon? That, you ſay, may deceive in other things, and why not in this? How then will ſhe aſſure us hereof, By ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo? Of this very affirmation there will remain the ſame Queſtion ſtill, How can it prove it ſelf to be infallibly true? Neither can there be an end of the life multiplied Demands, till we reſt in ſomething evident of it ſelf, which demonſtrates to the world that this Church is infallible. And ſeeing there is no ſuch Rock for the Infallibility of this Church to be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on, it muſt of neceſſity, like the Iland of <hi>Delos,</hi> flote up and down for ever. And yet upon this Point according to Papiſts, all other Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in ſaith depend.</p>
                        <p n="26">26. <hi>To the</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. §. The ſum and ſubſtance of the Ten next Paragraphs, is this, <hi>That it appears, by the Confeſsion of ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and the Contentions of others, that the Queſtions about the Canon of Scripture, what it is; and about the Various Reading and Tranſlations of it, which is true, and which not: are not to be determined by Scripture, and therefore that all Controverſies of Religion are not decidable by Scripture.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="27">27. To which I have already anſwered, ſaying, That, when Scripture is affirmed to be the Rule by which all Controverſies of Religion are to be decided, Thoſe are to be excepted out of this generality, which are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture it ſelf. For, as that general ſaying of Scripture, <hi>He hath put all things under his feet,</hi> is moſt true, though yet S. <hi>Paul</hi> tell us, <hi>That
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64345:45"/>when it is ſaid, He hath put all things under him, it is manifeſt he is excepted who did put all things under him:</hi> So when we ſay that all Controverſies of Religion are decidable by the Scripture, it is manifeſt to all, but cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, that we do, and muſt, except from this generality, thoſe which are <hi>touching the Scripture it ſelf.</hi> Juſt as a Merchant ſhewing a Ship of his own, may ſay, All my ſubſtance is in this Ship; and yet never intend to deny, that his Ship is part of his ſubſtance, nor yet to ſay that his Ship is in it ſelf. Or, as a man may ſay, that a whole houſe is ſupported by the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet never mean to exclude the foundation from being a part of the houſe, or to ſay; that it is ſupported by it ſelf. Or as you your ſelves uſe to ſay, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> is Head of the whole Church, and yet would think us but captious Sophiſters, ſhould we infer from hence, that either you made him no part of the whole, or elſe made him head of himſelf. Your Negative Concluſion, therefore, that theſe <hi>Queſtions touching Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, are not decidable by Scripture,</hi> you needed not have cited any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, nor urged any Reaſon to prove it; it is evident of it ſelf, and I grant it without more ado. But your corollary from it, which you would inſinuate to your unwary Reader, <hi>That therefore they are to be decided by your, or any, Viſible Church,</hi> is a meer inconſequence, and very like his collection, who, becauſe <hi>Pamphilus</hi> was not to have <hi>Glycerium</hi> for his Wife, preſently concluded that he muſt have her; as if there had been no more men in the World but <hi>Pamphilus</hi> and himſelf. For ſo you, as if there were nothing in the World capable of this Office, but the Scripture, or the preſent Church; having concluded againſt Scripture, you conceive, but too haſtily, that you have concluded for the Church. But the truth is, neither the one nor the other have any thing to do with this matter. For firſt, the Queſtion <hi>whether ſuch or ſuch a Book be Canonical Scripture,</hi> though it may be decided negatively out of Scripture, by ſhewing appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and irreconcileable contradictions between it and ſome other Book confeſſedly Canonical; yet affirmatively it cannot but only by the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Ancient Churches: any Book being to be received as undoubtedly Canonical, or to be doubted of as Uncertain, or rejected as Apocryphal, according as it was received, or doubted of, or rejected by them. Then for the Queſtion, <hi>Of various readings which is the true?</hi> it is in reaſon evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and confeſſed by your own Pope, that there is no poſſible determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, but only by compariſon with ancient Copies. And laſtly, for controverſies about different tranſlations of Scripture, the Learned have the ſame means to ſatisfie themſelves in it, as in the Queſtions which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen about the tranſlation of any other Author; that is, skill in the Language of the Original, and comparing tranſlations with it. In which way if there be no certainty, I would know that certainty you have, that your <hi>Doway</hi> old, and <hi>Rhemiſh</hi> new Teſtament, are true tranſlations? And then for the unlearned, thoſe on your ſide are ſubject to as much, nay the very ſame uncertainty with thoſe on ours. Neither is there any reaſon imaginable, why an ignorant Engliſh Proteſtant may not be as ſecure of of the Tranſlation of our Church, that it is free from errour, if not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, yet in matters of moment, as an ignorant Engliſh Papiſt can be of his <hi>Rhemiſt</hi> Teſtament, or <hi>Doway</hi> Bible. The beſt direction I can give them, is, to compare both together, and where there is no real difference (as in the Tranſlation of controverted places I believe there is very little) there
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64345:45"/>to be confident, that they are right; where they differ, there to be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the choice of the Guides they follow. Which way of proceeding if it be ſubject to ſome poſſible errour, yet is it the beſt that either we, or you have; &amp; it is not required that we uſe any better than the beſt we have.</p>
                        <p n="28">28. You will ſay, <hi>Dependance on your Churches infallibility is a better.</hi> I anſwer, it would be ſo, if we could be infallibly certain, that your Church is infallible, that is, if it were either evident of it ſelf, and ſeen by its own light, or could be reduced unto, and ſetled upon, ſome Principle that is ſo. But ſeeing you your ſelves do not ſo much as pretend to enforce us to the belief hereof, by any proofs infallible and convincing; but only to induce us to it, by ſuch as are, by your confeſſion, only probable and <hi>prudential Motives;</hi> certainly it will be to very little purpoſe, to put off your uncertainty for the firſt turn, and to fall upon it at the ſecond: to pleaſe your ſelves in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your houſe upon an imaginary Rock when you your ſelves ſee and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that this very Rock ſtands it ſelf at the beſt but upon a frame of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. I anſwer ſecondly, that this cannot be a better way, becauſe we are infallibly certain that your Church is not infallible, and indeed hath not the real Preſcription of this Priviledge, but only pleaſeth her ſelf with a falſe imagination and vain preſumption of it; as I ſhall hereafter demonſtrate by many unanſwerable Arguments.</p>
                        <p n="29">29. Now ſeeing I make no ſcruple or difficulty to grant the concluſion of this Diſcourſe, that, <hi>Theſe controverſies about Scripture, are not decidable by Scripture;</hi> and have ſhewed, that your deduction from it, that <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are to be determined by the Authority of ſome preſent Church,</hi> is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational, and inconſequent; I might well forbear to tire myſelf with an exact and punctual examination of your premiſes <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p n="31">31. But, <hi>ſeeing the belief of Scripture is a neceſſary thing, and cannot be proved by Scripture, How can the Church of</hi> England <hi>teach, as ſhe doth,</hi> Art. 6. <hi>That all things neceſſary are contained in Scripture?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="32">32. I have anſwered this already. And here again, I ſay, That all but cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers will eaſily underſtand the meaning of the Article to be, That all the Divine verities, which Chriſt revealed to his Apoſtles, and the Apoſtles taught the Churches, are contained in Scripture; That is, all the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al objects of our Faith; whereof the Scripture is none, but only the means of conveying them unto us: which we believe not finally, and for it ſelf, but for the matter contained in it. So that, if men did believe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contained in Scripture, it ſhould no way hinder their ſalvation, not to know whether there were any Scripture or no. Thoſe barbarous Nations <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſpeaks of, were in this caſe, and yet no doubt but they might be ſaved. The end that God aims at, is the belief of the Goſpel, the Covenant between God and Man; the Scripture he hath provided as a means for this end, and this alſo we are to believe, but not as the laſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Faith, but as the Inſtrument of it. When therefore we ſubſcribe to the 6 <hi>Art.</hi> you muſt underſtand, that, by <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> they mean the final and ultimate Objects of it, and not the Means and inſtrumental Objects; and then there will be no repugnance between what they ſay, and that which <hi>Hooker,</hi> and D. <hi>Covel,</hi> and D. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> here ſay.</p>
                        <p n="33">33. But <hi>Proteſtants agree not in aſsigning the Canon of Holy Scripture.</hi> Luther <hi>and</hi> Illyricus <hi>reject the Epiſtle of S.</hi> James: Kemnitius, <hi>and other Lutherans, the ſecond of</hi> Peter, <hi>the ſecond and third of</hi> John. <hi>The Epiſtle to the Hebrews, the Epiſtle of</hi> James, <hi>of</hi> Jude, <hi>and the Apocalyps. Therefore without the Authority of the Church, no certainty can be had what Scripture is Canonical.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="34">34. So alſo the <hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi> and not only Fathers, but <hi>whole Churches,</hi> differed about the certainty of the Authority of the very ſame Books: and by their difference ſhewed, they knew no neceſſity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64345:46"/>themſelves herein to the judgement of your or any Church. For had they done ſo, they muſt have agreed all with that Church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently among themſelves. Now, I pray, tell me plainly, Had they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient certainty what Scripture was Canonical, or had they not? If they had not, it ſeems there is no great harm or danger in not having ſuch a certainty whether ſome Books be Canonical or no, as you require: If they had, Why may not Proteſtants, notwithſtanding their differences, have ſufficient certainty hereof, as well as the Ancient Fathers and Churches, notwithſtanding theirs?</p>
                        <p n="35">35. You proceed. And whereas the Proteſtants of <hi>England</hi> in the 6. <hi>Art.</hi> have theſe words, <hi>In the name of the Holy Scripture we do underſtand thoſe Books, of whoſe Authority was never any doubt in the Church;</hi> you demand, <hi>What they mean by them? Whether that, by the Churches conſent they are aſſured what Scriptures be Canonical?</hi> I anſwer for them. Yes, they are ſo. And whereas you inferre from hence, <hi>This is to make the Church Judge:</hi> I have told you already, That, <hi>of this Controverſie we make the Church the Judge;</hi> but not the preſent Church, much leſs the preſent Roman Church, but the conſent and teſtimony of the <hi>Ancient and Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church,</hi> Which, though it be but an highly probable inducement, and no demonſtrative enforcement; yet me-thinks you ſhould not deny but may be a ſufficient ground of Faith: Whoſe Faith, even of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all your Faith, your Churches Authority is built laſtly and wholly upon <hi>Prudential Motives.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="36">36. But, <hi>by this Rule the whole Book of</hi> Eſther <hi>muſt quit the Canon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was excluded by ſome in the Church:</hi> by <hi>Melito, Athanaſius,</hi> and <hi>Gregory Nazianzen.</hi> Then, for ought I know, he that ſhould think he had reaſon to exclude it now, might be ſtill in the Church as well as <hi>Melito, Athanaſius, Nazianzen</hi> were. And while you thus inveigh againſt <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and charge him with Luciferian hereſies, for doing that which you in this very place confeſs, that Saints in Heaven before him have done, <hi>are you not partial, and a Judge of evil thoughts?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="37">37. <hi>Luther</hi>'s cenſures of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes, Job,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> though you make ſuch tragedies with them, I ſee none of them but is capable of a tolerable conſtruction, and far from having in them any fundamental He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie. He that condemns him for ſaying, the Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes is not full, That it hath many abrupt things,</hi> condemns him, for ought I can ſee, for ſpeaking truth. And the reſt of the cenſure is but a bold and blunt expreſſion of the ſame thing. The Book of <hi>Job</hi> may be a true Hiſtory, and yet, as many true ſtories are, and have been, and Argument of a Fable to ſet before us an example of Patience. And though the Books of the Prophets were not written by themſelves, but by their Diſciples, yet it does not follow that they were written caſually: (Though I hope, you will not damn all for Hereticks, that ſay, Some Books of Scripture were written caſually.) Neither is there any reaſon they ſhould the ſooner be called in queſtion for being written by their Diſciples, ſeeing being ſo written, they had atteſtation from themſelves. Was the Propheſie of <hi>Jeremy</hi> the leſs Canonical, for being written by <hi>Baruch?</hi> Or, becauſe S. <hi>Peter</hi> the Maſter, dictated the Goſpel, and S. <hi>Mark</hi> the Scholler writ it, is it the more likely to be called in Queſtion?</p>
                        <p n="38">38. But leaving <hi>Luther,</hi> you return to our Engliſh Canon of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64345:47"/>And tell us, That, <hi>in the New Teſtament, by the above-mentioned Rule (of whoſe Authority was never doubt in the Church) divers Books muſt be diſ-canonized.</hi> Not ſo. For I may believe even thoſe queſtioned Books to have been written by the Apoſtles, and to be Canonical: but I cannot in reaſon believe this of them ſo undoubtedly, as of <hi>thoſe Books which were never queſtioned.</hi> At leaſt I have no warrant to damn any man that ſhall doubt of them or deny them now: having the example of Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, either to juſtifie, or excuſe ſuch their doubting or denial.</p>
                        <p n="39">39. You obſerve in the next place, That <hi>our ſixth Article, ſpecifying by name all the Books of the Old Teſtament, ſhuffles over thoſe of the New with this generality—All the Books of the New Teſtament, as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly received, we do receive, and account them Canonical:</hi> And in this you fancy to your ſelf <hi>a myſterie of iniquity.</hi> But if this be all the ſhuffling that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is guilty of, I believe the Church, as well as the King, may give for her Motto, <hi>Honi ſoit qui mal y penſe.</hi> For all the Bibles, which ſince the compoſing of the Articles have been uſed and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the <hi>Church of England,</hi> do teſtifie and even proclaim to the World, that by <hi>Commonly-received,</hi> they meant, <hi>received by the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>and other Churches before the Reformation.</hi> I pray, take the pains to look in them, and there you ſhall find the Books, which the Church of <hi>England</hi> counts Apocryphal, marked out, and ſevered from the reſt, with this Title in the beginning, <hi>The Books called Apocrypha;</hi> and with this cloſe or ſeal in the end, <hi>The end of the Apocrypha.</hi> And having told you by name, and, in particular, what Books only ſhe eſteems <hi>Apocryphal,</hi> I hope you will not put her to the trouble of telling you, that the reſt are in her judgment <hi>Canonical.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="40">40. <hi>But, if by</hi> Commonly-received, <hi>She meant, by the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>then by the ſame reaſon, muſt ſhe receive divers Books of the Old Teſtament which ſhe rejects.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="41">41. Certainly, a very good conſequence. The Church of <hi>England</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Books of the New Teſtament, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives; Therefore ſhe muſt receive the Books of the Old Teſtament which ſhe receives. As if you ſhould ſay, If you will do as we, in one thing, you muſt in all things. If you will pray to God with us, ye muſt pray to Saints with us. If you hold with us, when we have reaſon on our Side, you muſt do ſo, when we have no reaſon.</p>
                        <p n="42">42. The Diſcourſe following, is but a vain Declamation. No man thinks that this Controverſie is to be tried by Moſt Voices, but by the Judgement and Teſtimony of the Ancient Fathers and Churches.</p>
                        <p n="43">43. But, <hi>with what Coherence can we ſay in the former part of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, That,</hi> by Scripture we mean thoſe Books that were never doubted of; <hi>and in the latter ſay,</hi> We receive all the Books of the New Teſtament, as they are commonly received, <hi>whereas of them many were doubted?</hi> I anſwer, When they ſay, <hi>of whoſe Authority there was never any doubt in the Church,</hi> They mean not, thoſe only of whoſe Authority there was ſimply no doubt at all, by any man in the Church; But ſuch as were not at any time doubted of by the whole Church, or by all Churches; but had atteſtation, though not univerſal, yet, at leaſt, ſufficient to make conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering men receive them for Canonical.

But, <hi>if to be</hi> commonly received, <hi>paſſe for a good Rule to know the Canon of the New Teſtament by, why not of the Old?</hi> You conclude many times very well, but ſtill when you do ſo, it is out of Principles which no man grant: for, who ever told you, that to be <hi>commonly received</hi> is a good Rule to know the Canon of the New Teſtament by? Have you been trained up in Schools of ſubtilty, and cannot you ſee a great difference between theſe two, We receive the Books of the New Teſtament <hi>as they are</hi> commonly received, and we receive thoſe that are commonly received, <hi>becauſe they are ſo?</hi> To ſay this, were indeed to make, <hi>being commonly received,</hi> a Rule or reaſon to know the Canon by. But to ſay the former, doth no more make it a Rule then you ſhould make the Church of <hi>England</hi> the Rule of your receiving them, if you ſhould ſay, as you may, The Books of the New Teſtament we receive for Canonical, as they are received by the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

If you ſay, <hi>This is Univerſal Tradition:</hi> I reply, your Churches infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility is not built upon it, and that the Canon of Scripture, as we receive it, is. For we do not profeſs our ſelves ſo abſolutely, and undoubtedly certain neither do we urge others to be ſo, of thoſe Books, which have been doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as of thoſe that never have.</p>
                        <p n="46">46. The Concluſion of your Tenth § is, That <hi>the Divinity of a writing cannot be known from it ſelf alone, but by ſome extrinſecal Authority;</hi> Which you need not prove, for no wiſe man denies it. But then, this Authority is that of <hi>Univerſal Tradition,</hi> not of Your Church. For to me it is altogether as <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, that the Goſpel of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> is the Word of God, as that all which your Church ſayes, is true.</p>
                        <p>That Believers of the Scripture, by conſidering the Divine matter, the excellent precepts, the glorious promiſes contained in it, may be confirmed in their faith of the Scriptures Divine Authority; and that among other inducements and enforcements hereunto, internal arguments have their place and force, certainly no man of underſtanding can deny. For my part I profeſſe, if the Doctrine of the Scripture were not as good, and as fit to come from the Fountain of goodneſs, as the Miracles by which it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, were great, I ſhould want one main Pillar of my faith: and for want of it, I fear, ſhould be much ſtagger'd in it. Now this and nothing elſe, did the <hi>Doctor</hi> mean in ſaying, <hi>The Believer ſees, by that glorious Beam of Divine light which ſhines in Scripture, and by many internal Arguments, that the Scripture is of Divine Authority. By this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he ſees it,</hi> that is, he is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to, and ſtrengthened in, his beliefe of it: and by this partly, not wholly;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64345:48"/>by this, not alone, but with the concurrence of other Arguments. He that will quarrel with him for ſaying ſo, muſt finde fault with the <hi>Maſter of the Sentences,</hi> and all his Schollers, for they all ſay the ſame. The reſt of this Paragragh, I am as willing it ſhould be true, as you are to have it: and ſo let it paſſe, as a diſcourſe wherein we are wholly unconcerned. You might have met with an Anſwerer, that would not have ſuffered you to have ſaid ſo much Truth together; but to me it is ſufficient, that it is nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
                        <p n="48">48. In the next Diviſion, out of your liberality, you will ſuppoſe, that Scripture, like to a corporal light, is <hi>by it ſelf alone</hi> able to determine and move our underſtanding to aſſent: yet notwithſtanding this ſuppoſal, <hi>Faith ſtill</hi> (you ſay) <hi>muſt go before Scripture, becauſe as the light is viſible only to thoſe that have eyes: ſo the Scripture, only to thoſe that have the Eye of Faith.</hi> But to my underſtanding, if Scripture do move and determine our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to aſſent, then the Scripture, and its moving, muſt be before this aſſent, as the cauſe muſt be before its own effect; now this very aſſent is nothing elſe but Faith, and Faith nothing elſe than the Underſtanding's aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And therefore (upon this ſuppoſal) Faith doth, and muſt, originally proceed from Scripture, as the effect from its proper cauſe: and the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and efficacy of Scripture is to be preſuppoſed before the aſſent of Faith, unto which it moves and determines, and conſequently if this ſuppoſition of yours were true, there ſhould need no other means precedent to Scripture to beget Faith, Scripture it ſelf being able as here you ſuppoſe) to determine and move the Underſtanding to aſſent, that is, to believe them, and the Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties contained in them. Neither is this to ſay, that the eyes with which we ſee, are made by the light by which we ſee. For you are miſtaken much, if you conceive that in this compariſon, Faith anſwers to the Eye. But if you will not pervert it, the Analogie muſt ſtand thus; Scripture muſt anſwer to light; The eye of the ſoul, that is, the Underſtanding, or the faculty of aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the Bodily eye; And laſtly, aſſenting or believing to the act of See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As therefore the light, determining the Eye to ſee, though it preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Eye which it determines, as every Action doth the object on which it is imployed, yet it ſelf is preſuppos'd and antecedent to the act of ſeeing, as the cauſe is alwaies to its effect: So, if you will ſuppoſe that Scripture, like light, moves the Underſtanding to aſſent, the Underſtanding (that is the eye and object on which it workes) muſt be before this influence upon it; But the Aſſent, that is, the beliefe whereto the Scripture moves and the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is moved, which anſwers to the act of ſeeing, muſt come after. For if it did aſſent already, To what purpoſe ſhould the Scripture do that which was done before? Nay indeed, How were it poſſible it ſhould be ſo, any more than a Father can beget a Son that he hath already? Or an Architect built a houſe that is built already? Or than this very world can be made again before it be unmade? Tranſubſtantion indeed is fruitful of ſuch Monſters. But they that have not ſworn themſelves to the defence of Error, will eaſily perceive, that <hi>jam factum facere,</hi> and <hi>factum infectum facere,</hi> are equally impoſſible. But I digreſs.</p>
                        <p n="49">49. The cloſe of this Paragraph, is a fit cover for ſuch a diſh. There you tell us, That <hi>if there muſt be ſome other means precedent to Scripture to beget faith, this can be no other than the Church.</hi> By the Church, we know you doe, and muſt underſtand the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> ſo that in effect you ſay,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64345:48"/>no man can have faith, but he muſt be moved to it by your Churches Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. And that is to ſay, that the King and all other Proteſtants, to whom you write, though they verily think they are Chriſtians and believe the Goſpel, becauſe they aſſent to the truth of it, and would willingly die for it, yet indeed are Infidels and believe nothing. The Scripture tels us, <hi>The heart of man knoweth no man, but the ſpirit of man which is in him.</hi> And Who are you, to take upon you to make us believe, that we do not believe, what we know we do? But if I may think verily that I believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and yet not believe it; how know you that you believe the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? I am as verily and as ſtrongly perſwaded that I believe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as you are that you believe the Church. And if I may be deceived, why may not you? Again, what more ridiculous, and againſt ſenſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, than to affirm, That there are not millions amongſt you and us that believe, upon no other reaſon than their education, and the authority of their Parents and Teachers, and the opinion they have of them? The tenderneſs of the ſubject, and aptneſs to receive impreſſions, ſupplying the defect and imperfection of the Agent! And will you proſcribe from heaven all thoſe believers of your own Creed, who do indeed lay the foundation of their Faith (for I cannot call it by any other name) no deeper than upon the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of their Father, or Maſter, or Pariſh-Prieſt? Certainly, if theſe have no true faith, your Church is very full of Infidels. Suppoſe <hi>Xaverius</hi> by the holineſs of his life had converted ſome Indians to Chriſtianity, who could (for ſo I will ſuppoſe) have no knowledge of your Church but from him, and therefore muſt laſt of all build their faith of the Church, upon their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Xaverius:</hi> Do theſe remain as very Pagans after their converſion, as they were before? Are they brought to aſſent in their ſouls, and obey in their lives the Goſpel of Chriſt, only to be Tantaliz'd and not ſaved, and not benefited, but deluded by it, becauſe, forſooth, it is a man and not the Church that begets faith in them? What if their motive to believe be not in reaſon ſufficient? Do they therefore not believe what they do believe, becauſe they do it upon inſufficient motives? They chooſe the Faith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently perhaps, but yet they do chooſe it. Unleſs you will have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that that which is done, is not done, becauſe it is not done upon good reaſon: which is to ſay, that never any man living ever did a fooliſh acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But yet I know not why the Authority of one holy man, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently hath no ends upon me, joyn'd with the goodneſs of the Chriſtian faith, might not be a far greater and more rational motive to me to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Chriſtianity, than any I can have to continue in Paganiſm. And therefore, for ſhame, if not for love of Truth, you muſt recant this fancy when you write again: and ſuffer true faith to be many times, where your Churches infallibility hath no hand in the begetting of it. And be content to tell us hereafter, that we believe not enough, and not go about to perſwade us we believe nothing, for fear with telling us what we know to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly falſe, you ſhould gain only this, <hi>Not to be believed when you ſpeak truth.</hi> Some pretty ſophiſms you may haply bring us, to make us believe, we believe nothing: but wiſe men know that Reaſon againſt Experience is alwaies Sophiſtical. And therefore as he that could not anſwer <hi>Zeno's</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties againſt the exiſtence of Motion, could yet confute them by doing that, which he pretended could not be done: So, if you ſhould give me a hundred Arguments to perſwade me, becauſe I do not believe Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64345:49"/>I do not believe in God, and the <hi>Knots</hi> of them I could not unty, yet I ſhould cut them in pieces with doing that, and knowing that I do ſo, which you pretend I cannot do.</p>
                        <p n="50">50. In the thirteenth Diviſion, we have again much ado about nothing. A great deal of ſtir you keep in confuting ſome, <hi>that pretend to know Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Scripture to be ſuch, by the Titles of the Books.</hi> But theſe men you do not name, which makes me ſuſpect you cannot. Yet it is poſſible there may be ſome ſuch men in the world; for <hi>Guſmen de Alfarache</hi> hath taught us that, The Fools hoſpital is a large place.</p>
                        <p n="51">51. In the fourteenth §. we have very artificial jugling. D. <hi>Potter</hi> had ſaid, <hi>That the Scripture</hi> (he deſires to be underſtood of thoſe books wherein all Chriſtians agree) <hi>is a principle, and needs not be proved among Chriſtians.</hi> His reaſon was, becauſe, <hi>that needs no farther proof which is believed already.</hi> Now by this (you ſay) he means either, that the Scripture is one of theſe firſt Principles, and moſt known in all Sciences, which cannot be proved: which is to ſuppoſe, it cannot be proved by the Church; and that is to ſuppoſe the Queſtion: Or, he means, That it is not the moſt known in Chriſtianity, and then it may be proved. Where we ſee plainly, That two moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things, <hi>Moſt known in all Sciences,</hi> and, <hi>Moſt known in Chriſtianity,</hi> are captiouſly confounded. As if the Scripture might not be the firſt and moſt known Principle in Chriſtianity, and yet not the moſt known in all Sciences? Or, as if to be a Firſt Principle <hi>in Chriſtianity,</hi> and <hi>in all Sciences,</hi> were all one? That Scripture is a Principle among Chriſtians, that is, ſo received by all that it need not be proved in any emergent Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie to any Chriſtian, but may be taken for granted, I think few will deny. You your ſelves are of this a ſufficient Teſtimony, for urging againſt us many texts of Scripture, you offer no proof of the truth of them, preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming we will not queſtion it. Yet this is not to deny, that Tradition is a Principle more known than Scripture; But to ſay, It is a Principle not in Chriſtianity, but <hi>in Reaſon,</hi> nor proper to Chriſtians, but common to all men.</p>
                        <p n="52">52. But, <hi>It is repugnant to our practice to hold Scripture a Principle; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are wont to affirm, that one part of Scripture may be known to be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical, and may be interpreted by another.</hi> Where the former device is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain put in practice. For to be known to be <hi>Canonical,</hi> and to be <hi>interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> is not all one. That Scripture may be interpreted by Scripture, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants grant, and Papiſts do not deny; neither does that any way hinder but that this
aſſertion—Scripture is the word of God, may be among Chriſtians a common Principle. But the firſt,—That one part of Scripture may prove another part Canonical, and need no proof of its own being ſo; for that, you have produced divers Proteſtants that deny it; but who they are that affirm it, <hi>nondum conſtat.</hi>

                        <p n="53">53.

Prove your whole doctrine, or the infallibility of your Church by ſuch a Tradition, and we will yield to you in all things. Take the alleaged places of S. <hi>Athanaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in this ſenſe, (which is your own,) and they will not preſs us any thing at all. We will ſay, with <hi>Athanaſius, That only four Goſpels are to be received, becauſe the Canons of the Holy and Catholique Church</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand of <hi>all Ages</hi> ſince the perfection of the Canon) <hi>have ſo determined.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="54">54. We will ſubſcribe to S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and ſay, That <hi>we alſo would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Goſpel, unleſs the Authority of the Catholique Church did move us,</hi> (meaning by the Church, <hi>the Church of all Ages,</hi> and that ſucceſſion of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians which takes in <hi>Chriſt himſelf</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtels.</hi>) Neither would <hi>Zwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius</hi> have needed to cry out upon this ſaying, had he conceived as you now do, that by the Catholique Church, the Church of all Ages, ſince Chriſt, was to be underſtood. As for the Councel of <hi>Carthage,</hi> it may ſpeak not of ſuch Books only, as were certainly Canonical, and for the regulating of Faith; but alſo of thoſe which were only profitable, and lawful to be read in the Church. Which in <hi>England</hi> is a very ſlender Argument that the book is Canonical, where every body knows that Apocryphal books are read as well as Canonical. But howſoever, if you underſtand by Fathers, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their immediate Fathers and Predeceſſors in the Goſpel, but the ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them from the Apoſtles; they are right in the Theſis, that <hi>whatſoever is received from theſe Fathers, as Canonical, is to be ſo eſteemed;</hi> Though in the application of it, to this or that particular book they may haply erre, and think that book received as Canoniel, which was only received as profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to be read; and think that Book received alwaies, and by all, which was rejected by ſome, and doubted of by many.</p>
                        <p n="55">55. <hi>But we cannot be certain, in what language the Scriptures remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted.</hi> Not ſo certain, I grant, as of that which we can demonſtrate: But certain enough, morally certain, as certain as the nature of the thing will bear: So certain we may be, and God requires no more.

And this aſſurance of the Scriptures incorruption, is common to us with him, we therefore are as certain hereof as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was, and that, I hope, was certain enough. Yet if this does not ſatisfie you, I ſay farther, We are as certain hereof as your own <hi>Pope Sixtus Quintus</hi> was.

                        <p n="56">56. This is not all I have to ſay in this matter. For I will add moreover, that we are as certain in what Language the Scripture is uncorrupted, as any man in your Church was, until <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth ſet forth your own approved <hi>Edition of your Vulgar</hi> Tranſlation. For you do not, nor cannot, without extream impudence, deny, that until then, there was great variety of Copes currant in divers parts of your Church, and thoſe very frequent in various lections: all which Copies might poſſibly be falſe in ſome things, but more than one ſort of them, could not poſſibly be true in all things. Neither were it leſs impudence to pretend, that any man in your Church, could until <hi>Clement</hi>'s time have any certainty what that one true Copie and Reading was, (if there were one perfectly true.) Some indeed that had got <hi>Sixtus his Bible,</hi> might, after the Edition of that, very likely think themſelves cock-ſure of a perfect true uncorrupted Tranſlation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being beholding to <hi>Clement;</hi> but how foully they were abuſed and deceived that thought ſo, the Edition of <hi>Clemens,</hi> differing from that of <hi>Sixtus</hi> in a great multitude of places, doth ſufficiently demonſtrate.</p>
                        <p n="57">57. This certainty therefore, in what language the Scripture remains uncorrupted, is it neceſſary to have it, or is it not? If it be not, I hope we may do well enough without it. If it be neceſſary, What became of your Church for 1500 years together? All which time, you muſt confeſs ſhe had no ſuch certainty: no one man being able truly and upon good ground to ſay, <hi>This or that Copy of the Bible is pure, and perfect, and uncorrupted in all things.</hi> And now at this preſent, though ſome of you are grown to a higher degree of Preſumption in this Point, yet are you as far as ever, from any true, real, and rational aſſurance of the abſolute purity of your Authentique Tranſlation: which I ſuppoſe my ſelf to have proved unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably in divers places.</p>
                        <p n="58">58.

For, whenſoever any one, in the firſt times of Chriſtianity, met with a Greek Bible, and ſeemed to himſelf to have ſome ability in both Languages, he preſently ventured upon an Interpretation.</hi> So <hi>He,</hi> in his <hi>ſecond Book of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doctrine. Cap.</hi> 11. Of all theſe, that which was called <hi>the Italian Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was eſteemed beſt; ſo we may learn from the ſame S. <hi>Auſtin in Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>of the ſame Book. Amongſt all theſe interpretations</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>let the Italian
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:64345:50"/>be preferred: for it keeps cloſer to the Letter, and is perſpicuous in the ſenſe.</hi> Yet ſo far was the Church of that time from preſuming upon the abſolute purity and perfection, even of this beſt Tranſlation, that S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> thought it neceſſary to make a new Tranſlation, of the Old Teſtament, out of the Hebrew Fountain, (which himſelf teſtifies in his Book <hi>de Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris illuſtribus</hi>); and to correct the Vulgar verſion of the New Teſtament, according to the truth of the Original Greek; amending many errors which had crept into it, whether by the miſtake of the Author, or the negligence of the Tranſcribers; which work he undertook and performed at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Damaſus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome. You conſtrain me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to make a new work of an old: that, after the Copies of the Scriptures have been diſperſed through the whole World, I ſhould ſit, as it were, an Arbitrator amongst them, and, becauſe they vary among themſelves, ſhould determine what are thoſe things (in them) which conſent with the Greek verity.</hi> And after: <hi>Therefore this preſent Preface promiſes the four Goſpels only, corrected by collation with Greek Copies. But, that they might not be very diſſonant from the cuſtom of the Latin reading, I have ſo tempered with my ſtile, the Tranſlation of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, that, thoſe things amended which did ſeem to change the ſenſe, other things I have ſuffered to remain as they were.</hi> So that in this matter Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants muſt either ſtand or fall with the Primitive Church.</p>
                        <p n="60">60. <hi>The Corruption that you charge</hi> Luther <hi>with, and the falſification that you impute to</hi> Zwinglius, What have we to do with them? Or why may not we as juſtly lay to your charge the Errours, which <hi>Lyranus,</hi> or <hi>Paulus Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſis,</hi> or <hi>Laurentius Valla,</hi> or <hi>Cajetan,</hi> or <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> or <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> or <hi>Auguſtus Nebienſis,</hi> or <hi>Pagnine,</hi> have committed in their Tranſlations?</p>
                        <p n="61">61. Which yet I ſay not, as if theſe Tranſlations of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Zwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius</hi> were abſolutely indefenſible; for what ſuch great difference is there between <hi>Faith without the Works of the Law,</hi> and <hi>Faith alone without the Works of the Law?</hi> Or why does not, <hi>Without, Alone,</hi> ſignifie all one with, <hi>Alone, Without?</hi> Conſider the matter a little better, and obſerve the uſe of theſe phraſes of ſpeech in our ordinary talk, and perhaps you will begin to doubt whether you had ſufficient ground for this invective. And then for <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> if it be true (as they ſay it is) that the language our Saviour ſpake in, had no ſuch word as <hi>Toſignifie,</hi> but uſed always, <hi>to be,</hi> in ſtead of it, as it is certain the Scripture does in an hundred places; then this Tranſlation, which you ſo declaim againſt, will prove no falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> but a calumny in you.</p>
                        <p n="62">62. <hi>But the faith of Proteſtants relies upon Scripture alone; Scripture is delivered to moſt of them by Tranſlations; Tranſlations depend upon the skill and honeſty of Men, who certainly may err becauſe they are Men, and certainly do err, at leaſt ſome of them, becauſe their Tranſlations are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. It ſeems then the Faith, and conſequently the Salvation of Proteſtants, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies upon fallible and uncertain grounds.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="63">63. This Objection, though it may ſeem to do you great ſervice for the preſent; yet I fear, you will repent the time that ever you urged it againſt us as a fault, that we make mens ſalvation <hi>depend upon uncertainties;</hi> For the Objection returns upon you many ways, as firſt thus; The ſalvation of many millions of Papiſts (as they ſuppoſe and teach) depends upon their having the Sacrament of Pennance truly adminiſtred unto them. This again upon the Miniſter's being a true Prieſt. That ſuch or ſuch a man is Prieſt;
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64345:51"/>not himſelf, much leſs any other can have any poſſible certainty: for it depends upon a great many contingent and uncertain ſuppoſals. He that will pretend to be certain of it, muſt undertake to know for a certain all theſe things that follow.</p>
                        <p n="64">64. Firſt, That he was baptized with due matter. Secondly, with the due form of words, (which he cannot know, unleſs he were both preſent and attentive.) Thirdly, he muſt know that he was baptized with due In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and that is, that the Miniſter of his Baptiſm was not a ſecret Jew, nor a Moor, nor an Atheiſt, (of all which kinds, I fear, experience gives you juſt cauſe to fear, that <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> have Prieſts not a few) but a Chriſtian in heart, as well as Profeſſion; (otherwiſe, believing the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be nothing, in giving it he could intend to give nothing,) nor a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſatenian,</hi> nor an <hi>Arrian:</hi> but one that was capable of having due inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from which they that believe not the Doctrine of the Trinity are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by you. And laſtly, That he was neither drunk nor diſtracted at the adminiſtration of the Sacrament, nor our of negligence or malice omitted his intention.</p>
                        <p n="65">65. Fourthly, he muſt undertake to know, that the Biſhop, which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained him Prieſt, ordained him compleatly with due Matter, Form, and Intention: and conſequently, that he again was neither Jew, nor Moor, nor Atheiſt, nor liable to any ſuch exception, as is unconſiſtent with due Intention in giving the Sacrament of Orders.</p>
                        <p n="66">66. Fifthly, he muſt undertake to know, that the Biſhop, which made him Prieſt, was a Prieſt himſelf; for your Rule is, <hi>Nihil dat quod non ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet:</hi> And conſequently, that there was again none of the former nullities in his Baptiſm, which might make him incapable of Ordination; nor no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validity in his Ordination, but a true Prieſt to ordain him again, the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite matter, and form<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and due intention, all concurring.</p>
                        <p n="67">67. Laſtly, he muſt pretend to know the ſame of him that made him Prieſt, and him that made Him Prieſt, even until he comes to the very fountain of Prieſthood. For, take any one in the whole train and ſucceſſion of Ordainers, and ſuppoſe him, by reaſon of any defect, only a ſuppoſed and not a true Prieſt, then according to your Doctrine he could not give a true, but only a ſuppoſed Prieſthood; and they that receive it of him, and again they that derive it from them, can give no better than they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; receiving nothing but a name and ſhadow, can give nothing but a name and ſhadow: and ſo from age to age, from generation to generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeeing equivocal Fathers beget only equivocal Sons; No Principle in Geometry being more certain than this, That <hi>the unſuppliable defect of any neceſſary Antecedent, muſt needs cauſe a nullity of all thoſe Conſequences which depend upon it.</hi> In fine, to know this one thing you muſt firſt know ten thouſand others, whereof not any one is a thing that can be known, there being no neceſſity that it ſhould be true, which only can qualifie any thing for an object of Science, but only, at the beſt, a high degree of probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that it is ſo. But then, that of ten thouſand probables, no one ſhould be falſe; that of ten thouſand requiſites, whereof any one may fail, not one ſhould be wanting, this to me is extreamly improbable and even couſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>german to Impoſſible. So that the aſſurance hereof is like a Machin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of an innumerable multitude of pieces, of which it is ſtrangely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely but ſome will be out of order; and yet, if any one be ſo, the whole
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64345:51"/>Fabrick of neceſſity falls to the ground. And he that ſhall put them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and maturely conſider all the poſſible ways of lapſing, and nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a Prieſthood in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I believe, will be very inclinable to think, that it is an hundred to one, that, amongſt an hundred ſeeming Prieſts, there is not one true one. Nay, that it is not a thing very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that, amongſt thoſe many millions, which make up the Romiſh Hierarchy, there are <hi>not twenty</hi> true. But be the truth in this what it will be, once this is certain, that They, which make mens ſalvation (as you do) depend upon Prieſtly Abſolution; and this again (as you do) upon the Truth and reality of the Prieſthood that gives it; and this laſtly upon a great multitude of apparent uncertainties, are not the fitteſt men in the world, to object to others, as a horrible crime, <hi>That they make mens Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation depend upon fallible and uncertain foundations.</hi> And let this be the firſt retortion of your Argument.</p>
                        <p n="68">68. But ſuppoſe, this difficulty aſſoyled, and that an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhould aſcertain you (for other aſſurances you can have none) that the perſon you make uſe of, is a true Prieſt, and a competent Miniſter of the Sacrament of Pennance; yet ſtill the doubt will remain, Whether he will do you that good which he can do, whether he will pronounce the abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving words with intent to abſolve you! For perhaps, he may bear you ſome ſecret malice, and project to himſelf your damnation, for a compleat Italian revenge. Perhaps (as the tale is of a Prieſt that was lately burnt in <hi>France</hi>) he may upon ſome conditions have compacted with the Devil to give no Sacraments with Intention. Laſtly, he may be (for ought you can poſſibly know) a ſecret Jew, or Moor, or Anti-Trinitarian, or perhaps ſuch a one as is ſo far from intending your forgiveneſs of ſins and ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by this Sacrament, that in his heart he laughs at all theſe things, and thinks Sin nothing, and Salvation a word. All theſe doubts you muſt have clearly reſolved (which can hardly be done but by another Revelation,) before you can upon good grounds aſſure your ſelf, that your true Prieſt gives you true and effectual abſolution. So that when you have done as much as God requires for your Salvation, yet can you by no means be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, but that you may have the ill luck to be damned: which is to make Salvation a matter of chance, and not of choice; and which a man may fail of, not only by an ill life, but by ill fortune. Verily, a moſt comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Doctrine for a conſidering man lying upon his death-bed, who, either feels or fears that his repentance is but attrition only, and not contrition, and conſequently believes, that, if he be not abſolved really by a true Prieſt, he cannot poſſibly eſcape damnation. Such a man for his comfort, you tell, firſt (you that will have <hi>mens ſalvation depend upon no uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>) that though he verily believe that his ſorrow for ſins is a true ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and his purpoſe of amendment a true purpoſe; yet he may deceive himſelf, perhaps it is not; and, if it be not, he muſt be damned. Yet you bid him hope well: But, <hi>Spes eſt rei incertae nomen.</hi> You tell him ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that though the party he confeſſes to, ſeem to be a true Prieſt, yet, for ought he knows, or, for ought himſelf knows, by reaſon of ſome ſecret undiſcern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ble invalidity in his Baptiſm or Ordination, he may be none, and if he be none, he can do nothing. This is a hard ſaying, but this is not the worſt. You tell him thirdly, that he may be in ſuch a ſtate that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, or, if he can, that he will not give the Sacrament with due Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64345:52"/>and, if he does not, all is in vain. Put caſe, a man by theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be caſt into ſome agonies; what advice, what comfort would you give him? Verily, I know not what you could ſay to him, but this; that, firſt for the Qualification required on his part, he might know that he deſired to have true ſorrow, and that that is ſufficient. But then, if he ſhould ask you, Why he might not know his ſorrow to be a true ſorrow, as well as his deſire to be ſorrowful, to be a true deſire; I believe you would be put to ſilence. Then ſecondly, to quiet his fears, concerning the Prieſt and his Intention you ſhould tell him, by my advice, that God's goodneſs (which will not ſuffer him to damn men for not doing better than their beſt,) will ſupply all ſuch defects, as to humane endeavours were unavoidable. And therefore though his Prieſt were indeed no Prieſt, yet to him he ſhould be as if he were one: and if he gave Abſolution without Intention, yet in doing ſo he ſhould hurt himſelf only and not his penitent. This were ſome comfort indeed, and this were to ſettle mens ſalvation upon reaſonable cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain grounds. But this, I fear, you will never ſay; for this were to reverſe many Doctrines eſtabliſhed by your Church; and beſides, to degrade your Prieſthood from a great part of their honour, by leſſening the ſtrict neceſſity of the Laitie's dependance upon them. For it were to ſay, that <hi>the Prieſts Intention is not neceſſary to the obtaining of Abſolution;</hi> which is to ſay, that it is not in the Parſon's power to damn whom he will in his Pariſh, becauſe, by this rule, God ſhould ſupply the defect which his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice had cauſed. And beſides, it were to ſay, that, <hi>Infants dying without Baptiſm might be ſaved,</hi> God ſupplying the want of Baptiſm which to them is unavoidable. But beyond all this, it were to put into my mouth a full and ſatisfying Anſwer to your Argument, which I am now return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo that in anſwering my Objection you ſhould anſwer your own. For then I ſhould tell you, that it were altogether as abhorrent from the goodneſs of God, and as repugnant to it, to ſuffer an ignorant Lay-man's ſoul to periſh, meerly for being miſled by an undiſcernable falſe Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which yet was commended to him by the Church, which (being of neceſſity to credit ſome in this matter) he had reaſon to relie upon, either above all other, or as much as any other, as it is to damn a penitent ſinner for a ſecret defect in that deſired Abſolution, which his Ghoſtly Father perhaps was an Atheiſt, and could not give him, or was a villain and would not. This anſwer therefore, which alone would ſerve to comfort your penitent in his perplexities, and to aſſure him that he cannot fail of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion if he will not, for fear of inconvenience you muſt forbear. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you muſt, I hope you will, come down from the Pulpit, and preach no more againſt others for <hi>making mens Salvation depend upon fallible and uncertain grounds,</hi> leſt by judging others, you make your ſelves, and your own Church inexcuſable, who are ſtrongly guilty of this fault, above all the men and Churches of the World: whereof I have already given you two very pregnant demonſtrations, drawn from your preſumptuous tying God and Salvation to your Sacraments; And the efficacy of them to your Prieſt's Qualifications and Intentions.</p>
                        <p n="69">69. Your making the Salvation of Infants depend on Baptiſm a Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thing, and in the power of man to conferre, or not conferre, would yield me a Third of the ſame nature. And your ſuſpending the ſame on the Baptizer's Intention, a Fourth. And laſtly, your making the Real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64345:52"/>of Chriſt in the Euchariſt depend upon the caſualties of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crator's true Prieſthood and Intention, and yet commanding men to believe it for certain that he is preſent, and to adore the Sacrament, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Doctrine, for ought they can poſſibly know, may be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a piece of Bread, ſo expoſing them to the danger of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and conſequently of damnation, doth offer me a Fifth demonſtration of the ſame Concluſion, if I thought fit to inſiſt upon them. But I have no mind to draw any more out of this Fountain; neither do I think it cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to cloy the Reader with uniformity, when the Subject affords variety.</p>
                        <p n="70">70. Sixthly, therefore, I return it thus. The faith of Papiſts relies alone upon their Churche's infallibility. That there is any Church infallible, and, that Theirs is it, they pretend not to believe, but only upon <hi>pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Motives.</hi> Dependance upon prudential Motives they confeſs to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to a poſſibility of erring. What then remaineth, but Truth, Faith, Salvation, and All, muſt in them relie upon a fallible and uncertain ground!</p>
                        <p n="71">71. Seventhly, The Faith of Papiſts relies upon the Church alone. The Doctrine of the Church is delivered to moſt of them by their Pariſh-Prieſt, or Ghoſtly Father, or, at leaſt, by a company of Prieſts, who, for the moſt part, ſure, are men and not Angels, in whom nothing is more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain than a moſt certain poſſibility to err. What then remaineth, but that Truth, Faith, Salvation, and All, muſt in them relie upon a fallible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain ground.</p>
                        <p n="72">72. Eighthly thus. It is apparent and undeniable, that many Thouſands there are, who believe your Religion upon no better grounds, than a man may have for the belief almoſt of any Religion. As ſome believe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Forefathers did ſo, and they were good People. Some, becauſe they were Chriſtened, and brought up in it. Some, becauſe many Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Religious men are of it. Some, becauſe it is the Religion of their Countrey, where all other Religions are perſecuted and proſcribed. Some, becauſe Proteſtants cannot ſhew a perpetual ſucceſſion of Profeſſors of all their Doctrines. Some, becauſe the ſervice of your Church is more ſtately, and pompous, and magnificent. Some, becauſe they find comfort in it. Some, becauſe your Religion is farther ſpread, and hath more Profeſſors of it, than the Religion of Proteſtants. Some, becauſe <hi>your Prieſts compaſs Sea and Land to gain Proſelytes to it.</hi> Laſtly, an infinite number, by chance, and they know not why, but only becauſe they are ſure they are in the right. This which I ſay, is a moſt certain experimented truth, and, if you will deal ingenuouſly, you will not deny it. And, without queſtion, he that builds his faith upon our <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation,</hi> goes upon a more prudent ground than any of theſe can, with reaſon, be pretended to be. What then can you alledge but that with you, father than with us, Truth, and Faith, and Salvation, and All, relie upon fallible and uncertain grounds?</p>
                        <p n="73">73. Ninthly. Your <hi>Rhemiſh</hi> and <hi>Doway</hi> Tranſlations are delivered to your Proſelytes, (ſuch, I mean, that are diſpenced with, for the reading of them,) for the direction of their Faith and Lives. And the ſame may be ſaid of your Tranſlations of the Bible into other National languages, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of thoſe that are licenced to read them. This, I preſume, you will confeſs. And moreover, that theſe Tranſlations came not by inſpiration, but were the productions of humane Induſtry; and that, not Angels, but men, were the Authors of them. Men, I ſay, meer men, ſubject to the ſame paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64345:53"/>and to the ſame poſſibility of erring with our Tranſlators. And then how does it not unavoidably follow, that in them which depend upon theſe Tranſlations for their direction, Faith, and Truth, and Salvation, and All, relies upon fallible and uncertain grounds?</p>
                        <p n="74">74. Tenthly and laſtly (to lay the ax to the root of the tree) the <hi>Helena</hi> which you ſo fight for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your vulgar Tranſlation, though ſome of you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or pretend to believe it to be in every part and particle of it, the pure and uncorupted Word of God; yet others among you, and thoſe as good and zealous Catholiques as you, are not ſo confident hereof.</p>
                        <p n="75">75. Firſt, for all thoſe who have made Tranſlations of the whole Bible or any part of it different many times in ſenſe from the Vulgar, as <hi>Lyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Cajetan, Pagnine, Arias, Eraſmus, Valla, Steuchus,</hi> and others, it is apparent and even palpable, that they never dreamt of any abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and authentical infallibility of the <hi>Vulgar Tranſlation.</hi> For, if they had, Why did they in many places reject it and differ from it?</p>
                        <p n="76">76. <hi>Vega</hi> was preſent at the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> when that Decree was made, which made the <hi>Vulgar Edition</hi> (then not extant any where in the world) <hi>authentical,</hi> and not to be rejected upon any pretence whatſoever. At the forming this Decree, <hi>Vega</hi> I ſay, was preſent, underſtood the mind of the Councel, as well as any man, and profeſſes that he was inſtructed in it by the <hi>Preſident</hi> of it, the <hi>Cardinal S. Cruce.</hi> And yet he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that <hi>the Councel in this Decree meant to pronounce this Tranſlation free</hi> (not ſimply from all Error) <hi>but only from ſuch Errors, out of which any opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion pernitions to faith and manners might be collected.</hi> This, <hi>And radius</hi> in his defence of that Councel reports of <hi>Vega,</hi> and aſſents to it himſelf. <hi>Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edo,</hi> in his <hi>Book of the Tranſlation of holy Scripture,</hi> hath theſe words ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pregnant and pertinent to the ſame purpoſe; <hi>The See Apoſtolike, hath approved or accepted</hi> Hierom<hi>'s Edition, not as ſo wholly conſonant to the Original, and ſo entire, and pure, and reſtored in all things, that it may not be lawful for any man, either by comparing it with the Fountain to examine it, or, in ſome places to doubt, Whether or no</hi> Hierom <hi>did underſtand the true ſenſe of the Scripture; but only, as an Edition to be preferred before all others then extant, and no where deviating from the Truth in the rules of faith and good life.

From all which it may evidently be collected, that, though ſome of you flatter your ſelves with a vain imagination of the certain abſolute pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and perfection of your Vulgar Edition; yet the matter is not ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and ſo reſolved, but that the beſt learned men amongſt you are often at a ſtand, and very doubtful ſometimes whether your Vulgar Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be true, and ſometimes whether this or that be your Vulgar Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſometimes undoubtedly reſolved that your Vulgar Tranſlation is no true Tranſlation, nor conſonant to the Original, as it was at firſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. And what then can be alledged, but that out of your own grounds it may be inferred and inforced upon you, that not only in your Lay-men, but your Clergy-men and Scholars, Faith, and Truth, and Salvation, and All, depends upon fallible and uncertain grounds? And thus, by ten ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral retortions of this one Argument, I have endeavoured to ſhew you, How ill you have complyed with your own advice, which was <hi>to take heed of urging Arguments that might be returned upon you.</hi> I ſhould now, by a direct Anſwer, ſhew, that it preſſeth not us at all: but I have in paſſing, done it already in the end of the ſecond retortion of this Argument, and thither I refer the Reader.</p>

D. <hi>Covel</hi> commends your Tranſlation and ſo does the <hi>Biſhop of Chicheſter,</hi> and ſo does D. <hi>James,</hi> and ſo do I.

For, to ſay of our Tranſlations, That is the beſt which comes neareſt the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, (and yet it is but one man that ſays ſo,) is not to ſay, it is therefore the beſt becauſe it does ſo. For this may be true by accident, and yet the truth of our Tranſlation no way depend upon the truth of yours. For, had that been their direction, they would not only have made a Tranſlation that ſhould come near to yours, but ſuch a one which ſhould exactly agree with it, and be a Tranſlation of your Tranſlation.</p>

If of obſcure and difficult places, we confeſs we are uncertain of the ſenſe of many of them. But then we ſay there is no neceſſity we ſhould be certain. For, if God's will had been, we ſhould have underſtood him more certainly, he would have ſpoken more plainly. And we ſay beſides, that as we are uncertain, ſo are You too; which he that doubts of, let him read your Commentators upon the Bible, and obſerve their various and diſſonant interpretations, and he ſhall in this point need no further ſatisfaction.</p>
                        <p n="85">85. But ſeeing <hi>there are contentions among us, we are taught by nature and Scripture, and experience</hi> (ſo you tell us out of M. <hi>Hooker to ſeek for the ending of them, by ſubmitting unto ſome Judicial ſentence, whereunto nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part may refuſe to ſtand.</hi> This is very true. Neither ſhould you need to perſwade us to ſeek ſuch a means of ending all our Controverſies, if we could tell where to find it. But this we know, that none is fit to pronounce for all the world a judicial definitive obliging ſentence in Controverſies of Religion, but only ſuch a Man, or ſuch a ſociety of Men, as is authorized thereto by God. And beſides, we are able to demonſtrate, that it hath not been the pleaſure of God to give to any Man, or Society of Men, any ſuch authority. And therefore, though we wiſh heartily that all Controverſies were ended, as we do that all ſin were aboliſht, yet we have little hope of the one, or the other, till the World be ended. And in the mean while, think it beſt to content our ſelves with, and to perſwade others unto, an

But yet it is evident out of his Book, and ſo acknowledged by ſome of your own, That he never thought of any one company of Chriſtians inveſted with ſuch authority from God, that all men were bound to receive their Decrees without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, though they ſeem contrary to Scripture and Reaſon, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> requires. And therefore, if he have in his Preface ſtrained too high in commendation of the Subject he writes of, (as Writers very often do in their Prefaces and Dedicatory Epiſtles) what is that to us?

                        <p n="88">88.

Upon the Tradition of which Church you there told us, <hi>we were to receive the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and to believe it to be the Word of God.</hi> For there you teach us, That <hi>our Faith of Scripture depends on a Principle, which requires no other proof;</hi> And that, <hi>ſuch is Tradition, which, from hand to hand, and age to age, bringing us up to the Times and Perſons of the Apoſtles and our Saviour himſelf, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be confirmed by all thoſe Miracles, and other Arguments whereby they convinced their Doctrin to be true.</hi> Wherefore the Ancient Fathers avouch that we muſt receive the ſacred Scripture upon the Tradition of this Church. The Tradition then of this Church you ſay muſt teach us what is Scripture: and we are willing to believe it. And now, if you make it good unto us, that the ſame Tradition down from the Apoſtles, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from age to age, and from hand to hand, any interpretation of any Scripture, we are ready to embrace that alſo. But now, if you will argue thus: The Church in one ſenſe tells us what is Scripture, and we believe it; therefore, if the Church, taken in another ſenſe, tell us, This or that is the meaning of the Scripture, we are to believe that alſo; this is too tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Sophiſtry, to take any but thoſe that are willing to be taken.</p>

89. If there be any Traditive Interpretation of Scripture, produce it, and prove it to be ſo; and we embrace it. But the Tradition of all ages is one thing; and the Authority of the preſent Church, much more of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which is but a Part, and a corrupted Part, of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, is another.

And conſequently, that the Catholique Church may err in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting from the Canon, Scriptures truly Canonical.</p>
                        <p n="92">92. Secondly, How can we receive the Scripture upon the Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which hath delivered at ſeveral times Scriptures in many places different and repugnant, for Authentical and Canonical? Which is moſt evident out of the place of <hi>Malachy,</hi> which is ſo quoted for the Sacrifice of the Maſs, that either all the ancient Fathers had falſe Bibles, or yours is falſe. Moſt evident likewiſe from the comparing of the ſtory of <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> with that which is cited out of it, in the <hi>Epiſtle to the Hebrews,</hi> according to the vulgar Edition. But above all, to any one who ſhall compare the Bibles of <hi>Sixtus</hi> and <hi>Clement,</hi> ſo evident, that the wit of man cannot diſguiſe it.</p>
                        <p n="93">93. And thus you ſee what reaſon we have to believe your Antecedent, <hi>That your Church it is which muſt declare, what Books be true Scripture.</hi> Now, for the conſequence, that certainly is as liable to exception as the Antecedent. For, if it were true, that God had promiſed to aſſiſt you, for the delivering of true Scripture, would this oblige Him, or would it follow from hence that He had obliged himſelf, to teach you, not only ſufficiently, but <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually</hi> and <hi>irreſiſtibly</hi> the true ſenſe of Scripture? God is not defective in things neceſſary: neither will he leave himſelf without witneſs, nor the World without means of knowing his will and doing it. And therefore it was neceſſary that by his Providence he ſhould preſerve the Scripture
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64345:55"/>from any undiſcernable corruption, in thoſe things which he would have known: otherwiſe it is apparent, it had not been his will, that theſe things ſhould be known, the only means of continuing the knowledge of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing periſhed. But now neither is God laviſh in ſuperfluities, and therefore having given us means ſufficient for our direction, and power ſufficient to make uſe of theſe means, he will not conſtrain or neceſſitate us to make uſe of theſe means. For that were to croſs the end of our Creation, which was to be glorified by our free obedience: whereas Neceſſity and Freedom cannot ſtand together. That were to reverſe the Law which he hath preſcribed to himſelf in his dealing with Man; and that is, <hi>to ſet life and death before him, and to leave him in the hands of his own Counſel.</hi> God gave the Wiſemen a Star to lead them to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but he did not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate them to follow the guidance of this Star: that was left to their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. God gave the Children of <hi>Iſrael a Fire to lead them by night, and a Pillar of Cloud by day;</hi> but he conſtrained no man to follow them: that was left to their liberty. So he gives the Church the Scripture: which in thoſe things which are to be believed or done, are plain and eaſie to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, like the Wiſemen's Star. Now that, which he deſires of us on our part, is, the Obedience of Faith, and love of the Truth, and deſire to find the true ſenſe of it, and induſtry in ſearching it, and humility in following, and Conſtancy in profeſſing it: all which, if he ſhould work in us by an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute irreſiſtible neceſſity, he could no more require of us as our duty, than he can of the Sun to ſhine, of the Sea to ebb and flow, and of all other Creatures to do thoſe things which by meer neceſſity, they muſt do, and cannot chuſe. Beſides, What an impudence is it to pretend that <hi>your Church is infallibly directed concerning the true meaning of the Scripture,</hi> whereas there are thouſands of places of Scripture, which you do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend certainly to underſtand, and about the Interpretation whereof, your own Doctors differ among themſelves? If your Church be infallibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected concerning the true meaning of Scripture, why do not your Doctors follow her infallible direction? And, if they do, How comes ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among them in their Interpretations?</p>
                        <p n="94">94. Again, Why does your Church thus put her Candle under a Buſhel, and keep her Talent of interpreting Scripture infallibly, thus long wrapt up in napkins? Why ſets ſhe not forth Infallible Commentaries or Expoſitions upon all the Bible? Is it, becauſe this would not be profitable for Chriſtians, that Scripture ſhould be interpreted? It is blaſphemous to ſay ſo. The Scripture it ſelf tells us, <hi>All Scripture is profitable.</hi> And the Scripture is not ſo much the Words as the Senſe. And, if it be not profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, Why does ſhe imploy particular Doctors to interpret Scriptures fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly? unleſs we muſt think that fallible interpretations of Scripture are profitable, and infallible interpretations would not be ſo?</p>
                        <p n="95">95. If you ſay, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt, which aſsiſts the Church in interpreting, will move the Church to interpret when he ſhall think fit, and that the Church will do it when the Holy Ghoſt ſhall move her to do it.</hi> I demand, Whether the Holy Ghoſt's moving of the Church to ſuch works as theſe, be reſiſtible by the Church, or irreſiſtible. If reſiſtible, then the Holy Ghoſt may move, and the Church may not be moved. As certainly the Holy Ghoſt doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways move to an action, when he ſhews us plainly, that it would be for the good of men, and honour of God: As he that hath any ſenſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64345:56"/>will acknowledge that an infallible expoſition of Scripture could not but be; and there is no conceivable reaſon, Why ſuch a work ſhould be put off a day, but only becauſe you are conſcious to your ſelves, you cannot do it, and therefore make excuſes. But if the moving of the Holy Ghoſt be irreſiſtible, and you are not yet ſo moved to go about this work; then I confeſs you are excuſed. But then I would know, Whether thoſe Popes, which ſo long deferred the calling of a Councel for the Reformation of your Church, at length pretended to be effected by the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> whether they may excuſe themſelves, for that they were not moved by the Holy Ghoſt to do it? I would know likewiſe, as this motion is irreſiſtible when it comes, ſo whether it be ſo ſimply neceſſary to the moving of your Church to any ſuch publique Action, that it cannot poſſibly move with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it? That is, Whether the Pope now could not, if he would, ſeat him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>in Cathedra,</hi> and fall to writing Expoſitions upon the Bible for the direction of Chriſtians to the true ſenſe of it? If you ſay, He cannot, you will make your ſelf ridiculous. If he can, then I would know, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould be infallibly directed in theſe Expoſitions, or no? If he ſhould, then what need he to ſtay for irreſiſible motion? Why does he not go about this noble work preſently? If he ſhould not, How ſhall we know that the calling of the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> was not upon his own volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary motion, or upon humane importunity and ſuggeſtion, and not upon the motion of the Holy Ghoſt? And conſequently, How ſhall we know whether he were aſſiſtant to it or no, ſeeing He aſſiſts none but what He himſelf moves to? And whether He did move the Pope to call this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, is a ſecret thing, which we cannot poſſibly know, nor perhaps the Pope himſelf.</p>
                        <p n="96">96. If you ſay, your meaning is only, <hi>That the Church ſhall be infallibly guarded from giving any falſe ſenſe of any Scripture, and not infallibly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted poſitively to give the true ſenſe of all Scripture:</hi> I put to you your own Queſtion, Why ſhould we believe the Holy Ghoſt will ſtay there? Or, Why may we not as well think he will ſtay at the firſt thing, that is, in teaching the Church what Books be true Scripture? For, if the Holy Ghoſt's aſſiſtance be promiſed to all things profitable, then will he be with them infallibly, not only to guard them from all Errors, but to guide them to all profitable truths, ſuch as the true ſenſes of all Scripture would be. Neither could he ſtay there, but defend them irreſiſtibly from all Vices; Nor there neither, but infuſe into them irreſiſtibly all Vertues: for all theſe things would be much for the benefit of Chriſtians. If you ſay, he cannot do this without taking away their freewill in living; I ſay, neither can he neceſſitate men to believe aright, without taking away their free-will in believing, and in profeſſing their belief.</p>
                        <p n="97">97. To the place of S. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> I anſwer, That, not the Authority of the preſent Church, much leſs of a Part of it (as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is) was that which alone moved S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to believe the Goſpel, but the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Tradition of the Church of all Ages. Which you your ſelf have taught us to be the <hi>only Principle by which the Scripture is proved, and which it ſelf needs no proof;</hi> and to which you have referred this very Saying of Saint <hi>Auſtin, Ego verò Evangelio non crederem, niſi, &amp;c.

                           <pb n="79" facs="tcp:64345:56"/>And ſeeing this Tradition, this Conſent, this Antiquity did as fully and powerfully move him not to believe <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> as to believe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, (the Chriſtian Tradition being as full againſt <hi>Manichaeus</hi> as it was for the Goſpel) therefore he did well to conclude upon theſe grounds, that he had as much reaſon to diſ-believe <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> as to believe the Goſpel. Now, if you can truly ſay, that the ſame Fame, Celebrity, Conſent, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, that the ſame Univerſal and Original Tradition, lies againſt <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> as did againſt <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> you may do well to apply the Argument againſt them; otherwiſe it will be to little purpoſe to ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute their names inſtead of <hi>Manichaeus,</hi> unleſs you can ſhew the thing agrees to them as well as him.</p>
                        <p n="98">98.

I anſwer, Firſt, That it is a vain preſumption of yours that the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church is of your ſide.</hi> Secondly, that, if S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeak here of that preſent Church, which moved him to believe the Goſpel, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Antiquity of it, and its both Perſonal and Doctrinal ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from the Apoſtles; his Argument will be like a <hi>Buskin</hi> that will ſerve any leg. It will ſerve to keep an <hi>Arrian,</hi> or a <hi>Grecian,</hi> from being a <hi>Roman Catholique,</hi> as well as a Catholique from being an <hi>Arrian,</hi> or a <hi>Grecian:</hi> In as much as the <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> did pretend to the title of Catholiques, and The Church, as much as the Papiſts now do. If then you ſhould have come to an ancient <hi>Goth</hi> or <hi>Vandal,</hi> whom the <hi>Arrians</hi> converted to Chriſtianity, and ſhould have moved him to your Religion; might he not ſay the very ſame words to you as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to the <hi>Manichae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? I would not believe the Goſpel, unleſs the Authority of the Church did move me. Them therefore whom I obeyed, ſaying, Believe the Goſpel, why ſhould I not obey ſaying to me, Do not believe the</hi> Homo-ouſians? <hi>Chuſe what thou pleaſeſt: If thou ſhalt ſay, Believe the</hi> Arrians, <hi>they warn me not to give any credit to you.

Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til you can ſhew that Proteſtants believe that Chriſt commanded any good thing, that is, That they believe the Truth of Chriſtian Religion upon the Authority of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> this place muſt be wholly impertinent to your purpoſe; which is to make Proteſtants believe your Church to be the infallible Expounder of Scriptures and Judg of Controverſies: Nay rather, is it not directly againſt your purpoſe? For why may not a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who received his Baptiſm, Education, and Faith from the Miniſtery of this Church, ſay juſt ſo to you as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> here to the <hi>Manichees?</hi> Why ſhould I not moſt diligently enquire, what Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of them (the Church of <hi>England</hi>) before all others, by whoſe Authority I was moved to believe, that Chriſt commanded any good thing? Can you, F. or K. or whoſoever you are, better declare to me what he ſaid, whom I would not have thought to have been, or to be, if the belief thereof had been recommended by you to me? This therefore (that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> did thoſe Miracles, and taught that Doctrine which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained evidently in the undoubted Books of the New Teſtament) I believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Fame, ſtrengthened with Celebrity and Conſent, (even of thoſe which in other things are at infinite variance one with another,) and laſtly by Antiquity (which gives an univerſal and a conſtant atteſtation to them.) But every one may ſee that you, ſo few in compariſon of all thoſe upon whoſe conſent we ground our belief of Scripture,) ſo turbulent, (that you damn all to the fire, and to Hell, that any way differ from you; that you profeſs it is lawful for you, to uſe violence and power whenſoever you can have it, for the planting of your own Doctrine, and the extirpation of the contrary;) Laſtly, ſo new in many of your Doctrines, (as in the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and expedience of debarring the Laity the Sacramental Cup; the lawfulneſs and expedience of your Latine Service, Tranſubſtantiation, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, Purgatory, the Pope's Infallibility, his Authority over Kings, &amp;c. So new, I ſay, in compariſon of the undoubted Books of Scripture, which evidently containeth, or rather is our Religion, and the ſole, and adequate object of our faith: I ſay, every one may ſee that you, ſo few, ſo turbulent, ſo new, can produce nothing deſerving Authority (with wiſe and conſiderate men.) What madneſs is this? Believe then the conſent of Chriſtians, which are now, and have been ever ſince Chriſt in the World, that we ought to believe Chriſt; but learn of us what Chriſt ſaid, which contradict and damn all other parts of Chriſtendom. Why, I beſeech you? Surely, if they were not at all, and could not teach me any thing, I would more eaſily perſwade my ſelf, that I were not to believe in Chriſt, than that I ſhould learn any thing concerning him, from any other, than them by whom I believed him: at leaſt, than that I ſhould learn what his Religion was from you, who have wronged ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly

For, if you take this Authority upon you, upon the ſix Ages laſt paſt; how ſhall we know, that the Church of that time, did not uſurp the ſame Authority upon the Authors of the ſix laſt Ages before them, and ſo upwards, until we come to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Whoſe queſtioned Doctrines, none of them came from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Apoſtolike Tradition, but have inſinuated themſelves into the Streams, by little and little; ſome in one age, and ſome in another; ſome more anciently, ſome more lately; and ſome yet are Embrio's, yet hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in the ſhell; as the Pope's infallibility, the bleſſed Virgin's imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Conception, the Pope's power over the Temporalties of Kings, the Doctrine of Predetermination, &amp;c. all which yet are, or in time may be, impoſed upon Chriſtians under the Title of <hi>Original and Apoſtolike Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;</hi> and that with that neceſſity, that they are told, they were as good believe nothing at all, as not believe theſe things to have come from the Apoſtles, which they know to have been brought in but yeſterday: which whether it be not a ready and likely way to make men conclude thus with themſelves—I am told, that I were as good believe nothing at all, as believe ſome points which the Church teacheth me, and not others: and ſome things which ſhe teacheth to be Ancient and Certain, I plainly ſee to be New and Falſe; therefore I will believe nothing at all. Whether, I ſay, the foreſaid grounds be not a ready and likely way to make men conclude thus; and whether this Concluſion be not too often made in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and in <hi>England</hi> too, I leave it to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe that have wiſdom and experience. Seeing therefore the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church is ſo far from being a ſufficient Foundation for our Belief in Chriſt, that it is in ſundry regards a dangerous temptation againſt it; why ſhould I not much rather conclude, Seeing we receive not the knowledg of Chriſt and Scriptures from the Church of <hi>Rom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But ſpeaking truly and properly, the Scripture is not a Judge, nor cannot be, but only a <hi>ſufficient Rule,</hi> for thoſe to judge by, that believe it to be the Word of God (as the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> both do,) what they are to believe, and what they are not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. I ſay ſufficiently perfect, and ſufficiently intelligible, in things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to all that have underſtanding, whether they be learned or unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And my reaſon hereof is convincing and Demonſtrative; becauſe nothing is neceſſary to be believed, but what is plainly revealed. For to ſay, that when a place of Scripture, by reaſon of ambiguous terms, lies indifferent between divers ſenſes, whereof one is true, and the other is falſe, that God obliges men under pain of damnation, not to miſtake through error and humane frailty, is to make God a Tyrant; and to ſay that he requires us certainly to attain that end, for the attaining whereof we have no certain means: which is to ſay, that, like <hi>Pharoah,</hi> he gives no ſtraw, and requires brick; that he reaps where he ſows not; that he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers where he ſtrews not; that he will not be pleaſed with our utmoſt endeavours to pleaſe him, without full, and exact, and never failing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; that his will is, we ſhould do what he knows we cannot do; that he will not accept of us according to that which we have, but requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of us what we have not. Which, Whether it can conſiſt with his goodneſs, with his wiſdom, and with his word, I leave it to honeſt men to judge. If I ſhould ſend a ſervant to <hi>Paris,</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and he uſing his utmoſt diligence not to miſtake his way, yet notwithſtanding, meeting often with ſuch places where the road is divided into ſeveral wayes, whereof every one is as likely to be true, and as likely to be falſe as any other, ſhould at length miſtake and go out of the way; Would not any man ſay that I were an impotent, fooliſh and unjuſt Maſter, if I impute that to God, which we would take in foul ſcorn, if it were impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to our ſelves? Certainly, I, for my part, fear, I ſhould not love God, if I ſhould think ſo ſtrangely of him.</p>
                        <p n="105">105. Again, when you ſay, <hi>That unlearned and ignorant men cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Scripture,</hi> I would deſire you to come out of the Clouds, and tell us what you mean: Whether, that they cannot underſtand all Scripture, or that they cannot underſtand any Scripture, or that they cannot underſtand ſo much as is ſufficient for their direction to heaven. If the firſt, I believe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64345:58"/>the Learned are in the ſame caſe. If the ſecond, Every man's experience will confute you: for, Who is there that is not capable of a ſufficient under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Story, the Precepts, the Promiſes, and the Threats of the Goſpel? If the third, that they may underſtand ſomething, but not enough for their Salvations; I ask you, firſt, Why then doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, The Scriptures are able to make him wiſe unto Salvation?</hi> Why doth Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſay, <hi>Ea quae manifeſtè poſita ſunt in ſacris Scripturis, omnia continent quae pertinent ad Fidem, Moreſque vivendi?</hi> Why does every one of the four Evangeliſts intitle their Book <hi>The Goſpel,</hi> if any neceſſary and eſſential part of the Goſpel were left out of it? Can we imagine, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they omitted ſomething neceſſary, out of ignorance not knowing it to be neceſſary? Or, knowing it to be ſo, maliciouſly concealed it? Or, out of negligence, did the work they have undertaken by halfs? If none of theſe things can without Blaſphemy be imputed to them, conſidering they were aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt in this work, then certainly it moſt evidently follows, that every one of them writ the whole Goſpel of Chriſt; I mean, all the eſſential and neceſſary parts of it. So that, if we had no other Book of Scripture, but one of them alone, we ſhould not want any thing neceſſary to Salvation. And what one of them hath more than another, it is only profitable and not neceſſary. Neceſſary indeed to be believed, becauſe revealed; but not therefore revealed, becauſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be believed.</p>
                        <p n="106">106. Neither did they write only for the learned, but for all men. This being one eſpecial means of the preaching of the Goſpel, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be preached, not only to learned men, but <hi>to all men.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, unleſs we will imagine the Holy Ghoſt and them, to have been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully wanting to their own deſire and purpoſe, we muſt conceive, that they intended to ſpeak plain, even to the capacity of the ſimpleſt; at leaſt, touching all things neceſſary to be publiſhed by them, and believed by us.</p>
                        <p n="107">107. And whereas you pretend it <hi>is ſo eaſie, and obvious both for the learned and the ignorant, both to know, Which is the Church, and what are the Decrees of the Church, and what is the ſenſe of thoſe Decrees:</hi> I ſay, this is a vain pretence.</p>
                        <p n="108">108. For firſt, How ſhall an unlearned man whom you have ſuppoſed now ignorant of Scripture, how ſhall he know which of all the Societies of Chriſtians is indeed the Church? You will ſay perhaps, <hi>He muſt examine them by the notes of the Church, which are, perpetual Viſibility, Succeſsion, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with the Ancient Church,</hi> &amp;c. But how ſhall he know, firſt, that theſe are the notes of the Church, unleſs by Scripture, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>, you ſay, he underſtands not? You may ſay perhaps, he may be told ſo. But ſeeing men may deceive, and be deceived, and their words are no demonſtrations, How ſhall he be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that what they ſay is true? So that at the firſt he meets with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable difficulty, and cannot know the Church but by ſuch notes, which whether they be the notes of the Church he cannot poſſibly know. But let us ſuppoſe this <hi>Iſthmus</hi> digged through, and that he is aſſured, Theſe are the notes of the true Church: How can he poſſibly be a competent Judge, Which ſociety of Chriſtians hath title to theſe notes, and which hath not? Seeing this trial of neceſſity requires a great ſufficiency of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the monuments of Chriſtian Antiquity, which no unlearned man
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64345:59"/>can have, becauſe he that hath it cannot be unlearned. As for example, how ſhall he poſſibly be able to know whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath had a perpetual Succeſſion of Viſible Profeſſors, which held alwayes the ſame Doctrin which they now hold, without holding any thing to the contrary; unleſs he hath firſt examined, what was the Doctrin of the Church in the firſt age, what in the ſecond, and ſo forth? And whether this be not a more difficult work, than to ſtay at the firſt Age, and to examine the Church by the conformity of her Doctrine with the Doctrin of the firſt Age, every man of ordinary underſtanding may judge.</p>
                        <p n="108">108. Let us imagine him advanc'd a ſtep farther, and to know which is the Church: how ſhall he know what that Church hath decreed, ſeeing the Church hath not been ſo careful in keeping of her decrees, but that many are loſt, and many corrupted? Beſides, when even the Learned among you are not agreed concerning divers things, whether they be <hi>De fide,</hi> or not, how ſhall the unlearned do? Then for the ſenſe of the Decrees, how can he be more capable of the underſtanding of them, than of plain Texts of Scripture, which you will not ſuffer him to underſtand? Eſpecially, ſeeing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of divers Popes and Councels are conceived ſo obſcurely, that the Learned cannot agree about the ſenſe of them. And then they are written all in ſuch languages which the ignorant underſtand not, and therefore muſt of neceſſity rely herein, upon the uncertain and fallible authority of ſome particular men, who inform them that there is ſuch a Decree. And if the Decrees were tranſlated into Vulgar Languages, why the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſhould not be as infallible as you ſay the Tranſlators of Scripture are, who can poſſibly imagine?</p>
                        <p n="109">109. Laſtly, how ſhall an unlearned man, or indeed any man, be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the certainty of that Decree, the certainty whereof depends upon ſuppoſitions which are impoſſible to be known whether they be true or no? For, it is not the Decree of a Councel, unleſs it be confirmed by a true Pope. Now the Pope cannot be a true Pope, if he came in by Simony: which whether he did or no, who can anſwer me? He cannot be a true Pope unleſs he were baptized, and baptized he was not, unleſs the Miniſter had due Intention. So likewiſe he cannot be a true Pope, unleſſe he were rightly ordained Prieſt, and that again depends upon the Ordainer's ſecret Intention, and alſo upon his having the Epiſcopal Character. All which things, as I have formerly proved, depend upon ſo many uncertain ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, that no humane judgement can poſſibly be reſolved in them. I conclude therefore, that not the learnedſt man amongſt you all, no not the Pope himſelf, can, according to the grounds you go upon, have any certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that any Decree of any Councel is good and valid, and conſequently, not any aſſurance that it is indeed the Decree of a Councel.</p>
                        <p n="110">110. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 20. If by a <hi>private ſpirit,</hi> you mean, a particular perſwaſion that a Doctrin is true, which ſome men pretend, but cannot prove to come from the Spirit of God: I ſay, to refer Controverſies to Scripture, is not to refer them to this kind of private Spirit. For is there not a manifeſt difference between ſaying, <hi>The Spirit of God tels me that this is the meaning of ſuch a Text</hi> (which no man can poſſibly know to be true, it being a ſecret thing) and between ſaying, <hi>Theſe and theſe reaſons I have to ſhew, that this or that is true Doctrin, or that this or that is the meaning of ſuch a Scripture?</hi> Reaſon being a Publique and certain thing, and expoſed to all mens tryal and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64345:59"/>examination. But now, if by <hi>private ſpirit</hi> you underſtand every mans par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reaſon, then your firſt and ſecond inconvenience will preſently be reduced to one, and ſhortly to none at all.</p>
                        <p n="111">111. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 20. And does not alſo giving the office of Judicature to the Church, come to confert it upon every particular man? For, before any man believes the Church infallible, muſt he not have reaſon to induce him to believe it to be ſo? And, muſt he not judge of thoſe reaſons, whether they be indeed good and firm, or captious and ſophiſtical? Or, would you have all men believe all your Doctrin upon the Churches Infallibility, and the Churches Infallibility they know not why?</p>
                        <p n="112">112. Secondly, ſuppoſing they are to be guided by the Church, they muſt uſe their own particular reaſon to find out which is the Church. And to that purpoſe, you your ſelves give a great many notes, which you pretend firſt to be Certain notes of the Church, and then to be Peculiar to your Church, and agreeable to none elſe; but you do not ſo much as pretend, that either of thoſe pretences is evident of it ſelf, and therefore you go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to prove them both by reaſons; and thoſe reaſons, I hope, every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man is to judge of, whether they do indeed conclude and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince that which they are alledged for: that is, that theſe marks are indeed certain notes of the Church; and then, that your Church hath them, and no other.</p>
                        <p n="113">113. One of theſe notes, indeed the only note of a true and uncorrupted Church, is Conformity with Antiquity; I mean, the moſt ancient Church of all, that is the Primitive and Apoſtolique. Now, how is it poſſible any man ſhould examine your Church by this note, but he muſt by his own particular judgement, find out what was the Doctrin of the Primitive Church, and what is the Doctrin of the preſent Church, and be able to anſwer all theſe Arguments which are brought to prove repugnance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them? otherwiſe, he ſhall but pretend to make uſe of this note for the finding the true Church, but indeed make no uſe of it, but receive the Church at a venture, as the moſt of you do; not one in a hundered being able to give any tolerable reaſon for it. So that in ſtead of reducing them to particular reaſons, you reduce them to none at all, but to chance, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and prejudice, and ſuch other wayes; which, if they lead one to the truth, they lead hundreds, nay thouſands to falſhood. But it is a pretty thing to conſider, how theſe men can blow hot and cold out of the ſame mouth to ſerve ſeveral purpoſes. Is there hope of gaining a Proſelyte? Then they will tell you, God hath given every man Reaſon to follow; and if the blind lead the blind, both ſhall fall into the Ditch. That it is no good reaſon for a mans Religion, that he was born and brought up in it: For then a Turk ſhould have as much reaſon to be a Turk, as a Chriſtian to be a Chriſtian. That every man hath a judgment of Diſcretion; which if they will make uſe of, they ſhall eaſily find, that the true Church hath alwayes ſuch and ſuch marks, and that their Church hath them, and no other but theirs. But then if any of theirs be perſwaded to a ſincere and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient tryal of their Church, even by their own notes of it, and to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be indeed ſo conformable to Antiquity as they pretend, then their note is changed, You muſt not uſe your own reaſon, nor your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but referr all to the Church, and believe her to be conformable to Antiquity, though they have no reaſon for it, nay though they have evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64345:60"/>reaſon to the contrary. For my part, I am certain that God hath given us our Reaſon, to diſcern between Truth and Falſhood, and he that makes not this uſe of it, but believes things he knows not why; I ſay, it is by chance that he believes the truth, and not by choice: and that I cannot but fear, that God will not accept of this <hi>Sacrifice of fools.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="114">114. But you that would not have men follow their Reaſon, what would you have them to follow? their Paſſion? Or pluck out their eyes and go blindfold? <hi>No,</hi> you ſay, <hi>you would have them follow Authority.</hi> On God's name let them; we alſo would have them follow Authority; for it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Authority of Univerſal Tradition, that we would have them believe Scripture. But then as for the Authority which you would have them follow, you will let them ſee reaſon why they ſhould follow it. And is not this to go a little about? to leave Reaſon for a ſhort turn, and then to come to it again; and to do that which you condemn in others? It being indeed a plain impoſſibility for any man to ſubmit his reaſon but to Reaſon: for he that doth it to Authority, muſt of neceſſity think himſelf to have greater reaſon to believe that Authority. Therefore the confeſſion cited by <hi>Breerely</hi> you need not think to have been extorted from <hi>Luther</hi> and the reſt. It came very freely from them, and what they ſay, you practiſe as much as they.</p>
                        <p n="115">115. And whereas you ſay that a <hi>Proteſtant admits of Fathers, Councels, Church, as farr as they agree with Scripture, which upon the matter is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:</hi> I ſay, you admit neither of them, nor the Scripture it ſelf, but only ſo far as it agrees with your Church: and your Church you admit, becauſe you think you have reaſon to do ſo: ſo that by you as well as by Proteſtants all is finally reſolved into your own reaſon.</p>
                        <p n="116">116 Nor do Heretiques only, but <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholiques alſo, ſet up as many Judges, as there are men and women in the Chriſtian world. For do not your men and women judge your Religion to be true, before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, as well as the men and women of other Religions? Oh but, you ſay, <hi>They receive it, not becauſe they think it agreeable to Scripture, but becauſe the Church tels them ſo.</hi> But then, I hope, they believe the Church, becauſe their own reaſon tels them they are to do ſo. So that the difference between a Papiſt and a Proteſtant is this, not that the one judges and the other does not judge, but that the one judges his guide to be infallible, the other his way to be manifeſt. <hi>This ſame pernitious Doctrin is taught by</hi> Brentius, Zanchius, Cartwright, <hi>and others.</hi> It is ſo, in very deed: But it is taught alſo by ſome others, whom you little think of. It is taught by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> where he ſayes, <hi>Try all things, hold faſt that which is good.</hi> It is taught by S. <hi>John,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they be of God or no.</hi> It is taught by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> in theſe, <hi>Be ye ready to render a reaſon of the hope that is in you.</hi> Laſtly, this very pernitious Doctrin is taught by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>If the blind lead the blind, both ſhall fall into the ditch.</hi> And, <hi>Why of your ſelves judge you not what is right?</hi> All which ſpeeches, if they do not adviſe men to make uſe of their Reaſon for the choice of their Religion, I muſt confeſs my ſelf to underſtand nothing. Laſtly, not to be infinite, it is taught by M. <hi>Knot</hi> himſelf, not in one page only, or chapter of his <hi>Book,</hi> but all his Book over; the very writing and publiſhing whereof, ſuppoſeth this for certain, that the Readers are to be Judges, whether his Reaſons which he brings, be ſtrong and convincing, of which ſort we have hitherto met with none: or elſe captious, or impertinences, as indifferent men ſhall (as I ſuppoſe) have cauſe to judge them.</p>

For Gods ſake, Sir, tell me plainly; In thoſe Texts of Scripture, which you alledge for the Infallibility of your Church, do you not allow what ſenſe you think true, and diſallow the contrary? And do not you this, by the direction of your private reaſon? If you do, why do you condemn it in others? If you do not, I pray you tell me what direction you follow? or whether you follow none at all? If none at all, this is like drawing Lots, or throwing the Dice for the choice of a Religion. If any other, I beſeech you tell me what it is. Perhaps you will ſay, <hi>the Churches Authority;</hi> and that will be to dance finely in a round, thus, To believe the Churches infallible Authority, becauſe the Scriptures avouch it; and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Scriptures ſay and mean ſo, becauſe they are ſo expounded by the Church. Is not this for a Father to beget his Son, and the Son to beget his Father? For a foundation to ſupport the houſe, and the houſe to ſupport the foundation? Would not <hi>Campian</hi> have cryed out at it, <hi>Ecce quos gyros, quos Maeandros?</hi> And to what end was this going about, when you might as well at firſt have concluded the Church infallible, becauſe ſhe ſayes ſo; as thus to put in Scripture for a meer ſtale, and to ſay the Church is infallible becauſe the Scripture ſayes ſo, and the Scripture means ſo, becauſe the Church ſayes ſo, which is infallible? Is it not moſt evident therefore to every intelligent man, that you are enforced of neceſſity to do that your ſelf, which ſo tragically you declaim againſt in others? The Church, you ſay, is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible; I am very doubtful of it: How ſhall I know it? The Scripture you ſay, affirms it, as in the 59. of <hi>Eſay, My ſpirit that is in thee, &amp;c.</hi> Well, I confeſs I find there theſe words: but I am ſtill doubtful, whether they be ſpoken of the Church of Chriſt: and if they be, whether they mean as you
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64345:61"/>pretend. You ſay, the Church ſaies ſo, which is infallible. Yea, but that is the Queſtion; and therefore not to be begg'd, but proved. Neither is it ſo evident as to need no proof: otherwiſe, why brought you this Text to prove it? Nor is it of ſuch a ſtrange quality, above all other Propoſitions, as to be able to prove it ſelf. What then remains but that you ſay, Reaſons drawn out of the Circumſtances of the Text, will evince that this is the ſenſe of it. Perhaps they will. But reaſons cannot convince me, unleſs I judge of them by my Reaſon; and, for every man or woman to rely on that, in the choice of their Religion, and in the interpreting of Scripture, you ſay, is a horrible abſurdity; and therefore muſt neither make uſe of your own in this matter, nor deſire me to make uſe of it.</p>

But that it hath, I hope you would not have me take upon your word; for that were to build my ſelf upon the Church, and the Church upon You. Let then the Tradition ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; for a ſecret Tradition is ſomewhat like a ſilent Thunder. You will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps produce, for the confirmation of it, ſome ſayings of ſome Fathers, who in every Age taught this Doctrin; (as <hi>Gualterius</hi> in his Chronologie under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to do, but with ſo ill ſucceſs, that I heard an able Man of your Religion profeſs, that <hi>in the firſt three Centuries, there was not one Authority pertinent:</hi>) but how will you warrant that none of them teach the contrary? Again, how ſhall I be aſſured that the places have indeed this ſenſe in them? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is not one Father for 500. years after Chriſt, that does ſay in plain termes, <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is infallible.</hi> What, ſhall we believe your Church that this is their meaning? But this will be again to go into the Circle, which made us giddy before; To prove the Church Infallible, becauſe Tradition ſaies ſo; Tradition to ſay ſo, becauſe the Fathers ſay ſo; The Fathers to ſay ſo, becauſe the Church ſaies ſo, which is infallible. Yea, <hi>but reaſon will ſhew this to be the meaning of them.</hi> Yes, if we may uſe our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and rely upon it.

Your Preachers in their Sermons, do they not propoſe to men divine Revelations, and do they not ſometimes convince men in conſcience, by evident proof from Scripture, that the things they ſpeak are divine Revelations? And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, being thus convinced, ſhould oppoſe this divine Revelation, ſhould he not be an Heretique, according to your own grounds, for calling Gods own Truth into queſtion? And would you think your ſelf well dealt with, if I ſhould collect from hence, that you make every Preacher a ſafe, that is, an infallible Propounder of Faith? Be the means of Propoſal what it will, ſufficient or inſufficient, worthy of credit or not worthy; though it were, if it it were poſſible, the barking of a Dog, or the chirping of a Bird, or were it the diſcourſe of the Devil himſelf, yet if I be, I will not ſay convinced but perſwaded, though falſly, that it is a divine Revelation, and ſhall deny to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it I ſhall be a formal though not a material Heretique. For he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, though falſly, any thing to be a divine Revelation, and yet will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to be true, muſt of neceſſity believe God to be falſe, which, according to your own Doctrin, is the formality of an Heretique.</p>

Or perhaps this was not a caſe of moment. D. <hi>Potter</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed might ſay very well, not that the high Prieſt was infallible, (for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he was not) but that his determination was to be of neceſſity obeyed, though for the juſtice of it there was no neceſſity that it ſhould be believed. Beſides, it is one thing to ſay, that the living Judge in the Jewiſh Church had an infallible direction: another, that he was neceſſitated to follow this direction. This is the priviledge which you challenge. But it is that, not this, which the Doctor attributes to the Jews. As a man may truely ſay, the Wiſemen had an in fallible direction to Chriſt, without ſaying or thinking that they were conſtrained to follow it, and could not do otherwiſe.</p>

If Scripture be ſufficient to inform us what is the Faith, it muſt of neceſſity be alſo ſufficient to teach us what is Hereſie: ſeeing Hereſie is nothing but a manifeſt deviation from, and an oppoſition to, the Faith. That which is ſtreight will plainly teach us what is crooked; and one contrary cannot but manifeſt the other. If any one ſhould deny, that there is a God; that this God is omnipotent, omniſcient, good, juſt, true, mercifull, a rewarder of them that ſeek him, a puniſher of them that obſtinately offend him; That Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, and the Saviour of the World; that it is He, by obedience to whom men muſt look to be ſaved: If any man ſhould deny either his Birth, or Paſſion, or Reſurrection, or Aſcenſion, or Sitting at the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64345:62"/>right hand of God: his having all power given him in Heaven and Earth: That it is he whom God hath appointed to be Judg of the quick &amp; the dead: That all men ſhall riſe again at the laſt day: That they which believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ſhall be ſaved: That they which do not believe or repent ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: If a man ſhould hold that either the keeping of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law is neceſſary to Salvation: or that good works are not neceſſary to Salvation: In a word, if any man ſhould obſtinatly contradict the truth of any thing plainly delivered in Scripture, who does not ſee, that every one which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the Scripture, hath a ſufficient means to diſcover, and condemn, and avoid that Hereſie without any need of an infallible guide? If you ſay, that <hi>the obſcure places of Scripture contain matters of Faith:</hi> I anſwer, that it is a matter of faith to believe that the ſenſe of them, whatſoever it is, which was intended by God, is true; for he that doth not do ſo, calls Gods Truth into queſtion. But to believe this or that to be the true ſenſe of them, or, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the true ſenſe of them, and to avoid the falſe, is not neceſſary either to Faith or Salvation. For if God would have had his meaning in theſe places certainly known, how could it ſtand with his wiſdom, to be ſo wanting to his own will and end, as to ſpeak obſcurely? or how can it conſiſt with his Juſtice, to require of men to know certainly the meaning of thoſe words, which he himſelfe hath not revealed? Suppoſe there were an abſolute Monarch, that in his own abſence from one of his Kingdomes, had written Laws for the government of it, ſome very plainly, and ſome very ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guouſly, and obſcurely, and his Subjects ſhould keep thoſe that were plainly written with all exactneſs, and for thoſe that were obſcure, uſe their beſt diligence to find his meaning in them, and obey them according to the ſenſe of them which they conceived; ſhould this King either with juſtice or wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be offended with theſe Subjects, if, by reaſon of the obſcurity of them, they miſtook the ſenſe of them; and faild of performance, by reaſon of their errour?</p>

Another, that it would be yet more excellent, if all the Fathers of Families were ſo. And laſtly, another, that it were much more to be deſired that every Man and every Woman were ſo: juſt as much as the prevention of Controverſies, is better than the deciſion of them; and the prevention of Hereſies better then the condemnation of them; and upon this ground conclude, by your own very conſequence, That not only a general Councel, nor only the Pope, but all the Patriarchs, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, Biſhops, Paſtors, Fathers, nay all the men in the world are infallible; If you ſay now, as I am ſure you will, that this Concluſion is moſt groſs, and abſurd, againſt ſenſe and experience, then muſt alſo the ground be falſe, from which it evidently and undeniably followes, <hi>viz</hi> that that courſe of dealing with men ſeems alwayes more fit to Divine providence, which ſeems moſt fit to humane reaſon.</p>

129. And ſo likewiſe, That there ſhould men ſucceed the Apoſtles, which could ſhew themſelves to be their ſucceſſors, by doing of Miracles, by ſpeaking all kind of languages, by delivering men to Satan, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Hymenaeus,</hi> and the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian;</hi> it is manifeſt in human reaſon, it were incomparably more fit and uſeful for the deciſion of Controverſies, than that the ſucceſſour of the Apoſtles ſhould have none of theſe gifts, and for want of the ſigns of Apoſtleſhip, be juſtly queſtionable, whether he be his ſucceſſour or no: and will you now conclude, That the Popes have the gift of doing Miracles, as well as the Apoſtles had?</p>
                        <p n="130">130. It were in all reaſon very uſeful and requiſite, that the Pope ſhould, by the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, be freed from the vices and paſſions of men, leſt otherwiſe, the Authority given him for the good of the Church, he might imploy (as divers Popes you well know have done) to the diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, and oppreſſion, and miſchief of it. And will you conclude from hence, That Popes are not ſubject to the ſins and paſſions of other men? That there never have been ambitious, covetous, luſtful, tyrannous Popes?</p>
                        <p n="131">131. Who ſees not that for mens direction it were much more benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial for the Church, that Infallibility ſhould be ſetled in the Popes Perſon, than in a General Councel: That ſo the means of deciding Controverſies might be ſpeedy, eaſie, and perpetual, whereas that of general Councels is not ſo. And will you hence infer, that not the Church Repreſentative, but the Pope is indeed the infallible Judg of Controverſies? Certainly, if you ſhould, the <hi>Sorbon</hi> Doctors would not think this a good Concluſion.</p>
                        <p n="132">132. It had been very commodious (one would think) that ſeeing either Gods pleaſure was, the Scripture ſhould be tranſlated, or elſe in his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he knew it would be ſo, that he had appointed ſome men for this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and by his Spirit aſſiſted them in it, that ſo we might have Tranſlations as Authentical as the Original: yet you ſee God did not think fit to do ſo.</p>
                        <p n="133">133. It had been very commodious (one would think) that the Scripture ſhould have been, at leaſt for all things neceſſary, a Rule, plain and perfect: and yet you ſay, it is both imperfect and obſcure, even in things neceſſary.</p>
                        <p n="134">134. It had been moſt requiſite (one would think) that the Copies of the Bibles, ſhould have been preſerved free from variety of readings, which makes men very uncertain in many places, Which is the Word of God, and which is the Errour or preſumption of man: and yet we ſee God hath not thought fit ſo to provide for us.</p>
                        <p n="135">135. Who can conceive, but that an Apoſtolike Interpretation of all the difficult places of Scripture, would have been ſtrangely beneficial to the Church, eſpecially there being ſuch danger in miſtaking the ſenſe of them, as is by you pretended, and God in his Providence foreſeeing that the greateſt part of Chriſtians, would not accept of the Pope for the Judge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies? And yet we ſee God hath not ſo ordered the matter.</p>
                        <p n="136">136. Who doth not ſee, that, ſuppoſing the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had been appointed Head of the Church, and Judge of Controverſies, that it would have been infinitely beneficial to the Church, perhaps as much as all the reſt of the Bible, that in ſome Book of Scripture which was to be undoubtedly received, this one Propoſition had been ſet down in Terms, <hi>The Biſhops of</hi> Rome <hi>ſhall be alwayes Monarchs of the Church, and they either alone, or with their adherents, the Guides of Faith, and the Judges of Controverſies that ſhall ariſe amongſt Chriſtians?</hi> This, if you will deal ingenuouſly, you cannot but
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64345:63"/>acknowledge; for then all true Chriſtians would have ſubmitted to him, as willingly as to Chriſt himſelf, neither needed you and your Fellows have troubled your ſelf to invent ſo many Sophiſms for the proof of it. There would have been no more doubt of it among Chriſtians, than there is of the Nativity, Paſſion, Reſurrection, or Aſcenſion of Chriſt. You were beſt now rubb your forehead hard, and conclude upon us, that becauſe this would have been ſo uſeful to have been done, therefore it is done. Or if you be (as I know you are) too ingenuous to ſay ſo, then muſt you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the ground of your Argument, which is the very ground of all theſe abſurdities, is moſt abſurd; and that it is our duty to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thankful for thoſe ſufficient, nay abundant means, of Salvation, which God hath of his own goodneſs granted us: and not conclude he hath done that which he hath not done, becauſe, forſooth, in our vain judgments, it ſeems convenient he ſhould have done ſo.</p>
                        <p n="137">137. But you demand, <hi>What repugnance there is betwixt infallibility in the Church, and exiſtence of Scripture, that the production of the one muſt be the deſtruction of the other?</hi> Out of which words I can frame no other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for you than this; <hi>There is no Repugnance between the Scripture's exiſtence, and the Churche's infallibility, therefore the Church is infallible.</hi> Which conſequence will then be good, when you can ſhew that nothing can be untrue, but that only which is impoſſible; that whatſoever may be done, that alſo is done. Which, if it were true, would conclude both you and me to be infallible, as well as either your Church, or Pope: in as much as there is no more repugnance between the Scripture's exiſtence and our infallibility, than there is between theirs.</p>
                        <p n="138">138. <hi>But, if Proteſtants will have the Scripture alone for their Judge, let them firſt produce ſome Scripture, affirming, that by the entring thereof, infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility went out of the Church.</hi> This Argument put in form, runs thus. No Scripture affirms, that by the entring thereof, infallibility went out of the Church: Therefore there is an infallible Church, and therefore the Scripture alone is not Judge, that is, the Rule to judge by. But as no Scripture af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that by the entring of it, Infallibility went out of the Church, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do we, neither have we any need to do ſo. But we ſay, that it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church even together with the Scriptures, ſo long as Chriſt and his Apoſtles were living, and then departed: God in his providence having provided a plain and infallible Rule, to ſupply the defect of living and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Guides. Certainly, if your cauſe were good, ſo great a Wit as yours is, would deviſe better Arguments to maintain it. We can ſhew no Scripture affirming Infallibility to have gone out of the Church, therefore it is Infallible. Somewhat like his diſcourſe that ſaid, It could not be proved out of Scripture, that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was dead, therefore he is ſtill living. Me-thinks in all reaſon, you that challenge priviledges, and exemption from the condition of Men, which is to be ſubject to errour; You that by vertue of this priviledge uſurp authority over mens conſciences, ſhould produce your Letters Patents from the King of Heaven, and ſhew ſome expreſs warrant for this Authority you take upon you, otherwiſe you know the rule is, <hi>Ubi contrarium non manifeſtè probatur, praeſumitur pro libertate.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="139">139. <hi>But</hi> D. Potter <hi>may remember what himſelf teacheth, That the Church is ſtill endued with Infallibility in points Fundamental, and conſequently that Infallibility in the Church doth well agree with the Truth, the Sanctity, yea
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64345:64"/>with the ſufficiency of Scripture, for all matters neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> Still your diſcourſe is ſo far from hitting the White, that it roves quite beſides the Butt. You conclude, that the infallibility of the Church may well agree with the Truth, the Sanctity, the Sufficiency of Scripture. But what is this but to abuſe your Reader with the proof of that which no man denies? The Queſtion is not, Whether an infallible Church might agree with Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but whether there be an Infallible Church? <hi>Jam dic, Poſthume, de tribus Capellis.</hi> Beſides, you muſt know, there is a wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>being infallible in Fundamentals,</hi> and being an <hi>infallible Guide even in Fundamentals.</hi> D. <hi>Potter</hi> ſays, that the Church is the former: that is, There ſhall be ſome men in the world, while the world laſts, which err not in Fundamentals; for otherwiſe there ſhould be no Church: For to ſay, the Church, while it is the Church, may err in Fundamentals, implies contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and is all one as to ſay, The Church while it is the Church, may not be the Church. So that to ſay, that the Church is infallible in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, ſignifies no more but this, There ſhall be a Church in the world for ever. But we utterly deny the Church to be the latter; for to ſay ſo, were to oblige our ſelves to find ſome certain Society of men, of whom we might be certain, that they neither do, nor can, err in Fundamentals, nor in declaring what is Fundamental, what is not Fundamental: and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to make any Church an infallible Guide in Fundamentals, would be to make it infallible in all things, which ſhe propoſes and requires to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. This therefore we deny both to your and all other Churches of any one denomination, as the <hi>Greek,</hi> the <hi>Roman,</hi> the <hi>Abyſsine:</hi> that is indeed, we deny it ſimply to any Church. For no Church can poſſibly be fit to be a Guide, but only a Church of ſome certain denomination. For otherwiſe no man can poſſibly know which is the true Church, but by a pre-examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Doctrine controverted, and that were, not to be guided by the Church to the true doctrin, but by the true doctrin to the Church. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after therefore, when you hear Proteſtants ſay, The Church is Infallible in Fundamentals, you muſt not conceive them as if they meant, as you do, that ſome Society of Chriſtians, which may be known by adhering to ſome one Head, for example, the Pope, or the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> is infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in theſe things: but only thus, That true Religion ſhall never be ſo far driven out of the world, but that it ſhall have always, ſome where or other, ſome that believe and profeſs it, in all things neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
                        <p n="140">140. But, <hi>You would therefore gladly know out of what Text he imagines that the Church, by the coming of Scripture, was deprived of infallibility in ſome points, and not in others?</hi> And I alſo would gladly know, Why you do thus frame to your ſelf vain imaginations, and then father them upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? We yield unto you, That there ſhall be a Church which never er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in ſome points, becauſe (as we conceive) God hath promiſed ſo much; but not, there ſhall be ſuch a Church which doth or can err in no points, becauſe we find not, that God hath promiſed ſuch a Church; and therefore we may not promiſe ſuch a one to our ſelves. But, for the Churches being deprived by the Scripture of Infallibility, in ſome points, and not in others, that is a wild notion of your own, which we have nothing to do with.</p>
                        <p n="141">141. But he affirmeth, That <hi>The Jewiſh Church retained Infallibility in her ſelf; and therefore it is unjuſtly, and unworthily done of him to deprive the Church of Chriſt of it.</hi> That the Jews had ſometimes an infallible miraculous
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64345:64"/>direction from God in ſome caſes of moment, he doth affirm, and had good warrant: but that the Synagogue was abſolutely infallible, he no where affirms; and therefore it is unjuſtly and unworthily done of you to obtrude it upon him. And indeed how can the Infallibility of the Synagogue be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but only by ſetling it in the High-Prieſt, and the company adhering and ſubordinate unto him? And whether the High-Prieſt was Infallible, when he believed not Chriſt to be the Meſſias, but condemned and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated them that ſo profeſſed, and cauſed him to be crucified for ſaying ſo, I leave it to Chriſtians to judge. But then ſuppoſe God had been ſo pleaſed to do as he did not, to appoint the Synagogue an Infallible Guide: Could you by your rules of Logick conſtrain him to appoint ſuch an one to Chriſtians alſo; or ſay unto him, that in wiſdom he could not do otherwiſe? Vain man, that will be thus alwaystying God to your imaginations! It is well for us that he leaves us not without directions to him; but if he will do this ſometime by living Guides, ſometime by written Rules, What is that to you? May not he do what he will with his own?</p>
                        <p n="142">142. <hi>And whereas you ſay, for the further enforcing of this Argument, that there is greater reaſon to think the Church ſhould be infallible, than the Synagogue: becauſe to the Synaggoue all Laws and Ceremonies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>were more particularly, and minutely delivered, than in the new Teſtament is done; our Saviour leaving particulars to the determination of the Church.</hi> But I pray walk not thus in generality, but tell us, what <hi>particulars?</hi> If you mean particular Rites and Ceremonies, and orders for government, we grant it, and you know we do ſo. Our Saviour only hath left a general injunction by S. <hi>Paul, Let all things be done Decently, and in Order.</hi> But what Order is fitteſt, i. e. what Time, what Place, what Manner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is fitteſt, that he hath left to the diſcretion of the Governours of the Church. But, if you mean, that he hath only concerning matters of Faith, the ſubject in Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, preſcribed in general that we are to hear the Church, and left it to the Church to determine what particulars we are to believe, The Church being nothing elſe but an aggregation of Believers; this in effect is to ſay, He hath left it to all Believers to determine what Particulars they are to believe. Beſides, it is ſo apparently falſe, that I wonder you could content your ſelf, or think we ſhould be contented with a bare ſaying, without any ſhew or pretence of proof.</p>
                        <p n="143">143. As for D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s Objection againſt this Argument, <hi>That as well you might infer, that Chriſtians muſt have all one King, becauſe the Jews had ſo.</hi> For ought I can perceive, notwithſtanding any thing anſwered by you, it may ſtand ſtill in force; though the truth is, it is urged by him not againſt the Infallibility but the Monarchy of the Church. For whereas you ſay, The diſparity is very clear: He that ſhould urge this Argument for one Monarch over the whole world, would ſay that this is to deny the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and reply unto you, that there is diſparity as matters are now ordered, but that there ſhould not be ſo. For that there was no more reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Eccleſiaſtical Government of the Jews was a Pattern for the Eccleſiaſtical Government of Chriſtians, than the Civil of the Jews, for the Civil of the Chriſtians. He would tell you, that the Church of Chriſt, and all Chriſtian Commonwealths, and Kingdoms, are one and the ſame thing: and therefore he ſees no reaſon why the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue ſhould be a Type and Figure of the Church, and not of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:64345:65"/>He would tell you, that as the Church ſucceeded the Jewiſh Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, ſo Chriſtian Princes ſhould ſucceed to Jewiſh Magiſtrates: That is, the Temporal Governours of the Church ſhould be Chriſtians. He would tell you, that as the Church is compared to a Houſe, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, an Army, a Body, ſo all diſtinct Kingdoms might and ſhould be one Army, one Family, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that it is not ſo, is the thing he complains of. And therefore you ought not to think it enough to ſay, It is not ſo; but you ſhould ſhew, why it ſhould not be ſo; and why this Argument will not follow, The Jews had one King, therefore all Chriſtians ought to have: as well as this, The Jews had one High-Prieſt over them all, therefore all Chriſtians alſo ought to have. He might tell you moreover, that the Church may have one Maſter, one General, one Head, one King, and yet he not be the Pope, but Chriſt. He might tell you, that you beg the Queſtion, in ſaying without proof, that it is neceſſary to ſalvation, that all (whether Chriſtians or Churches) have recourſe to one Church, if you mean by one Church, one particular Church which is to govern and direct all others: and, that unleſs you mean ſo, you ſay nothing to the purpoſe. And beſides, he might tell you, and that very truly, that it may ſeem altogether as avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable for the Temporal good of Chriſtians to be under one Temporal Prince, or Commonwealth; as, for their ſalvation, to be ſubordinate to one Viſible Head. I ſay, as neceſſary, both for the prevention of the effuſion of the Blood of Chriſtians by Chriſtians, and for the defence of Chriſtendom, from the hoſtile invaſions of Turks, and Pagans. And from all this he might inferr, that though now, by the fault of men, there were in ſeveral Kingdoms, ſeveral Laws, Governments, and Powers; yet that it were much more expedient, that there were but one. Nay, not only expedient, but neceſſary; if once your ground be ſetled for a general Rule, that what kind of government the Jews had that the Chriſtians muſt have. And, if you limit the generality of this Propoſition, and frame the Argument thus: What kind of Eccleſiaſtical government the Jews had, that the Chriſtians muſt have: But, They were governed by one High-Prieſt, Therefore, Theſe muſt be ſo: He will ſay, that the firſt Propoſition of this Syllogiſm, is altogether as doubtful as the Concluſion; and therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fit nor ſufficient to prove it, until it ſelf be proved. And then beſides, that there is as great reaſon to believe this, That what kind of Civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Jews had, that the Chriſtians muſt have. And ſo D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection remains ſtill unanſwered: That there is as much reaſon to conclude a neceſſity of one King over all Chriſtian Kingdoms, from the Jews having one King; as one Biſhop over all Churches, from their being under one High-Prieſt.</p>
                        <p n="144">144. <hi>Ad.</hi> §. 24. Nether is this diſcourſe confirmed by <hi>Irenaeus</hi> at all: Whether by this diſcourſe you mean that immediatly foregoing, of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy between the Church and the Synagogue, to which this ſpeech of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> alledged here by you, is utterly and plainly impertinent; Or whether by this diſcourſe, you mean (as I think you do) not your Diſcourſe, but your Concluſion which you diſcourſe on, that is, that <hi>Your Church is the Infallible Judge in Controverſies.</hi> For neither hath <hi>Irenaeus</hi> one ſyllable to this purpoſe; neither can it be deduced out of what he ſays, with any colour of conſequence. For, firſt in ſaying, <hi>What if the Apoſtles had not left Scripture, ought we not to have followed the order of Tradition?</hi> And
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64345:65"/>in ſaying, <hi>That to this order many Nations yield aſſent, who believe in Chriſt, having Salvation written in their hearts by the Spirit of GOD, without Letters or Ink, and diligently keeping ancient Tradition:</hi> Doth he not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew, that the Tradition he ſpeaks of is nothing elſe, but the very ſame that is written: nothing but to believe in Chriſt? To which, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture alone, to them that believe it, be not a ſufficient guide, I leave it to you to judge. And are not his words juſt as if a man ſhould ſay, If God had not given us the light of the Sun, we muſt have made uſe of Candles and Torches: If we had no eyes, we muſt have felt out our way: If we had no legs, we muſt have uſed crutches. And doth not this in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect import, that while we have the Sun we need no Candles? While we have our eyes, we need not feel out our way? While we enjoy our legs, we need not crutches? And, by like reaſon, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in ſaying, <hi>If we had no Scripture, we muſt have followed Tradition; and they that have none, do well to do ſo;</hi> Doth he not plainly import, that to them that have Scripture and believe it, Tradition is unneceſſary? Which could not be, if the Scripture did not contain evidently the whole Tradition. Which, whether <hi>Irenaeus</hi> believed or no, theſe words of his may inform you, <hi>Non enim per alios,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>we have received the diſpoſition of our Salvation from no others, but from them by whom the Goſpel came unto us. Which Goſpel truly the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles firſt preached, and afterwards by the will of God delivered in writing to us, to be the Pillar and Foundation of our Faith.</hi> Upon which place, <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine's</hi> two Obſervations, and his acknowledgment enſuing upon them are very conſiderable; and, as I conceive, as home to my purpoſe as I would wiſh them. His firſt <hi>Notandum</hi> is, <hi>That, in the Chriſtian Doctrin, ſome things are ſimply neceſſary for the Salvation of all men; as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Articles of the Apoſtle's Creed; and beſides, the knowledge of the ten Commandments, and ſome of the Sacraments. Other things are not ſo neceſſary, but that a man may be ſaved without the explicit knowledge, and belief, and profeſsion of them.</hi> His ſecond Note is, <hi>That thoſe things, which were ſimply neceſſary, the Apoſtles were wont to preach to all men; But of other things not all to all; but, ſome things to all, to wit, thoſe things which were profitable for all, other things only, to Prelates and Prieſts.</hi> Theſe things premiſed, he acknowledgeth, <hi>That all thoſe things were written by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles which are neceſſary for all, and which they were wont openly to preach to all; But that other things were not all written: And therefore, when</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renaeus <hi>ſays, that the Apoſtles wrote what they preached in the World, it is true,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and not againſt Traditions, becauſe they preached not to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all things, but only thoſe things which were neceſſary or profitable for them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="145">145. So that at the moſt you can infer from hence but only a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive neceſſity of having an infallible Guide, and that grounded upon a falſe ſuppoſition, in caſe, we had no Scripture: but, an abſolute neceſſity hereof, and to them who have and believe the Scripture, which is your Aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, cannot with any colour from hence be concluded, but rather the contrary.</p>
                        <p n="146">146. Neither becauſe (as He ſays) it was <hi>then eaſie to receive the Truth from God's Church; then,</hi> in the Age next after the Apoſtles, Then, when all the Ancient and Apoſtolique Churches were at an agreement about the Fundamentals of Faith: Will it therefore follow, that now, 1600 years after, when the ancient Churches are divided almoſt into as many Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64345:66"/>as they are Churches, every one being the Church to it ſelf, and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical to all other, that it is as eaſie, but extreamly difficult or rather impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to find the Church firſt independently of the true Doctrin, and then to find the truth by the Church?</p>
                        <p n="147">147. As for the laſt clauſe of the ſentence, it will not any whit advantage, but rather prejudice your Aſſertion. Neither wil I ſeek to avoid the preſſure of it, by ſaying that he ſpeaks of <hi>ſmall Queſtions</hi> and therefore not of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions touching things neceſſary to Salvation, which can hardly be called ſmall Queſtions; But I will favour you ſo far, as to ſuppoſe, that ſaying this of ſmall Queſtions, it is probable he would have ſaid it much more of the Great: but I will anſwer that which is moſt certain and evident, and which I am confident you your ſelf, were you as impudent as I believe you modeſt, would not deny, That the Ancient Apoſtolique Churches are not now, as they were in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his time: then they were all at Unity about matters of Faith, which Unity was a good aſſurance that what they ſo agreed in, came from ſome one common Fountain, and that no other than of Apoſtolique Preaching. And this is the very ground of <hi>Tertullian's</hi> ſo often miſtaken <hi>Preſcription againſt Heretiques: Variâſſe debuerat Errer Eccleſiarum; quod autem apud multos unum eſt, non eſt erratum ſed tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum: If the Churches had erred, they could not but have varied; but that which is one among ſo many, came not by Error but Tradition.</hi> But now the caſe is altered, and the miſchief is, that theſe ancient Churches are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided among themſelves; and if we have recourſe to them, one of them will ſay, This is the way to heaven, another that. So that now, in place of receiving from them certain and clear truths, we muſt expect nothing but certain and clear contradictions.</p>
                        <p n="148">148. Neither will the <hi>Apoſtle's depoſiting with the Church all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to truth,</hi> be any proof that the Church ſhall certainly keep this <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum,</hi> entire and ſincere, without adding to it, or taking from it; for this whole <hi>depoſitum</hi> was committed to every particular Church, nay, to every particular man which the Apoſtles converted. And yet no man, I think, will ſay that there was any certainty, that it ſhould be kept whole and inviolate by every man, and every Church. It is apparent out of Scripture it was committed to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and by him conſigned to other faithful men: and yet S. <hi>Paul</hi> thought it not ſuperfluous, earneſtly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort him to the careful keeping of it: which exhortation you muſt grant had been vain and ſuperfluous, if the not keeping of it had been impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. And therefore though <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſays, <hi>The Apoſtles fully depoſited in the Church all truth,</hi> yet he ſays not, neither can we infer from what he ſays, That the Church ſhould always infallibly keep this <hi>depoſitum,</hi> entire, without the loſs of any truth, and ſincere without the mixture of any falſhood.</p>
                        <p n="149">149. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 25. But you proceed and tell us, <hi>That, beſide all this, the Doctrine of Proteſtants is deſtructive of it ſelf. For either they have certains and infallible means not to err in interpreting; or not. If not, Scripture to them cannot be a ſufficient ground for infallible faith: If they have, and ſo cannot err in interpreting Scripture, then they are able with infallibility to hear and determine all Controverſies of Faith; and ſo they may be, and are, Judges of Controverſies, although they uſe the Scripture as a Rule. And thus againſt their own doctrine, they conſtitute another Judge of Controverſies
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64345:66"/>beſide Scripture alone.</hi> And may not we with as much reaſon ſubſtitute Church and Papiſts inſtead of Scripture and Proteſtants, and ſay unto you, Beſides all this, the doctrin of Papiſts is deſtructive of it ſelf? For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have certain and infallible means not to err in the choice of the Church, and interpreting her Decrees, or they have not: If not, then the Church to them cannot be a ſufficient (but meerly a phantaſtical) ground for infallible faith, nor a meet Judge of Controverſies: (For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I be infallibly ſure that the Church is infallible, How can I be upon her Authority infallibly ſure, that any thing ſhe ſays is Infallible?) If they have certain infallible means, and ſo cannot err in the choice of their Church, and in interpreting her Decrees, then they are able with Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility to hear, examine, and determine all Controverſies of Faith, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they pretend to make the Church their Guide. And thus againſt their own Doctrine, they conſtitute another Judge of Controverſies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Church alone. Nay every one makes himſelf a chuſer of his own Religion, and of his own ſenſe of the Churches Decree, which very thing in Proteſtants they ſo highly condemn: and ſo, in judging others, condemn themſelves.</p>
                        <p n="150">150. Neither in ſaying thus have I only cried quittance with you: but that you may ſee how much you are in my debt, I will ſhew unto you that for your Sophiſm againſt our way, I have given you a Demonſtration againſt yours. Firſt, I ſay, your Argument againſt us is a tranſparent fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy. The firſt Part of it lies thus: Proteſtants have no means to interpret, without Errour, obſcure and ambiguous places of Scripture; therefore plain places of Scripture cannot be to them a ſufficient ground of Faith. But though we pretend not to certain means of not erring in interpreting all Scripture, particularly ſuch places as are obſcure and ambiguous, yet this me-thinks, ſhould be no impediment but that we may have certain means of not erring in and about the ſenſe of thoſe places, which are ſo plain and clear that they need no Interpreters; and in ſuch we ſay our Faith is contained. If you ask me, How I can be ſure that I know the true meaning of theſe places? I ask you again, Can you be ſure, that you underſtand what I, or any man elſe ſays? They that heard our Saviour and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles preach, could they have ſufficient aſſurance, that they underſtood at any time what they would have them do? If not, to what end did they hear them? If they could, Why may we not be as well aſſured that we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſufficiently what we conceive plain in their writings?</p>
                        <p n="151">151. Again, I pray tell us, whether you do certainly know the ſenſe of theſe Scriptures, with which you pretend you are led to the knowledge of your Church? If you do not, How know you that there is any Church Infallible, and that theſe are the notes of it, and that this is the Church that hath theſe notes? If you do, then give us leave to have the ſame means, and the ſame abilities to know other plain places, which you have to know theſe. For, if all Scripture be obſcure, how come you to know the ſenſe of theſe places? If ſome places of it be plain, Why ſhould we ſtay here?</p>
                        <p n="152">152. And now to come to the other part of your Dilemma; in ſaying, <hi>If they have certain means, and ſo cannot err,</hi> methinks you forget your ſelf very much, and ſeem to make no difference between having certain means to do a thing, and the actual doing of it. As if you ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64345:67"/>becauſe all men have certain means of Salvation, therefore all men certainly muſt be ſaved, and cannot do otherwiſe; as if, Whoſoever had a horſe muſt preſently get up and ride; Whoſoever had means to find out a way, could not neglect thoſe means and ſo miſtake it. God be thanked that we have ſufficient means to be certain enough of the truth of our Faith: But the priviledge of not being in poſſibility of erring that we challenge not, becauſe we have as little reaſon as you to do ſo: and you have none at all. If you ask, ſeeing we may poſſibly err, How can we be aſſured we do not? I ask you again, ſeeing your eye-ſight may deceive you, How can you be ſure you ſee the Sun, when you do ſee it? Perhaps you may be in a dream, and perhaps you, and all the men in the World have been ſo, when they thought they were awake, and then only awake, when they thought they dreamt. But this I am ſure of, as ſure as that God is good, that he will require no impoſſibilities of us: not an Infallible, nor a certainly-unerring belief, unleſs he hath given us certain means to avoid error; and, if we uſe thoſe which we have, will never require of us, that we uſe that which we have not.</p>
                        <p n="153">153. Now from this miſtaken ground, That it is all one to have means of avoiding error, and to be in no danger nor poſſibility of error; You infer upon us an abſurd Concluſion, <hi>That we make our ſelves able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Controverſies of Faith with Infallibility, and Judges of Controverſies.</hi> For the latter part of this Inference, we acknowledge and embrace it. We do make our ſelves Judges of Controverſies, that is, we do make uſe of our own underſtanding in the choice of our Religion. But this, if it be a crime, is common to us with you, (as I have proved above) and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is, not that we are chuſers, and you not chuſers, but that, we, as we conceive, chuſe wiſely, but you, being willfully blind, chuſe to follow thoſe that are ſo too; not remembring what our Saviour hath told you, <hi>When the blind lead the blind, both ſhall fall into the ditch.</hi> But then again I muſt tell you, You have done ill to confound together, <hi>Judges,</hi> and <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Judges;</hi> unleſs you will ſay, either that we have no Judges in our Courts of Civil Judicature, or that they are all Infallible.</p>
                        <p n="154">154. Thus have we caſt off your <hi>Dilemma,</hi> and broken both the horns of it. But now my retortion lies heavy upon you, and will not be turned off. For firſt you content not your ſelves with a moral certainty of the things you believe, nor with ſuch a degree of aſſurance of them, as is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to produce obedience to the condition of the new Covenant, which is all that we require. God's Spirit, if he pleaſe, may work more, a certainty of adherence beyond a certainty of evidence: But neither God doth, nor man may, require of us as our duty, to give a greater aſſent to the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than the premiſſes deſerve; to build an Infallible Faith upon Motives that are only highly credible, and not infallible, as it were a great and heavy building upon a foundation that hath not ſtrength proportionable. But though God require not of us ſuch unreaſonable things, You do; and tell men, They cannot be ſaved, unleſs they believe your Propoſals with an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Faith. To which end they muſt believe alſo your Propounder, your Church to be ſimply Infallible. Now how is it poſſible for them to give a rational aſſent to the Churches infallibility, unleſs they have ſome infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible means to know that ſhe is infallible? Neither can they infallibly know the infallibility of this means, but by ſome other, and ſo on for
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64345:67"/>ever: unleſs they can dig ſo deep as to come at length to the Rock, that is, <hi>to ſettle all upon ſomething evident of it ſelf,</hi> which is not ſo much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. But the laſt reſolution of all is into Motives, which indeed upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination will ſcarce appear probable, but are not ſo much as avouched to be any more than very credible. For example, if I ask you, Why you do believe Tranſubſtantiation? What can you anſwer, but becauſe it is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Prime Verity. I demand again, How can you aſſure your ſelf or me of that, being ready to embrace it if it may appear to be ſo? And what can you ſay, but that you know it to be ſo, becauſe the Church ſays ſo, which is infallible? If I ask, What mean you by your Church? You can tell me nothing but the company of Chriſtians which adhere to the <hi>Pope.</hi> I demand then further: Why ſhould I believe this company to be the infallible Propounder of Divine Revelation? And then you tell me, that there are many Motives to induce a man to this belief. But are theſe Motives laſtly infallible? No ſay you, but very credible. Well, let them paſs for ſuch, becauſe now we have not leiſure to examine them. Yet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks ſeeing the Motives to believe the Churches infallibility are only ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry credible, it ſhould alſo be but as credible that your Church is Infallible; and as credible, and no more, perhaps ſomewhat leſs, that her propoſals, particularly Tranſubſtantiation, are Divine Revelations. And me-thinks you ſhould require only a Moral, and modeſt aſſent to them, and not a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, as you call it, and infallible Faith. But then of theſe Motives to the Churches Infallibility, I hope you will give us leave to conſider, and judge whether they be indeed Motives, and ſufficient; or whether they be not Motives at all, or not ſufficient; or whether theſe Motives or inducements to your Church be not impeached, and oppoſed with Compulſives and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements from it; or laſtly, Whether theſe Motives which You uſe, be not indeed only Motives to Chriſtianity, and not to <hi>Popery:</hi> give me leave for diſtinction-ſake to call your Religion ſo. If we may not judge of theſe things, How can my judgment be moved with that which comes not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its cognizance? If I may, then at leaſt I am to be a Judg of all theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies.

Am I a ſufficient Judge of theſe Controverſies, or no? If of theſe, why ſhall I ſtay here, why not of others? Why not of all?

And one of theſe fifteen contains in it the examination of all Controverſies; and not only ſo, but of all uncontroverted Doctrines. For how ſhall I, or can I, <hi>know the Church of</hi> Rome's <hi>conformity with the Ancient Church,</hi> unleſs I know firſt what the Ancient Church did hold, and then what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth hold; and laſtly, whether they be conformable, or, if in my judgment they ſeem not conformable, I am then to think the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> not to be the Church, for want of the Note which ſhe pretends, is proper, and perpetual to it.

155. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 26. I anſwer; This Aſſertion, that <hi>Scripture alone is Judge of all Controverſies in Faith;</hi> if it be taken properly, is neither a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental nor Unfundamental point of Faith, nor no point of Faith at all, but a plain falſhood. It is not a <hi>Judge of Controverſies, but a Rule to judge them by;</hi> and that not an abſolutely perfect Rule, but as perfect as a written Rule can be; which muſt always need ſomething elſe, which is either evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently true, or evidently credible, to give atteſtation to it, and that in this caſe is Univerſal Tradition. So that Univerſal Tradition is the Rule to judge all Controverſies by. But then becauſe nothing, beſides Scripture, comes to us with as full a ſtream of Tradition as Scripture, Scripture alone, and no unwritten Doctrin, nor no Infallibility of any Church, having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation from Tradition truly Univerſal; for this reaſon we conceive, as the Apoſtles perſons while they were living were the only Judges of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, ſo their Writings, now they are dead, are the only Rule for us to judge them by; There being nothing unwritten, which can go in upon half ſo fair cards, for the Title of Apoſtolike Tradition, as theſe things, which by the confeſſion of both Sides are not ſo: I mean <hi>the Doctrine of the Millenaries,</hi> and <hi>of the neceſsity of the Euchariſt for Infants.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="156">156. Yet when we ſay, The Scripture is the only Rule to judge all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies by; me-thinks you ſhould eaſily conceive, that we would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, of all thoſe that are poſſible to be judged by Scripture, and of thoſe that ariſe among ſuch as believe the Scripture. For, if I had a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with an Atheiſt whether there were a God or no, I would not ſay, that the Scripture were a Rule to judge this by; ſeeing that, doubting whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be a God or no, he muſt needs doubt whether the Scripture be the Word of God: or, if he does not, he grants the Queſtion, and is not the man we ſpeak of. So likewiſe, if I had a Controverſie about the Truth of Chriſt with a Jew, it would be vainly done of me, ſhould I preſs him with the Authority of the New Teſtament which he believes not, until out of ſome principles common to us both, I had perſwaded him that it is the Word of God. The New Teſtament therefore, while he remains a Jew, would not be a fit Rule to decide this Controverſie; in as much as that which is doubted of it ſelf, is not fit to determine other doubts. So likewiſe, if there were any that believed Chriſtian Religion, and yet believed not the Bible to be the Word of God, though they believed the matter of it to be true, (which is no impoſſible ſuppoſition; for I may believe a Book S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s to contain nothing but the Truth of God, and yet not to have been inſpired by God himſelf,) againſt ſuch men therefore there were no diſputing out of the Bible; becauſe nothing in queſtion can be a proof to it ſelf. When therefore we ſay, Scripture is a ſufficient means to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all Controverſies, we ſay not this, either to Atheiſts, Jews, Turks, or ſuch Chriſtians (if there be any ſuch) as believe not Scripture to be the Word of God. But among ſuch men only, as are already agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, that <hi>the Scripture is the Word of God,</hi> we ſay, All Controverſies that ariſe about Faith, are either not at all decidable, and conſequently not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be believed one way or other; or they may be determined by Scripture. In a word, That all things neceſſary to be believed are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently contained in Scripture, and what is not there evidently contained, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be neceſſary to be believed. And our reaſon hereof is convincing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing can challenge our belief, but what hath deſcended to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64345:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>us from Chriſt by Original and Univerſal Tradition: Now nothing but Scripture hath thus deſcended to us, Therefore nothing but Scripture can challenge our belief. Now then to come up cloſer to you, and to anſwer to your Queſtion, not as you put it, but as you ſhould have put it: I ſay, That this Poſition, <hi>Scripture alone is the Rule whereby they which believe it to be God's Word, are to judge all Controverſies in Faith,</hi> is no fundamental point, Though not for your Reaſons: For, your firſt and ſtrongeſt reaſon, you ſee, is plainly voided and cut off by my ſtating of the Queſtion as I have done, and ſuppoſing in it, that the parties at variance, are agreed about this, That the Scripture is the Word of God; and conſequently that this is none of their Controverſies. To your ſecond, That <hi>Controverſies cannot be ended without ſome living Authority,</hi> We have ſaid already, that Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Controverſies may be and are decided. And, if they be not ended, this is not through defect of the Rule, but through the default of Men. And, for theſe that cannot thus be ended, it is not neceſſary they ſhould be ended. For, if God did require the ending of them, he would have provided ſome certain means for the ending of them. And, to your Third, I ſay, that Your pretence of <hi>uſing theſe means,</hi> is but hypocritical; for you uſe them with prejudice, and with a ſetled reſolution not to believe any thing which theſe means happily may ſuggeſt into you, if it any way croſs your pre-conceived perſwaſion of your Churche's Infallibility. You give not your ſelves liberty of judgment in the uſe of them, nor ſuffer your ſelves to be led by them to the Truth, to which they would lead you, would you but be as willing to believe this Conſequence, Our Church doth oppoſe Scripture, therefore it doth err, therefore it is not infallible; as you are reſolute to believe this, The Church is infallible, therefore it doth not err, and therefore it doth not oppoſe Scripture, though it ſeem to do ſo never ſo plainly.</p>
                        <p n="157">157. <hi>You pray,</hi> but it is not that God would bring you to the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but that he would confirm you in your own. <hi>Youconferr places,</hi> but it is that you may confirm, or colour over with plauſible diſguiſes your erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous doctrin not that you may judge of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and forſake them, if there be reaſon for it. <hi>You conſult the Originals,</hi> but you regard them not when they make againſt your Doctrin or Tranſlation.</p>
                        <p n="158">158. You add not only the Authority, but the Infallibility, not of God's Church, but of the <hi>Roman,</hi> a very corrupt and degenerous part of it: whereof.

And which being a company made up of particular men, can afford you no help, but the induſtry, learning, and wit of private men: and, that theſe helps may not help you out of your errour, tell you, that you muſt make uſe of none of all theſe to diſcover any error in the Church, but only to maintain her impoſſibility of erring. And laſtly, D. <hi>Potter</hi> aſſures himſelf that your Doctrine and Practices are damnable enough in themſelves; On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he hopes (and <hi>ſpes eſt rei inceriae nomen</hi>) he hopes, I ſay, that the Truths which you retain, eſpecially the neceſſity of repentance and faith in Chriſt, will be as an Antidote to you againſt the errors which you maintain; and that your ſuperſtruction may burn, yet they amongſt you, <hi>qui ſequuntur Abſalonem in ſimplicitate cordis,</hi> may be ſaved, <hi>yet ſo as by fire.</hi> Yet his thinking ſo, is no reaſon for you or me to think ſo, unleſs you ſuppoſe him infallible; and, if you do, Why do you write againſt him?</p>

159. Notwithſtanding, though not for theſe reaſons, yet for others, I conceive this Doctrine not Fundamental: Becauſe, if a man ſhould believe Chriſtian Religion wholely, and entirely, and live according to it, ſuch a man, though he ſhould not know or not believe the Scripture to be a Rule of Faith, no nor to be the Word of God, my opinion is, he may be ſaved; and my reaſon is, becauſe he performs the entire condition of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which is, that we believe the matter of the Goſpel, and not that it is contained in theſe or theſe Books. So that the Books of Scripture are not ſo much the Objects of our faith, as the inſtruments of conveying it to our underſtanding; and not ſo much of the being of the Chriſtian Doctrin, as requiſite to the wel-being of it, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tells us (as <hi>M. K.</hi> acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) of ſome barbarous Nations, that <hi>believed the Doctrine of Chriſt, and yet believed not the Scripture to be the Word of God; for they never heard of it, and Faith comes by hearing:</hi> But theſe barbarous people might be ſaved: Therefore men might be ſaved without believing the Scripture to be the Word of God; much more without believing it to be a Rule, and a perfect Rule of Faith. Neither doubt I, but if the Books of Scripture had been propoſed to them by the other parts of the Church, where they had been before received, and had been doubted of, or even rejected by thoſe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Nations, but ſtill by the bare belief and practice of Chriſtianity, they might be ſaved; God requiting of us under pain of damnation, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to believe the verities therein contained, and not the divine Authority of the Books wherein they are contained. Not but that it were now very ſtrange and unreaſonable, if a man ſhould believe the matter of theſe Books, and not the Authority of the Books: and therefore, if a man ſhould profeſs the not-believing of theſe, I ſhould have reaſon to fear he did not believe that. But there is not always an equal neceſſity for the belief of thoſe things, for the belief whereof there is an equal reaſon. We have, I believe, as great reaſon to believe there was ſuch a man as <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth King of <hi>England,</hi> as that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſuffered under <hi>Pontius Pilate:</hi> yet this is neceſſary to be believed, and that is not ſo. So that, if any man ſhould doubt of or d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore as an Executor, that ſhould perform the whole will of the dead, ſhould fully ſatisfie the Law, though he did not believe that Parchment to be his written Will, which indeed is ſo: So I believe, that he, who believes all the particular Doctrines which integrate Chriſtianity, and lives according to them, ſhould be ſaved, though he neither believed nor knew that the Goſpels were written by the Evangeliſts, or the Epiſtles by the Apoſtles.</p>

This diſourſe, whether it be rational, and concluding or no, I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to better judgment; but ſure I am, that the Corollary, which you draw from this Poſition, <hi>that this Point is not Fundamental,</hi> is very inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; that is, <hi>that we are uncertain of the truth of it,</hi> becauſe we ſay, The whole Church, much more particular Churches and private men may err in points not Fundamental.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64345:69"/>infallible even in Fundamentals, that even the Fundamentals of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, remain to you uncertain? A Judge may poſſibly err in judgment, can he therefore never have aſſurance that he hath judged right?

Laſtly, it is evident, and even to Impudence it ſelf undeniable, that upon this ground, <hi>of believing all things taught by the preſent Church as taught by Chriſt,</hi> Error was held; for example, <hi>the neceſsity of the Euchariſt for Infants,</hi> and that in S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time, and that by S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf: and therefore without controverſie this is no certain ground for truth, which may ſupport falſhood as well as truth.</p>
                        <p n="164">164. To the Argument wherewith you conclude, I anſwer, That though the Viſible Church ſhall always without fail propoſe ſo much of God's Revelation, as is ſufficient to bring men to Heaven, for otherwiſe it will not be the viſible Church; yet it may ſometimes add to this revelation things ſuperfluous, nay, hurtful, nay in themſelves damnable, though not unpardonable; and ſometimes take from it things very expedient and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; and therefore it is poſſible, without ſin, to reſiſt in ſome things the Viſible Church of Chriſt. But you preſs us farther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and demand, <hi>What
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64345:70"/>viſible Church was extant, when</hi> Luther <hi>began, whether it were the</hi> Roman <hi>or Proteſtant Church?</hi> As if, it muſt of neceſſity either be Proteſtant or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> of neceſſity, if it were not Proteſtant. Yet this is the moſt uſual fallacy of all your Diſputers, by ſome ſpecious Arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade weak men, that the Church of Proteſtants cannot be the true Church; and thence to inferr, that without doubt it muſt be the <hi>Roman.</hi> But why may not the <hi>Roman</hi> be content to be a part of it, and the Grecian ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? And if one muſt be the whole, why not the Greek Church, as well as the <hi>Roman?</hi> there being not one Note of your Church which agrees not to her as well as to your own; unleſs it be; that ſhe is poor, and oppreſſed by the Turk, and you are in glory and ſplendor.</p>

For, if you object their bitter and continued diſcords in matters of Faith, without any means of agreement: they inſtantly tell you (as <hi>Charity Miſtaken</hi> plainly ſhews) that they differ only in Points not Fundamental. If you convince them, even by their own Confeſſions, that the Ancient. Fathers taught divers Points held by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church againſt Proteſtants: they reply, that thoſe Fathers may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs be ſaved, becauſe thoſe errors were not Fundamental. If you will them to remember, that Chriſt muſt alwayes have a Viſible Church on earth, with adminiſtration of Sacraments, and ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Paſtors, and that when <hi>Luther</hi> appeared there was no Church diſtinct from the <hi>Roman,</hi> whoſe <hi>Communion</hi> and <hi>Doctrine, Luther</hi> then forſook, and for that cauſe muſt be guilty of <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Hereſie:</hi> they have an Anſwer (ſuch as it is) that the Catholique Church cannot periſh, yet may err in Points not Fundamental, and therefore <hi>Luther</hi> and other Proteſtants were obliged to forſake her for ſuch er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, under pain of <hi>Damnation:</hi> as if (ſorſooth) it were <hi>Damnable,</hi> to hold an error not-<hi>Fundamental,</hi> nor <hi>Damnable.</hi> If you wonder how they can teach, that both Catholiques and Proteſtants may be ſaved in their ſeveral Profeſſions: they ſalve this contradiction, by ſaying, that we both agree in all Fundamental Points of Faith, which is enough for ſalvation, And yet, which is prodigiouſly ſtrange, they could never be induced to give a Catalogue what Points in particular be Fundamental, but only by ſome general deſcription, or by referring us to the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> without determining, what Points therein be Fundamental, or not Fundamental for the matter: and in what ſenſe they be, or be not, ſuch: And yet concerning the meaning of divers Points contained, or reduced to the <hi>Creed,</hi> they differ both from us, and among themſelves. And indeed, it being impoſſible for them to exhibit any ſuch Catalogue, the ſaid diſtinction of Points, although it were pertinent and true, cannot ſerve them to any purpoſe, but ſtill they muſt remain uncertain, whether or not they diſagree from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from the ancient Fathers, and from the Catholique Church, in Points Fundamental: which is to ſay, they have no certainty whether they enjoy the ſubſtance of Chriſtian Faith, without which they cannot hope to be ſaved. But of this more hereafter.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. And to the end, that what ſhall be ſaid concerning this diſtinction may be better underſtood, we are to obſerve, that there be two precepts which concern the vertue of Faith, or our obligation to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> divine Truths. The one is by Divines called <hi>Affirmative,</hi> whereby we are obliged to have a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive explicit belief of ſome chief Articles of Chriſtian Faith. The other is temed <hi>Negative,</hi> which ſtrictly binds us not to disbelieve, that is, not to believe the contrary of any one Point ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to our underſtandings, as revealed or ſpoken by Almighty God. The ſaid <hi>Affirmative Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> (according to the nature of ſuch commands) injoyns ſome Act to be performed but not at all <hi>times,</hi> nor doth it equally bind all ſorts of <hi>perſons,</hi> in reſpect of all <hi>Objects</hi> to be believed. For <hi>Objects;</hi> we
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64345:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>grant that ſome are more neceſſary to be explicitely, and ſeverally believed than other: either becauſe they are in themſelves more great, and weighty; or elſe in regard they inſtruct us in ſome neceſſary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian duty towards God, our Selves, or our Neighbour. For <hi>Perſons;</hi> no doubt but ſome are obliged to know diſtinctly more than others, by reaſon of their office, vocation, capacity, or the like. For <hi>Times;</hi> we are not obliged to be ſtill in act of exerciſing acts of Faith, but according as ſeveral occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions permit, or require. The ſecond kind of Precept called <hi>Negative,</hi> doth (according to the nature of all ſuch commands) oblige <hi>univerſally,</hi> all <hi>Perſons,</hi> in reſpect of all <hi>Objects;</hi> and at all <hi>Times; ſemper &amp; pro ſemper,</hi> as Divines ſpeak, This general Doctrin will be more clear by Examples. I am not obliged to be always helping my Neighbour, becauſe the <hi>Affirmative</hi> Precept of <hi>Charity</hi> bindeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſome particular caſes: But I am always bound by a <hi>Negative</hi> Precept, never to do him any hurt, or wrong. I am not always bound to utter what I know to be true: yet I am obliged, never to ſpeak any one leaſt untruth, againſt my knowledge. And (to come to our preſent purpoſe) there is no <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative</hi> Precept, commanding us to be at <hi>all times</hi> actually believing any <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>all</hi> Articles of Faith. But we are obliged, <hi>never</hi> to exerciſe any act againſt any one truth, known to be revealed. All ſorts of <hi>Perſons</hi> are not bound explicitely and diſtinctly to know all things teſtified by God either in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, or otherwiſe: but every one is obliged, not to believe the contrary of any one Point, known to be teſtified by God. For that were in fact to affirm, that God could be deceived, or would deceive, which were to overthrow the whole certainty of our Faith, wherein the thing moſt principal, is not the Point which we believe, which Divines call the <hi>Material Object,</hi> but the chiefeſt is the <hi>Motive</hi> for which we believe, to wit, Almighty God's infallible Revelation, or Authority, which they term the <hi>Formal Object</hi> of our Faith. In two ſenſes therefore, and with a double relation, Points of Faith may be called Fundamental, and neceſſary to Salvation: The one is taken with reference to the <hi>Affirmative</hi> Precept, when the Points are of ſuch quality that there is obligation to know and believe them explicitely and ſeverally. In this ſenſe we grant that there is difference betwixt Points of Faith, which D. <hi>Potter</hi>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Pag.</hi> 209.</note> to no purpoſe laboureth to prove againſt his Adverſary, who in expreſs words doth grant and explicate<note n="(b)" place="margin">Charity Miſtaken, <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 75.</note> it. But the <hi>Doctor</hi> thought good to diſſemble the matter, and not to ſay one pertinent word in defence of his diſtinction, as it was impugned by <hi>Charity Miſtaken,</hi> and as it is wont to be applyed by Proteſtants. The other ſenſe, according to which Points of Faith may be called <hi>Fundamental,</hi> and neceſſary to Salvation with reference to the <hi>Negative</hi> Precept of Faith, is ſuch, that we cannot without grievous ſin, and forfeiture of Salvation disbelieve any one Point, ſufficiently propounded, as revealed by Almighty God. And in this ſenſe we avouch, that there is no diſtinction in Points of Faith, as if to reject ſome muſt be damnable, and to reject others, equally propoſed as God's Word, might ſtand with Salvation. Yea, the obligation of the <hi>Negative</hi> Precept is far more ſtrict, than is that of the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> which God freely impoſed, and may freely releaſe. But it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that he can diſpenſe, or give leave to disbelieve, or deny what he affirmeth; and in this ſenſe ſin and damnation are more inſeparable from <hi>Error</hi> in Points <hi>not Fundamental,</hi> than from <hi>Ignorance</hi> in Articles <hi>Fundamental.</hi> All this I ſhew by an example, which I wiſh to be particularly noted for the preſent, and for divers other occaſions hereafter. The <hi>Creed</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> contains divers Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Points of Faith, as the Deity, Trinity of Perſons, Incarnation, Paſſion, and Reſurrection of our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It contains alſo ſome Points, for their matter, and nature in themſelves not Fundamental; as under what Judge our Saviour ſuffered, that he was buried, the circumſtance of the time of his Reſurrection the third day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But yet nevertheleſs, whoſoever once knows that theſe Points are contained in the Apoſtles <hi>Creed,</hi> the denial of them is damnable, and is in that ſenſe a <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental</hi> error: and this is the preciſe Point of the preſent queſtion.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. And all that hitherto hath been ſaid, is ſo manifeſtly true, that no Proteſtant or Chriſtian, if he do but underſtand the terms, and ſtate of the queſtion, can poſſibly deny it: In ſo much as I am amazed, that men who otherwiſe are indued with excellent wits, ſhould ſo enſlave themſelves to their Predeceſſors in Proteſtantiſm, as ſtill to harp on this diſtinction, and never regard how impertinently, and untruly it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>plyed by them at firſt, to make all Proteſtants ſeem to be of one Faith, becauſe forſooth they agree in Fundamental Points. For the difference among Proteſtants, conſiſts not in that ſome believe ſome Points, of which others are ignorant, or not bound expreſsly to know (as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction ought to be applyed;) but that ſome of them disbelieve, and directly, wittingly, and willingly oppoſe what others do believe to be teſtified by the Word of God, wherein there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Points Fundamental, and not Fundamental; Becauſe, till Points Fundamental be ſufficiently propoſed as revealed by God, it is not againſt Faith to reject them, or rather without ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient propoſition it is not poſſible prudently to believe them; and the like is of Points not-Fundamental, which as ſoon as they come to be ſufficiently propounded as divine Truths, they can no more be denied, than Points Fundamental propounded after the ſame manner. Neither will it avail them to their other end, that, for preſervation of the Church in being, it is ſufficient that ſhe do not err in Points Fundamental. For, if in the mean time ſhe maintain any one Error againſt Gods revelation, be the thing in it ſelf never ſo ſmall, her Error is damnable and deſtructive of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But D. <hi>Potter</hi> forgetting to what purpoſe Proteſtants make uſe of their diſtinction, doth finally overthrow it, and yields to as much as we can deſire. For ſpeaking of that <hi>meaſure</hi>
                        <note n="(c)" place="margin">

                        <hi>and quantity of Faith without which none can be ſaved,</hi> he ſaith: <hi>It is enough to believe ſome things by a vertual Faith, or by a general, and, as it were, a negative Faith, whereby they are not denied or contradicted.</hi> Now our que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is in caſe that divine Truths, although not Fundamental, be denied and contradicted; and therefore, even according to him, all ſuch denial excludes Salvation. After, he ſpeaks more plainly. <hi>It is true</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whatſoever</hi>

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64345:71"/>Chriſtian is bound, with humility, and reverence to believe, whenſoever the knowledge thereof is offered to him.</hi> And further: <hi>Where</hi>

                        <hi>the revealed Will or Word of God is ſufficiently propounded; there he that oppoſeth, is convinced of Error, and he, who is thus convinced, is an Heretick, and Hereſie is a work of the fleſh which excludeth from heaven,</hi> (<hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20, 21.) <hi>And hence it followeth, that it is FUNDA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTAL to a Chriſtian's FAITH, and neceſſary for his Salvation, that he believe all revealed Truths of God, whereof he may be convinced that they are from God.</hi> Can any thing be ſpoken more clearly or directly for us, that it is a <hi>Fundamental</hi> Error to deny any one Point, though never ſo ſmall, if once it be ſufficiently propounded as a divine Truth, and that there is in this ſenſe, no diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Points Fundamental, and not Fundamental? And if any ſhould chance to imagine, that it is againſt the foundation of Faith, not to believe Points <hi>Fundamental,</hi> although they be not ſufficiently propounded, D. <hi>Potter</hi> doth not admit of this<note n="(f)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Pag.</hi> 246.</note> difference betwixt Points Fundamental, and not-Fundamental. For he teacheth, that <hi>ſufficient propoſition of revealed Truth is required before a man can be convinced,</hi> and for want of ſufficient conviction he excuſeth the Diſciples from Hereſie, although they believed not our Saviour's Reſurrection,<note n="(g)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Pag</hi> 246.</note> which is a very Fundamental Point of Faith. Thus then I argue out of D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s own confeſſion: No error is damnable unleſs the contrary Truth be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficiently propounded as revealed by God: Every Error is damnable, if the contrary Truth be ſufficiently propounded as revealed by God: Therefore all Errors are alike for the general effect of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, if the difference ariſe not, from the manner of being propounded. And what now is become of their diſtinction?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. I will therefore conclude with this Argument. According to all Philoſophy and Divinity, <hi>the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and diſtinction of every thing followeth the Nature and Eſſence thereof; and therefore, if the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> of Faith, be not taken from the matter which a man believes, but from the motive for which he believes, (which is God's Word or Revelation) we muſt likewiſe affum that the <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Diverſity</hi> of Faith, muſt be meaſured by God's Revelation (which is alike for all objects) and not by the ſmalneſs, or greatneſs of the matter which we believe. Now, that the nature of Faith is not taken from the greatneſs, or ſmalneſs of the things believed, is manifeſt; becauſe otherwiſe one who believes only Fundam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ntal Points, and another, who together with them, doth alſo believe Points not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, ſhould have Faith of different natures, yea there ſhould be as many differences of Faith, as there are different Points which men believe, according to different capacities or inſtructions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which conſequences are abſurd, and therefore we muſt ſay, that <hi>Unity in Faith</hi> doth not depend upon Points Fundamental, or not Fundamental, but upon Gods Revelation equally or unequally propoſed: and Proteſtants pretending an <hi>Unity</hi> only by reaſon of their agreement in Fundamental Points, do indeed induce as great a multiplicity of Faith as there is multitude of different objects which are believed by them, and ſince they diſagree in things <hi>Equally revealed</hi> by Almighty God, it is evident that they forſake the very <hi>Formal motive</hi> of Faith, which is God's revelation, and conſequently loſe all <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Unity</hi> therein.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The firſt part of the Title of this Chapter <hi>(That the diſtinction of Points Fundamental, and not Fundamental in the ſenſe of Proteſtants, is both impertinent and untrue)</hi> being demonſtrated; let us now come to the ſecond: <hi>That the Church is inſallible in all her definitions, whether they concern Points Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, or not Fundamental.</hi> And this I prove by theſe reaſons.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. It hath been ſhewed in the precedent Chapter, that the Church is Judge of Controverſies; which ſhe could not be, if ſhe could err in any one Point; as D. <hi>Potter</hi> would not deny, if he were once perſwaded that ſhe is Judge. Becauſe, if ſhe could err in ſome Points, we could not relie upon her <hi>Authority</hi> and Judgement in any one thing.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. This ſame is proved by the reaſon we alledged before, that ſeeing the Church was infallible in all her definitions ore Scripture was written (unleſs we will take away all certainty of Faith for that time) we cannot with any ſhew of reaſon affirm, that ſhe hath been deprived thereof by the adjoyned comfort, and help of Sacred Writ.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Moreover, to ſay that the Catholique Church may propoſe any falſe Doctrin, maketh her liable to <hi>damnable</hi> ſin and error; and yet D. <hi>Potter</hi> teacheth that the Church cannot err <hi>damnably.</hi> For if in that kind of Oath, which Divines call <hi>Aſſertorium,</hi> wherein God is called to witneſs, every falſhood is a deadly ſin in any private perſon whatſoever, although the thing be of it ſelf neither ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, nor prejudicial to any; becauſe the quantity or greatneſs of that ſin is not meaſured ſo much by the thing which is affirmed, as by the manner, and authority whereby it is avouched, and by the injury that is offered to Almighty God in applying his teſtimony to a ſalſhood: in which reſpect it is the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous conſent of all Divines, that in ſuch k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beſides, according to the Doctrin of all Divines, it is not only injurious to God's Eternal Verity, to disbelieve things by him revealed, but alſo to propoſe as revealed Truths, things not revealed: as in Commonwealths it is a hainous offence to coyn either by counterfeiting, the metal or the ſtamp, or to apply the King's Seal to a writing counterfeit, although the contents were ſuppoſed to be true. And whereas to ſhew the deteſtable ſin of ſuch pernitious fictions, the Church doth moſt exemplarly puniſh all broachers-of feigned revelations, viſions, miracles, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as in particular appeareth in the Councel of<note n="(h)" place="margin">Sub.

                     <p n="10">10. Perhaps ſome will here reply, that although the Church may err, yet it is nor imputed to her for ſin, by reaſon ſhe doth not err upon malice or wittingly, but by ignorance, or miſtake.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. But it is eaſily demonſtrated that this excuſe cannot ſerve. For, if the Church be aſſiſted only for Points Fundamental, ſhe cannot but know, that ſhe may err in Points not Fundamental, at leaſt ſhe cannot be certain that ſhe cannot err, and therefore cannot be excuſed from headlong and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious temerity, in propoſing Points not Fundamental, to be believed by Chriſtians, as matters of Faith, wherein ſhe can have no certainty, yea which always imply a falſhood. For although the thing might chance to be true, and perhaps alſo revealed; yet, for the <hi>matter,</hi> ſhe for her part, doth always expoſe her ſelf to danger of falſhood and error; and in fact doth always err in the <hi>manner</hi> in which ſhe doth propound any matter not Fundamental; becauſe ſhe propoſeth it as a Point of Faith <hi>certainly</hi> true, which yet is always uncertain, if ſhe in ſuch things may be deceived.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Beſides, if the Church may err in Points not Fundamental, ſhe may err in propoſing ſome Scripture for Canonical, which is not ſuch: or elſe err in nor keeping and conſerving from corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſuch Scriptures as are already believed to be Canonical. For I will ſuppoſe, that in ſuch Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal Scripture as ſhe delivers, there is no Fundamental Error againſt Faith, or that there is no falſhood at all, but only want of Divine teſtification: in which caſe D. <hi>Potter</hi> muſt either grant that it is a Fundamental Error to apply Divine revelation to any Point not revealed, or elſe muſt yield, that the Church may err in her <hi>Propoſition,</hi> or <hi>Cuſtody</hi> of the Canon of Scripture: and ſo we cannot be ſure whether ſhe hath not been deceived already, in Books recommended by her, and accepted by Chriſtians. And thus we ſhall have no certainty of Scripture, if the Church want certainty in all her definitions. And it is worthy to be obſerved, that ſome Books of Scripture which were not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes known to be Canonical, have been afterward received for ſuch; but never any on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Book or ſyllable defined by the Church to be Canonical, was afterward queſtioned, or rejected for Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal. A ſign, that God's Church is infallibly aſſiſted by the holy Ghoſt, never to propoſe as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth, any thing not revealed by God: and that, <hi>Omiſſion</hi> to define Points not ſufficiently diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is laudable, but <hi>Commiſſion</hi> in propounding things not revealed, inexcuſable; into which precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation our Saviour Chriſt never hath, nor never will, permit his Church to fall.</p>

But all truth is not ſimply all, but all of ſome kind. To be lead into all truths, is to know and believe them. And who is ſo ſimple, as to be ignorant, that there are many millions of Truths (in Nature, Hiſtory, Divinity) whereof the Church is ſimply ignorant? How many Truths lie unrevealed in the infinite Treaſury of God's wiſdom, wherewith the Church is not acquainted,</hi> &amp;c? <hi>So then, the Truth it ſelf enforceth us to underſtand by (all Truths) not ſimply all, not all which God can poſſibly reveal, but all pertaining to the ſubſtance of Faith, all Truth abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> Mark what he ſaith.

So he may; and ſo he muſt, leſt otherwiſe he receive this anſwer of his own from himſelf, <hi>How many Truths lie unrevealed in the infinite Treaſury of God's wiſdom; wherewith the Church is not acquainted?</hi> And therefore to verifie ſuch general ſayings, they muſt be underſtood of Truths abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation. Are not theſe fearful conſequences? And yet D. <hi>Potter</hi> will never
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64345:72"/>be able to avoid them, till he come to acknowledge the infallibility of the Church in all Points by her propoſed as divine Truths; and thus it is univerſally true that ſhe is lead into all Truth, in regard that our Saviour never permits her to define, or teach any falſhood.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. All, that with any colour may be replyed to this Argument, is; That, if once we call any one Book, or parcel of Scripture in queſtion; although for the matter it contain no Fundamental error, yet it is of great importance and Fundamental, by reaſon of the conſequence; becauſe, if once we doubt of one Book received for Canonical, the whole Canon is made doubtful and uncertain, and therefore the infallibility of Scripture muſt be univerſal, and not confined within compaſs of Points Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. I anſwer: For the thing it ſelf it is very true, that if I doubt of any one parcel of Scripture receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſuch, I may doubt of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thence by the ſame parity I infer, that, if we did doubt of the Churches infallibility in ſome Points, we could nor believe her in any one, and conſequently not in propounding <hi>Canonical</hi> Books, or any other Points Fundamental, or not Fundamental; which thing being moſt abſurd, and withal moſt impious, we muſt take away the ground thereof, and believe that ſhe cannot err in any Point great or ſmall: and ſo this reply doth much more ſtrengthen what we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to prove. Yet I add, that Proteſtants cannot make uſe of this reply with any good coherence to this their diſtinction, and ſome other Doctrines which they defend. For, if D. <hi>Potter</hi> can tell what Points in particular be Fundamental (as in his 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> he pretendeth) then he might be ſure, that whenſoever he meets with ſuch Points in Scripture, in them, it is infallibly <hi>true,</hi> although it may err in others: and not only <hi>true</hi> but <hi>clear,</hi> becauſe Proteſtants teach, that, in matters neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Scripture is ſo clear, that all ſuch neceſſary Truths are either manifeſtly contained therein, or may be clearly deduced from it. Which Doctrines being put together, to wit: That Scriptures cannot err in Points Fundamental; that they clearly contain all ſuch Points; and that they can tell what Points in particular be ſuch, I mean Fundamental; it is manifeſt, that it is ſufficient for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Scripture be infallible only in Points Fundamental. For ſuppoſing theſe Doctrines of theirs to be true, they may be ſure to find in Scripture all Points neceſſary to Salvation, although it were fallible in other Points of leſs moment. Neither will they be able to avoid this impiety againſt holy Scripture, till they renounce their other Doctrines, and in particular, till they believe that Chriſt's promiſes to his Church, are not limited to Points Fundamental.</p>
                     <p n="16">16, Beſides, from the fallibility of Chriſt's Catholique Church in ſome Points, it followeth, that no true Proteſtant, learned or unlearned, doth or can with aſſurance believe the univerſal Church in any one Point of Doctrine. Not in Points of leſſer moment, which they call <hi>not-Fundamental;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe that in ſuch Points ſhe may err. Not in <hi>Fundamental;</hi> becauſe they muſt know what Points be Fundamental, before they go to learn of her, leſt otherwiſe they be rather deluded, than inſtructed; in regard that her certain, and infallible direction extends only to Points Fundamental.

For without ſuch a Catalogue, no man can be aſſured whether or no be have Faith ſufficient to Salvation. And therefore take it not in all part, if we again and again de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſuch a Catalogue. And that you may ſee we proceed fairly, I will perform, on our behalf, what we requeſt of you, and do here deliver a Catalogue, wherein are compriſed all Points by us taught to be neceſſary to Salvation in theſe words; <hi>We are obliged under pain of damnation, to believe whatſoever the Catholique Viſible Church of Chriſt propoſeth, as revealed by Almighty God.</hi> If any be of another mind, all Catholiques denounce him to be no Catholique. But enough of this. And I go forward with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church in all Points.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. For, even out of your own Doctrin, that the Church cannot err in Points neceſſary to Salvation, any wiſe man will infer, that it behoves all who have care of their ſouls, not to forſake her in any one Point. 1. Becauſe they are aſſured, that although her Doctrine proved not to be true, in ſome Point, yet, even according to D. <hi>Potter,</hi> the Error cannot be Fundamental, nor deſtructive of Faith, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: neither can they be accuſed of any the leaſt imprudence, in erring (if it were poſſible) with the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church. Secondly, ſince ſhe is, under pain of eternal damnation, to be believed, and obeyed in ſome things, wherein confeſſedly ſhe is indued with infallibility; I cannot in wiſdom ſuſpect her cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in matters of leſs moment. For who would truſt another in matters of higheſt conſequence, and be afraid to relie on him in things of leſs moment? Thirdly, ſince (as I ſaid) we are undoubtedly obliged not to forſake her in the chiefeſt, or Fundamental Points; and that there is no Rule to know preciſely what, and how many thoſe Fundamental Points be; I cannot without hazard of my ſoul leave her in any one Point, leſt perhaps that Point, or Points, wherein I forſake her, prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be Fundamental, and neceſſary to Salvation. Fourthly, that Viſible Church, which cannot
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64345:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>err in Points Fundamental, doth without diſtinction propound all her Definitions concerning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith to be believed under Anathema's or Curſes, eſteeming all thoſe who reſiſt, to be deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly caſt out of her Communion, and holding it a Point neceſſary to Salvation, that we believe ſhe cannot err: wherein if she ſpeak true, then to deny any one point in <hi>particular,</hi> which ſhe defineth, or to affirm in <hi>general,</hi> that ſhe may err, puts a man into a ſtate of damnation. Whereas to believe her in ſuch Points as are not neceſſary to Salvation, cannot endanger Salvation; and likewiſe to remain in her Communion, can bring no great harm, becauſe ſhe cannot maintain any damnable error, or practice: but to be divided from her (the being Chriſt's Catholique Church) is moſt certainly damnable. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the true Church, being in lawful and certain poſſeſſion of Superiority and Power, to command and require Obedience, from all Chriſtians in ſome things; I cannot without grievous ſin withdraw my obedience in any one, unleſs I evidently know, that the thing commanded comes not within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of thoſe things to which her Power extendeth. And who can better inform me, how far God's Church can proceed, than God's Church her ſelf? Or to what Doctor can the Children and Scholars, with greater reaſon, and more ſecurity flye for direction, than to the <hi>Mother,</hi> and appointed <hi>Teacher</hi> of all Chriſtians? In following her, I ſhall ſooner be excuſed, than in cleaving to any particular Sect, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, teaching or applying Scriptures againſt her Doctrin, or Interpretation. Sixthly, the fearful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of innumerable perſons, who, forſaking the Church upon pretence of her Errors, have failed even in Fundamental Points, and ſuffered ſhipwrack of their Salvation, ought to deter all Chriſtians from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing her in any one Doctrin, or practice: as (to omit other, both ancient and modern hereſies) we ſee that divers chief Proteſtants, pretending to reform the corruptions of the Church, are come to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that for many ages ſhe erred to death, and wholly periſhed; which D. <hi>Potter</hi> cannot deny to be a Fundamental Error againſt that Article of our Creed, <hi>I believe the Catholique Church,</hi> as he affirmeth it of the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> becauſe they confined the Univerſal Church within <hi>Africa,</hi> or ſome other ſmall tract of ſoil. Leſt therefore I may fall into ſome Fundamental Error, it is moſt ſafe for me to believe all the Decrees of that Church which cannot err fundamentally: eſpecially it we add, That, according to the Doctrin of Catholique Divines, one error in Faith, whether it be for the matter it ſelf, great or ſmall, deſtroys Faith, as is ſhewed in <hi>Charity Miſtaken;</hi> and conſequently to accuſe the Church of any one Error, is to affirm, that ſhe loſt all Faith, and erred damnably: which very ſaying is damnable, becauſe it leaves Chriſt no viſible Church on earth.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. To all theſe Arguments I add this Demonſtration: D. <hi>Potter</hi> teacheth, that <hi>there neither was</hi>
                        <note n="(c)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Pag.</hi> 75.</note> 
                        <hi>nor can be any juſt cauſe to depart from the Church of Chriſt, no more than from Chriſt himſelf.</hi> But if the Church of Chriſt can err in ſome Points of Faith, men not only may, but muſt forſake her in thoſe, (unleſs D. <hi>Potter</hi> will have them to believe one thing, and profeſs another:) and if ſuch errors and corruptions ſhould fall out to be about the Churches Liturgy, publique Service, adminiſtration of Sacraments, &amp; the like; they who perceive ſuch errors, muſt of neceſſity leave her external Communion. And therefore, if once we grant the Church may err, it followeth that men may, and ought to forſake her (which is againſt D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s own words,) or elſe they are inexcuſable who left the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of errors, which they grant not to be Fundamental. And, if D. <hi>Potter</hi> think good to anſwer this argument, he muſt remember his own Doctrin to be, that even the Catholique Church may err in Points not Fundamental.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. Another argument for the univerſal Infallibility of the Church, I take out of D. <hi>Potter's</hi> own words. <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we</hi>
                        <note n="(d)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Pag.</hi> 97.</note> 
                        <hi>did not diſſent in ſome opinions from the preſent</hi> Roman <hi>Church, we could not agree with the Church truly Catholique.</hi> Theſe words cannot be true, unleſs he preſuppoſe that the <hi>Church truly Catholique,</hi> cannot err in Points not Fundamental.

I urge the words of Scripture which are univerſal, and do not mention any ſuch reſtraint. I alledge that moſt reaſonable, and Received Rule, that Scripture is to be underſtood literally, as it ſoundeth, unleſs ſome manifeſt abſurdity force us to the contrary. But all will not ſerve, to accord our different interpretation. In the mean time divers of D. <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Brethren ſtep in, and reject his limitation, as over-large, and ſomewhat taſting of Papiſtry:
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64345:74"/>And therefore they reſtrain the mentioned Texts, either to the Infallibility which the Apoſtles, and other ſacred Writers had in penning of Scripture: or elſe to the <hi>inviſible</hi> Church of the Elect; and to them, not abſolutely, but with a double reſtriction, that they ſhall not fall <hi>damnably,</hi> and <hi>finally;</hi> and other men have as much right as theſe, to interpoſe their opinion and interpretation. Behold we are three at debate about the ſelfeſame words of Scripture: We confer divers places and Texts: We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Originals: We examine Tranſlations: We endeavour to pray heartily: We profeſs to ſpeak ſincerely: To ſeek nothing but Truth, and Salvation of our own ſouls, and that of our Neighbours; and finally, we uſe all thoſe means, which by Proteſtants themſelves are preſcribed for finding out the true meaning of Scripture: Nevertheleſs we neither do, or have any poſſible means to agree, as long as we are left to our ſelves; and when we ſhould chance to be agreed, the doubt would ſtill remain whether the thing it ſelf be a <hi>Fundamental</hi> Point or no: And yet it were great impiety to imagine that God, the lover of Souls, hath left no certain infallible means, to decide both this, and all other differences ariſing about the interpretation of Scripture, or upon any other occaſion. Our remedy therefore in theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions muſt be, to conſult, and hear Gods Viſible Church, with ſubmiſſive acknowledgment of her Power, and Infallibility in whatſoever the propoſeth as a revealed Truth: according to that divine advice of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in theſe words: <hi>If at length</hi>

                        <p n="1">1 <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Diſtinction is imployed by Proteſtants to many purpoſes, and therefore, if it be pertinent and good, (as they underſtand and apply it) the whole edifice built thereon, muſt be either firme and ſtable; or, if it be not, it cannot be for any default in this Diſtinction.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>If you object to them diſcords in matter of Faith without any means of agreement,</hi> They will anſwer you, that they want not good and ſolid means of agreement in matters neceſſary to Salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> Their beliefe of all thoſe things which are plainly and undoubtedly delivered in Scripture, which who ſo believes, muſt of neceſſity believe all things neceſſary to Salvation: and their mutual ſuffering one another <hi>to abound in their ſeveral ſenſe,</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not plainly and undoubtedly there delivered. And for their agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all Controverſies of Religion, either they have means to agree about them, or not: If you ſay they have, why did you before deny it? If they have not means, why do you find fault with them, for not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing?</p>
                        <p n="3">3. You will ſay, that their fault is, that <hi>by remaining Proteſtants, they exclude themſelves from the means of agreement, which you have,</hi> and which by ſubmiſſion to your Church they might have alſo. But if you have means of agreement, the more ſhame for you that you ſtil diſagree. For who, I pray, is more inexcuſably guilty, for the omiſſion of any duty; they that either have no means to do it, or elſe know of none they have, which puts them in the ſame caſe, if as they had none: or they which profeſſe to have an eaſie and expedite means to do it, and yet ſtill leave it undone? <hi>If you had been blind</hi> (ſaith our <hi>Saviour</hi> to the <hi>Phariſees</hi>) <hi>you had had no ſin; but now you ſay you ſee, therefore your ſin remaineth.</hi>

                           <pb n="116" facs="tcp:64345:75"/>
4. If you ſay, you <hi>do agree in matters of Faith,</hi> I ſay this is ridiculous, for you define matters of Faith to be thoſe wherein you agree. So that to ſay, you agree in <hi>matters of Faith,</hi> is to ſay, you agree in thoſe things wherein you do agree. And do not Proteſtants do ſo likewiſe? Do not they agree in thoſe things, wherein they do agree?</p>
                        <p n="5">5. But <hi>you are all agreed, that only thoſe things wherein you do agree are matters of Faith.</hi> And Proteſtants, if they were wiſe, would do ſo too. Sure I am they have reaſon enough to do ſo: ſeeing all of them agree with expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Faith in all thoſe things, which are plainly and undoubtedly delivered in Scripture, that is, in all which God hath plainly revealed: and with an implicite Faith, in that ſenſe of the whole Scripture which God intended whatſoever was. Secondly, That which you pretend is falſe; for elſe, why do ſome of you hold it againſt faith, to take or allow the <hi>Oath of Allegiance;</hi> others as learned and honeſt as they, that it is againſt Faith and unlawful to refuſe it, and allow the refuſing of it? Why do ſome of you hold, that it is <hi>de Fide,</hi> that the Pope is Head of the Church by divine Law, others the contrary? Some hold it <hi>de Fide,</hi> that the bleſſed Virgin was free from Actual ſin, others that it is not ſo. Some, that the Popes Indirect power over Princes in Temporalties is <hi>de Fide,</hi> Others the contrary. Some, that it is Univerſal Tradition, and conſéquently <hi>de Fide,</hi> that the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> was conceived in original ſin, Others the contrary.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. But what ſhall we ſay now, if you be not agreed touching your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended means of Agreement, how then can you pretend to Unity either Actual or Potential more than Proteſtants may? Some of you ſay, the Pope alone without a Councel may determine all Controverſies: But others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it. Some, that a general Councel without a Pope may do ſo: Others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this. Some, Both in conjunction are infallible determiners: Others again deny this. Laſtly, ſome among you, hold the Acceptation of the Decrees of Councels by the Univerſal Church to be the only way to decide Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies: which others deny, by denying the Church to be Infallible. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, what way of ending Controverſies can this be, when either part may pretend, that they are part of the Church, and they receive not the Decree, therefore the whole Church hath not received it?</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Again, Means of agreeing differences are either rational and well-grounded, and of Gods appointment; or voluntary and taken up at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of men. Means of the former nature, we ſay, you have as little as we. For where hath God appointed, that the Pope, or a Councel, or a Councel confirmed by the Pope, or that Society of Chriſtians which adhere to him, ſhall be the <hi>Infallible Judge of Controverſies?</hi> I deſire you to ſhew any one of theſe Aſſertions plainly ſet down in Scripture, (as in all reaſon a thing of this nature ſhould be) or at leaſt delivered with a full conſent of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or at leaſt taught in plain tearms by any one Father for four hundred yeers after Chriſt. And if you cannot do this (as I am ſure you cannot) and yet will ſtill be obtruding your ſelves upon us for our Judges, Who will not cry out,

And if you ſay, Theſe would fail us and contradict themſelves: So, as we pretend, have yours.

So that ſtill you proceed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning others for your own faults, and urging Arguments againſt us, which return more ſtrongly upon your ſelves.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. But your will is, <hi>We ſhould remember that Chriſt muſt alwaies have a Viſible Church.</hi> Anſ. Your pleaſure ſhall be obeyed, on condition you will not forget, that there is a difference between perpetual Viſibility, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Purity. As for the Anſwer which you make for us, true it is, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Catholique Church cannot periſh,</hi> yet that ſhe may, and did, erre in Points not Fundamental; and that Proteſtants were obliged to forſake theſe errors of the Church, as they did, though not the Church for her errors, for that they did not, but continued ſtill Members of the Church. For it is not all one (though you perpetually confound them) <hi>to forſake the errors of the Church,</hi> and to <hi>forſake the Church:</hi> or to <hi>forſake the Church in her error,</hi> and <hi>ſimply to forſake the Church:</hi> no more then it is for me to renounce my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or my Friends Vices or Errors, and to renounce my Brother or my Friend. The former then was done by Proteſtants, the latter was not done. Nay not only, not from the Catholique, but not ſo much as from the <hi>Roman,</hi> did they ſeparate <hi>peromnia;</hi> but only in thoſe practices which they conceived ſuperſtitious or impious. If you would at this time propoſe a form of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, which both Sides hold lawful, and then they would not joyn with you in this Liturgy, you might have ſome colour then to ſay, they renounce your Communion abſolutely. But as things are now ordered, they cannot joyne with you in Prayers, but they muſt partake with with you in unlawful practices, and for this reaſon, they <hi>(not abſolutely, but thus farre)</hi> ſeparate from your Communion. And this, I ſay, they were obliged to do under pain of damnation. <hi>Not as if it were damnable to hold an error not damnable,</hi> but becauſe it is damnable outwardly to profeſs and maintain it, and to joyn with others in the practice of it, when inwardly they did not hold it. Now had they continued in your Communion, that they muſt have done, <hi>viz.</hi> have profeſſed to believe, and externally practiſed your Errors, whereof they were convinced that they were Errors: which, though the matters of the Errors had been not neceſſary, but only profitable, whether it had not been damnable diſſimulation and hypocriſie, I leave it to you to judge. You your ſelf tell us within two pages after this, <hi>That you are obliged, never to ſpeak any one leaſt lye againſt your knowledge,</hi> §. 2. Now what is this but to live in a perpetual lye?</p>
                        <p n="12">12. As for that which in the next place you ſeem ſo to wonder at, That <hi>both Catholiques and Proteſtants, according to the opinion of Proteſtants, may be ſaved in their ſeveral profeſsions, becauſe, forſooth, we both agree in all Fundamental points.</hi> I Anſwer, this Propoſition ſo crudely ſet down, as you have here ſet it down, I know no Proteſtant will juſtifie. For you ſeem to make them teach, that it is an indifferent thing, for the attainment of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether a man believe the Truth or the Falſhood; and that they care not in whether of theſe Religions a man live or dye, ſo he dye in either of them: whereas all that they ſay is this, That thoſe amongſt you which want means to find the Truth, and ſo dye in Error; or uſe the beſt means they can with induſtry, and without partiality to find the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:64345:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>Truth, and yet dye in error, theſe men, thus qualified, notwithſtanding theſe errors may be ſaved. Secondly, for thoſe that have means to find the Truth, and will not uſe them, they conceive, though their caſe be dangerous, yet if they die with a general repentance for all their ſins, known and unknown, their Salvation is not deſperate. The Truths which they hold of Faith in Chriſt, and Repentance, being as it were an Antidote againſt their Errors, and their negligence in ſeeking the Truth. Eſpecially, ſeeing by confeſſion of both ſides we agree in much more than is ſimply, and indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. <hi>But ſeeing we make ſuch various uſe of this Diſtinction, is it not prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſtrange that we will never be induced to give in a particular Catalogue what points be Fundamental?</hi> And why, I pray, is it ſo <hi>predigiouſly ſtrange,</hi> that we give no anſwer to an unreaſonable demand? God himſelf hath told us,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Luk 22.48.</note> 
                           <hi>That where much is given, much ſhall be required; where little is given, little ſhall be required.</hi> To Infants, Deaf-men, Mad-men, nothing, for ought we know, is given; and if it be ſo, of them <hi>nothing</hi> ſhall be required. Others perhaps may have means only given them to believe,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> 
                           <hi>That God is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that ſeek him;</hi> and to whom thus much only is given, to them it ſhal not be damnable, that they believe but only thus much. Which me thinks is very manifeſt from the Apoſtle, in the <hi>Epiſtle to the Hebrews,</hi> where having firſt ſaid, <hi>That without Faith it is impoſsible to pleaſe God,</hi> he ſubjoyns as his reaſon, <hi>For whoſoever cometh unto God, muſt believe that God is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that ſeek him.</hi> Where, in my opinion, this is plainly intimated, that this is the <hi>minimum quod ſic,</hi> the loweſt degree of Faith, wherewith, in men capable of Faith, God will be pleaſed: and that with this loweſt degree he will be pleaſed, where means of riſing higher are deficient. Beſides, if without this belief, <hi>That God is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that ſeek him,</hi> God will not be pleaſed, then his will is, that we ſhould believe it. Now his will it cannot be, that we ſhould believe a Falſhood, It muſt be therefore true, that he is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of them that ſeek him. Now it is poſſible, that they which never heard of Chriſt, may ſeek God: therefore it is true, that even they ſhall pleaſe him, and be rewarded by him; I ſay, rewarded, not with bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them immediately to Salvation without Chriſt, but with bringing them according to his good pleaſure, firſt, to Faith in Chriſt, and ſo to Salvation. To which belief the Story of <hi>Cornelius</hi> in the 10. <hi>Chapter of the Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, and S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s words to him, are to me a great inducement. For firſt it is evident he believed not in Chriſt, but was a meer Gentile, and one that knew not but men might be worſhipped, and yet we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured <hi>that his prayers and alms</hi> (even while he was in that ſtate) <hi>came up for a memorial before God; That his prayer was heard, and his Alms had in remembrance in the ſight of God,</hi> ver. 4. That upon his <hi>Then fearing God, and working righteouſneſs,</hi> (ſuch as it was) <hi>he was accepted with God.</hi> But how accepted? Not to be brought immediately to Salvation, but to be promoted to a higher degree of the knowledg of Gods will: For ſo it is in the 4. and 5. v. <hi>Call for</hi> Simon <hi>whoſe ſirname is</hi> Peter, <hi>he ſhall tell thee what thou oughteſt to do:</hi> and at the 33. v. <hi>We are all here preſent before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</hi> So that though even in his Gentiliſm, he was accepted in his preſent ſtate, yet if he had continued in it, &amp; refuſed to believe in Chriſt after the ſufficient revelation of the Goſpel
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64345:77"/>to him, and God's will to have him believe it, he that was accepted before, would not have continued accepted ſtill; for then that condemnation had come upon him, <hi>That light was come unto him, and he loved darkneſs more than light.</hi> So that (to proceed a ſtep farther) to whom Faith in Chriſt is ſufficiently propounded, as neceſſary to Salvation, to them it is ſimply neceſſary and fundamental to believe in Chriſt, that is, to expect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins and Salvation from him, upon the performance of the conditions he requires; among which conditions one is, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what he hath revealed, when it is ſufficiently declared, to have been revealed by him: For by doing ſo, <hi>we ſet to our ſeal, that God is true, and that Chriſt was ſent by him.</hi> Now that may be ſufficiently decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to one (all things conſidered,) which (all things conſidered) to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not ſufficiently declared: and conſequently that may be fundamental and neceſſary to one, which to another is not ſo. Which variety of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, makes it impoſſible to ſet down an exact Catalogue of Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, and proves your requeſt as reaſonable, as if you ſhould deſire us (according to the Fable) to make a coat to fit the Moon in all her changes; or to give you a garment that will fit all ſtatures; or to make you a Dial to ſerve all Meridians; or to deſign particularly, what proviſion will ſerve an Army for a year: whereas there may be an Army of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, there may be of one hundred thouſand. And therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſetting down a Catalogue of Fundamentals in particular, (becauſe none that can be given, can univerſally ſerve for all men, God requiring more of them to whom he gives more, and leſs of them to whom he gives leſs) we muſt content our ſelves by a general deſcription to tell you what is Fundamental. And to warrant us in doing ſo, we have your own example §. 19. where being engaged to give us a Catalogue of Fundamentals, inſtead thereof you tell us only in general, <hi>That all is Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, and not to be disbelieved under pain of damnation, which the Church hath defined.</hi> As you therefore think it enough to ſay in general, <hi>That all is fundamental which the Church hath defined,</hi> without ſetting down in particular a compleat Catalogue of all things, which in any Age the Church hath defined (which, I believe, you will not undertake to do; and, if you do, it will be contradicted by your Fellows:) So in reaſon you might think it enough for us alſo to ſay in general, <hi>That it is ſufficient for any mans ſalvation to believe that the Scripture is true, and contains all things neceſſary for ſalvation; and to do his beſt endeavour to find and believe the true ſenſe of it:</hi> without delivering any particular Catalogue of the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of Faith.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Neither <hi>doth the want of ſuch a Catalogue</hi> leave us in ſuch a <hi>perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed uncertainty</hi> as you pretend. For though perhaps we cannot exactly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh in the Scripture, what <hi>is revealed becauſe it is neceſſary,</hi> from what is <hi>neceſſary, conſequently and accidentally, meerly becauſe it is revealed:</hi> yet we are ſure enough, that all that is neceſſary any way, is there; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in believing all that is there, we are ſure to believe all that is neceſſary. And if we err from the true &amp; intended ſenſe of ſome, nay of many obſcure and ambiguous Texts of Scripture, yet we may be ſure enough, that we err not damnably: becauſe, if we do indeed deſire and endeavour to find the Truth, we may be ſure we do ſo, and as ſure that it cannot conſiſt with the revealed goodneſs of God, to damn him for error, that deſires and indeavours to find the Truth.</p>

15. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 2. The effect of this Paragraph (for as much as concerns us) is this, That <hi>for any man to deny belief to any one thing, be it great or ſmall, known by him, to be revealed by Almighty God for a Truth, is in effect to charge God with falſhood: for it is to ſay, that God affirms that to be Truth, which he either knows to be not a Truth, or which he doth not know to be a Truth: and therefore without all controverſie this is a damnable ſin.</hi> To this I ſubſcribe with hand and heart: adding withall, that not only he which knows, but he which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves (nay, though it be erroneouſly) any thing to be revealed by God, and yet will not believe it nor aſſent unto it, is in the ſame caſe, and commits the ſame ſin of derogation from Gods moſt perfect and pure Veracity.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 3. I ſaid purpoſely <hi>(known by himſelf, and believes himſelf)</hi> For as, without any diſparagement of a mans honeſty, I may believe ſomething to be falſe, which he affirms, of his certain knowledge to be true; provided I neither know nor believe that he hath ſo affirmed: So without any the leaſt diſhonour to Gods eternal never-failing veracity, I may doubt of, or deny ſome Truth revealed by him, if I neither know nor believe it to be revealed by him.</p>
                        <p n="17">17. Seeing therefore the crime of calling Gods Veracity into queſtion, and conſequently (according to your grounds) of erring Fundamentally, is chargeable upon thoſe only, that <hi>believe the contrary</hi> of any one <hi>point known (not by others, but themſelves) to be teſtified by God:</hi> I cannot but fear (though I hope otherwiſe) that your heart condemned you of a great calumny and egregious ſophiſtry in imputing Fundamental, and damnable Errors to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing Proteſtants; Becauſe forfooth, <hi>ſome of them disbelieve, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, wittingly, and willingly oppoſe, what others do believe to be teſtified by the Word of God:</hi> The ſophiſtry of your Diſcourſe will be apparent, if it be contrived into a Syllogiſm: Thus therefore in effect you argue;</p>
                        <p>Whoſoever disbelieves any thing known by himſelf to be revealed by God imputes falſhood to God, and therefore errs fundamentally:</p>
                        <p>But ſome Proteſtants disbelieve thoſe things, which Others believe to be teſtified by God;</p>
                        <p>Therefore they impute falſhood to God, and err Fundamentally.</p>
                        <p>Neither can you with any colour pretend, that in theſe words <hi>known to be teſtified by God,</hi> you meant, <hi>not by himſelf, but by any other:</hi> Seeing he only in fact affirms, that God doth deceive or is deceived, who denyes ſome things which himſelf knows or believes to be revealed by God, as before I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated. For otherwiſe, if I ſhould deny belief to ſome things which God had revealed ſecretly to ſuch a man as I had never heard of, I ſhould be guilty of calling Gods Veracity into Queſtion, which is evidently falſe. Beſides, how can it be avoided, but the Jeſuits and Dominicans and Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans muſt upon this ground differ Fundamentally, and one of them err dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, ſeeing the one of them disbelieves, and willingly oppoſes, what the others believe to be the Word of God?</p>
                        <p n="18">18. Whereas you ſay, that <hi>The difference among Proteſtants conſiſts not in this, that ſome believe ſome points, of which others are ignorant, or not bound expreſly to know:</hi> I would gladly know, whether you ſpeak of Proteſtants dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering <hi>in profeſsion only, or in opinion alſo.</hi> If the firſt, why do you ſay pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after, <hi>that ſome disbelieve, what others of them believe?</hi> If they differ in opinion, then ſure they are ignorant of the truth of each others opinions: it being impoſſible and contradictious, that a man ſhould know one thing
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64345:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>to be true, and believe the contrary; or know it, and not believe it. And if they do not know the truth of each others opinions, then, I hope, you will grant they are ignorant of it. If your meaning were, they <hi>were not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that each other held theſe Opinions, or of the ſenſe of the opinions which they held;</hi> I anſwer, This is nothing to the convincing of their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the truth of them; and theſe remaining unconvinced of the truth of them, they are excuſable if they do not believe.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. But, ignorance of what we are expreſly bound to know, is it ſelf a fault, and therefore cannot be an excuſe: and therefore if you could ſhew, that Proteſtants differ in thoſe points, the truth whereof (which can be but one) they were bound expreſly to know, I ſhould eaſily yield that one ſide muſt of neceſſity be in a mortal crime. But for want of proof of this, you content your ſelf only to ſay it; and therefore I alſo might be contented only to deny it, yet I will not, but give a reaſon for my denyal. And my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe our Obligation expreſly to know any Divine Truth, muſt ariſe from Gods manifeſt revealing of it, and his revealing unto us that he hath revealed it, and that his will is, we ſhould believe it: Now in the Points controverted among Proteſtants, he hath not ſo dealt with us, therefore he hath not laid any ſuch Obligation upon us. The Major of this Syllogiſm is evident, and therefore I will not ſtand to prove it. The Minor alſo will be evident to him that conſiders, That in all the Controverſies of Proteſtants, there is a ſeeming conflict of Scripture with Scripture, Reaſon with Reaſon, Authority with Authority: which how it can conſiſt with the manifeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing of the truth of either Side, I cannot well underſtand. Beſides, though we grant that Scripture, Reaſon, and Authority, were all on one ſide, and the appearances of the other ſide all eaſily anſwerable: yet if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſtrange power that Education, and Prejudices inſtilled by it, have over even excellent underſtandings, we may well imagine, that many truths which in themſelves are revealed plainly enough, are yet to ſuch or ſuch a man, prepoſſeſt with contrary opinions, not revealed plainly. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doubt I but God, who knows whereof we are made, and what paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we are ſubject unto, will compaſſionate ſuch infirmities, and not enter into judgment with us for thoſe things, which, all things conſidered, were unavoidable.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. <hi>But till Fundamentals</hi> (ſay you) <hi>be ſufficiently propoſed (as revealed by God) is is not againſt Faith to reject them; or rather, it is not poſsible, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to believe them: And points unfundamental being thus ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as divne Truths, may not be denyed: Therefore you conclude, there is no difference between them. Anſw.</hi> A Circumſtantial point may by accident become Fundamental, becauſe it may be ſo propoſed, that the denyal of it, will draw after it the denyal of this Fundamental truth, <hi>That all which God ſays is true.</hi> Notwithſtanding in themſelves there is a main difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them: <hi>Points fundamental being thoſe only which are revealed by God, and commanded to be preacht to all, and believed by all. Points Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, being ſuch, as though God hath revealed them, yet the Paſtors of the Church are not bound under pain of damnation particularly to teach them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men every where, and the people may be ſecurely ignorant of them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="21">21. You ſay, <hi>Not erring in points fundamental, is not ſufficient for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Church; becauſe any Error maintained by it againſt Gods Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation is deſtructive.</hi> I anſwer. If you mean againſt Gods revelation known
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64345:78"/>by the Church to be ſo, it is true; but impoſſible that the Church ſhould ſhould do ſo; for <hi>ipſo Facto</hi> in doing it, it were a Church no longer. But, if you mean againſt ſome Revelation, which the Church by error thinks to be no Revelation, it is falſe. The Church may ignorantly dis-believe ſuch a Revelation, and yet continue a Church; which thus I prove: That the Goſpel was to be preached to all Nations, was a Truth revealed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour's Aſcenſion, in theſe words, <hi>Go and teach all Nations,</hi> Mat. 28.19. Yet through prejudice or inadvertence, or ſome other cauſe, the Church disbelieved it, as it is apparent out of the 11. and 12. Chap. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> until the converſion of <hi>Cornelius;</hi> and yet was ſtill a Church. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to disbelieve ſome divine Revelation, not knowing it to be ſo, is not deſtructive of ſalvation, or of the being of the Church. Again, it is a plain Revelation of God, that<note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.28.</note> the Sacrament of the Euchariſt <hi>ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in both kinds:</hi> and<note n="(b)" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.15, 16, 26.</note> that the publique Hymns and <hi>Prayers of the Church ſhould be in ſuch a language as is moſt for edification;</hi> yet theſe Revelations the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> not ſeeing, by reaſon of the veil before their eye, their Churches ſuppoſed Infallibility; I hope, the denial of them ſhall not be laid to their charge, no otherwiſe than as building hay and ſtubble on the Foundation, not overthrowing the Foundation it ſelf.</p>
                        <p n="22">22. <hi>Ad</hi> § 2. In the beginning of this Paragraph, we have this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt this Diſtinction; <hi>It is enough</hi> (<hi>by D.</hi> Potter<hi>'s confeſsion</hi>) <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ſome things negatively,</hi> i.e. <hi>not to deny them; Therefore all denial of any divine truth excludes Salvation.</hi> As if you ſhould ſay, One Horſe is enough for a man to go a journey: Therefore without a Horſe no man can go a journey. As if ſome Divine Truths, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe which are plainly revealed, might not be ſuch, as of neceſſity were not to be denied: and others, for want of ſufficient declaration, deniable without danger. Indeed, if D. <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> had ſaid there had been no divine Truth, declared ſufficiently or not declared, but muſt upon pain of damnation be believed, or at leaſt not deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; then might you juſtly have concluded as you do: but now, that ſome may not be denied, and that ſome may be denied without damnation, why they may not both ſtand together, I do not yet underſtand.</p>
                        <p n="23">23. In the remainder you infer out of D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s wórds, <hi>That all errors are alike damnable, if the manner of propounding the contrary Truths be not different:</hi> which, for ought I know, all Proteſtants, and all that have ſenſe muſt grant. Yet I deny your Illation from hence, That <hi>the diſtinction of points into Fundamental and Unfundamental, is vain and uneffectual for the purpoſe of Proteſtants.</hi> For though being alike propoſed as divine Truths, they are by accident alike neceſſary, yet the real difference ſtill remains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, that they are not alike neceſſary to be propoſed.</p>
                        <p n="24">24. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 5. The next Paragraph, if it be brought out of the clouds, will, I believe, have in it theſe Propoſitions.

                              <item>2. <hi>The Nature of Faith is taken, not from the matter believed, for then they that believed different matters ſhould haue different Faiths, but from the Motive to it.</hi>

                              <item>3. <hi>This Motive is Gods Revelation.</hi>

Which is truly a very proper and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Argument to cloſe up a weak Diſcourſe, wherein both the Propoſitions are falſe for matter, confuſed and diſordered for the form, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64345:79"/>utterly inconſequent. Firſt, for the ſecond Propoſition; Who knows not that the Eſſence of all Habits (and therefore of Faith among the reſt) is taken from their Act, and their Object? If the Habit be general, from the Act and Object in general; if the Habit be ſpecial, from the Act and Object in ſpecial. Then for the Motive to a thing; that it cannot be of the Eſſence of the thing to which it moves, who can doubt that knows that a Motive is an efficient cauſe, and that the efficient is always extrinſecal to the effect? For the fourth, that <hi>Gods Revelation is alike for all objects,</hi> It is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous: and if the ſenſe of it be, that his Revelation is an equal Motive to induce us to believe all objects revealed by him, it is true, but imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: If the ſenſe of it be, that all objects revealed by God are alike (that is, alike plainly and undoubtedly) revealed by him, it is pertinent, but moſt untrue. Witneſs the great diverſity of Texts of Scripture, whereof ſome are ſo plain and evident, that no man of ordinary ſenſe can miſtake the ſenſe of them. Some are ſo obſcure and ambiguous, that to ſay, this or this is the certain ſenſe of them, were high preſumption. For the fifth; <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants diſagree in things equally revealed by God!</hi> In themſelves perhaps, but not equally to them, whoſe underſtandings by reaſon of their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Educations are faſhioned, and ſhaped for the entertainment of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious opinions, and conſequently ſome of them, more enclined to believe ſuch a ſenſe of Scripture, others to believe another; which to ſay that God will not take into his conſideration in judging mens opinions, is to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparage his goodneſs. But to what purpoſe is it, that theſe things are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed to both, (as the light is equally revealed to all blind men) if they be not fully revealed to either? The ſenſe of this Scripture, <hi>Why are they then baptiz'd for the dead?</hi> and this, <hi>He ſhall be ſaved, yet ſo as by fire,</hi> and a thouſand others, are equally revealed to you and to another Interpreter, that is, certainly to neither. He now conceives one ſenſe of them, and you another; And would it not be an excellent Inference, if I ſhould conclude now as you do; That you forſake the formal motive of Faith, which is Gods Revelation, and conſequently loſe all Faith and Unity therein? So likewiſe the Jeſuits and Dominicans, the Franciſcans and Dominicans, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree about things equally revealed by Almighty God: and ſeeing they do ſo, I beſeech you let me underſtand, why this reaſon will not exclude them as well as Proteſtants <hi>from all Faith and Unity therein?</hi> Thus you have failed of your undertaking in your firſt part of your Title, and that is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill <hi>omen,</hi> eſpecially in points of ſo ſtreight mutual dependance, that we ſhall have but ſlender performance in your ſecond Aſſumpt. Which is, <hi>That the Church is infallible in all her Definitions, whether concerning Points Fundamental, or not Fundamental.</hi>

                        <p n="26">26. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 9, 10, 11. I grant that the Church <hi>cannot without damnable ſin, either deny any thing to be true, which ſhe knows to be Gods Truth:</hi> or propoſe <hi>any thing as his Truth, which ſhe knows not to be ſo.</hi> But that ſhe may not do this by ignorance or miſtake, and ſo without damnable ſin, that you ſhould have proved, but have not. But, ſay you, <hi>This excuſe cannot ſerve: for if the Church be aſsiſted only for Points Fundamental, ſhe cannot but know that ſhe may err in points not Fundamental.</hi> Anſw. It does not follow,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64345:79"/>unleſs you ſuppoſe, that the Church knows that ſhe is aſſiſted no farther. But if, being aſſiſted only ſo far, ſhe yet did conceive by errour her aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance abſolute and unlimited, or, if knowing her aſſiſtance reſtrained to Fundamentals, ſhe yet conceived by errour, that ſhe ſhould be guarded, from propoſing any thing but what was fundamental, then the conſequence is apparently falſe. <hi>But at leaſt ſhe cannot be certain that ſhe cannot err, and therefore cannot be excuſed from headlong and pernicious temerity in propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing points not fundamental, to be believed by Chriſtians as matters of Faith.</hi> Anſ. Neither is this deduction worth any thing, unleſs it be underſtood of ſuch unfundamental points, as ſhe is not warranted to propoſe by evident Text of Scripture. Indeed, if ſhe propoſe ſuch, as <hi>matters of Faith certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true,</hi> ſhe may well be queſtioned, <hi>Quo Warranto?</hi> She builds without a foundation, and <hi>ſays, Thus ſaith the Lord, when the Lord doth not ſay ſo:</hi> which cannot be excuſed from raſhneſs and high preſumption; ſuch a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, as an Embaſſadour ſhould commit, who ſhould ſay in his Maſters name that for which he hath no Commiſſion; Of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I ſay, but of a higher ſtrain: as much as the King of Heaven, is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any earthly King. But though ſhe may err in ſome points not-fundamental, yet may ſhe have certainty enough in propoſing others; as for example, theſe, <hi>That Abraham begat Iſaac,</hi> that S. <hi>Paul had a cloak,</hi> that <hi>Timothy was ſick;</hi> becauſe theſe, though not Fundamental, <hi>i. e.</hi> no eſſential parts of Chriſtianity, yet are evidently, and undeniably ſet down in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and conſequently, may be without all raſhneſs propoſed by the Church as certain divine Revelations. Neither is your Argument, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, when you ſay, <hi>If in ſuch things ſhe may be deceived, ſhe muſt be always uncertain of all ſuch things.</hi> For, my ſenſe may ſometimes poſſibly deceive me, yet I am certain enough that I ſee what I ſee, and feel what I feel. Our Judges are not infallible in their judgments, yet are they certain enough, that they judge aright, and that they proceed according to the Evidence that is given, when they condemn a Thief, or a murderer to the Gallows. A Traveller is not always certain of his way, but often miſtaken: and doth it therefore follow that he can have no aſſurance that <hi>Charing-croſs</hi> is his right way from the <hi>Temple</hi> to <hi>White-Hall?</hi> The ground of your Error here is your not diſtinguiſhing between Actual Certainty and Abſolute Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. Geometricians are not infallible in their own Science: yet they are very certain of thoſe things which they ſee demonſtrated. And Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are not Infallible, yet certain of the ſtraightneſs of thoſe things which agree with their Rule and Square. So though the Church be not infallibly certain, that in all her Definitions, whereof ſome are about diſputable and ambiguous matters, ſhe ſhall proceed according to her Rule; yet being certain of the Infallibility of her Rule, and that in this or that thing ſhe doth manifeſtly proceed according to it, ſhe may be certain of the Truth of ſome particular Decrees, and yet not certain that ſhe ſhall never decree but what is true.</p>
                        <p n="27">27. <hi>Ad</hi> § 12. <hi>But if the Church may err in points not fundamental, ſhe may err in propoſing Scripture, and ſo we cannot be aſſured whether ſhe have not been deceived already.</hi> The Church may err in her Propoſition or cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Canon of Scripture, if you underſtand by the Church, any preſent Church of one denomination; for example, the <hi>Roman,</hi> the <hi>Greek,</hi> or ſo. Yet have we ſufficient certainty of Scripture, not from the bare teſtimony
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64345:80"/>of any preſent Church, but from Univerſal Tradition, of which the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of any preſent Church is but a little part. So that here you fall into the Fallacy, <hi>à dicto ſecundum quid ad dictum ſimpliciter.</hi> For in effect this is the ſenſe of your Argument: Unleſs the Church be infallible, we can have no certainty of Scripture from the Authority of the Church: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unleſs the Church be infallible, we can have no certainty hereof at all. As if a man ſhould ſay, If the Vintage of <hi>France</hi> miſcarry, we can have no Wine from <hi>France:</hi> Therefore, if that Vintage miſcarry, we can have no Wine at all. And, for the incorruption of Scripture; I know no other ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional aſſurance we can have of it, than ſuch as we have of the incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of other ancient Books, that is, the conſent of ancient Copies: ſuch, I mean <hi>for the kind,</hi> though it be far <hi>greater for the degree of it.</hi> And if the Spirit of God give any man any other Aſſurance hereof, this is not rational and diſcurſive, but ſupernatural and infuſed. And Aſſurance it may be to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but no Argument to another. As for the infallibility of the Church; it is ſo far from being a proof of Scriptures Incorruption, that no proof can be pretended for it, but incorrupted places of Scripture: which yet are as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to corruption as any other, and more likely to have been corrupted (if it had been poſſible) than any other, and made to ſpeak as they do, for the advantage of thoſe men, whoſe ambition it hath been a long time, to bring all under their Authority. Now then, if any man ſhould prove the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures uncorrupted, becauſe the Church ſays ſo, which is infallible: I would demand again touching this very thing, That there is an Infallible Church, ſeeing it is not of it ſelf evident, how ſhall I be aſſured of it? And what can he anſwer, but that the Scripture ſays ſo, in theſe and theſe places? Hereupon I would ask him, how ſhall I be aſſured, that the Scriptures are incorrupted in theſe places? ſeeing it is poſſible, and not altogether impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that theſe men, which deſire to be thought Infallible, when they had the government of all things in their own hands, may have altered them for their purpoſe. If to this he anſwer again, that the Church is infallible, and therefore cannot do ſo; I hope it would be apparent, that he runs round in a circle, and proves the Scriptures incorruption, by the Churches infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, and the Churches infallibility, by the Scriptures incorruption; and that is in effect the Churches infallibility by the Churches infallibility, and the Scriptures incorruption by the Scriptures incorruption.</p>
                        <p n="28">28. Now for your Obſervation, that <hi>ſome Books, which were not always known to be Canonical, have been afterwards received for ſuch. But never any Book or Syllable defined for Canonical, was afterwards queſtioned or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected for Apocryphal:</hi> I demand, touching the firſt ſort, Whether they were commended to the Church by the Apoſtles as Canonical, or not? If not, ſeeing the whole Faith was preached by the Apoſtles to the Church, and ſeeing, after the Apoſtles, the Church pretends to no new Revelations, How can it be an Article of Faith to believe them Canonical? And how can you pretend, that your Church, which makes this an Article of Faith, is ſo aſſiſted as not to propoſe any thing as a Divine Truth which is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by God? If they were, How then is the Church an infallible keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Canon of Scripture, which hath ſuffered ſome Books of Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Scripture to be loſt? and others to loſe for a long time their being Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, at leaſt, the neceſſity of being ſo eſteemed, and afterwards, as it were by the law of <hi>Poſtliminium</hi> hath reſtored their Authority and Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calneſs
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64345:80"/>unto them? If this was delivered by the Apoſtles to the Church, the point was ſufficiently diſcuſſed, and therefore your Churche's omiſſion to teach it for ſome Ages, as an Article of Faith, nay degrading it from the number of Articles of Faith, and putting it among diſputable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems, was ſurely not very laudable. If it were not revealed by God to the Apoſtles, and by the Apoſtles to the Church, then can it be no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and therefore her preſumption in propoſing it as ſuch, is inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. And then for the other part of it, <hi>that never any Book or Syllable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined for Canonical, was afterwards queſtioned or rejected for Apocryphal:</hi> Certainly it is a bold Aſſeveration, but extremely falſe. For I demand; The Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom, the Epiſtle of St. James,</hi> and <hi>to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> were they by the Apoſtles approved for Canonical, or no? If not, With what face dare you approve them, and yet pretend that all your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin is Apoſtolical? Eſpecially, ſeeing it is evident that this point is not deducible by rational diſcourſe from any other defined by them. If they were approved by them, this, I hope, was a ſufficient definition: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you were beſt rub your forehead hard, and ſay, that theſe Books were never queſtioned. But if you do ſo, then I ſhall be bold to ask you, what Books you meant in ſaying before, <hi>Some Books which were not always known to be Canonical, have been afterwards received?</hi> Then for the Book of <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees,</hi> I hope, you will ſay it was defined for Canonical before S. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>'s time: and yet he, lib. 19. Moral. c. 13. citing a teſtimony out of it, prefaceth to it after this manner, <hi>Concerning which matter we do not amiſs, if we produce a teſtimony out of Books although not Canonical, yet ſet forth for the edification of the Church. For Eleazar in the Book of Macchabees,</hi> &amp;c. Which, if it be not to reject it from being Canonical, is, without queſtion, at leaſt to queſtion it. Moreover, becauſe you are ſo punctual, as to talk of words and ſyllables, I would know whether before <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> his time, your Church had a defined Canon of Scripture, or not? If not, then was your Church ſurely a moſt Vigilant Keeper of Scripture, that for 1500. years had not defined what was Scripture, and what was not. If it had, then I demand, Was it <hi>that,</hi> ſet forth by <hi>Sixtus?</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> ſet forth by <hi>Clement?</hi> or a <hi>third</hi> different from both? If it were that ſet forth by <hi>Sixtus,</hi> then is it now condemned by <hi>Clement:</hi> if that of <hi>Clement,</hi> it was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned I ſay, but ſure you will ſay contradicted and queſtioned by <hi>Sixtus;</hi> If different from both, then was it queſtioned and condemned by both, and ſtill lies under the condemnation. But then laſtly, Suppoſe it had been true, <hi>That both ſome Book not known to be Canonical had been received,</hi> and that <hi>never any after receiving had been queſtioned:</hi> How had this been a ſign that the Church is infallibly aſſiſted by the Holy Ghoſt? In what mood or figure would this Concluſion follow out of theſe Premiſſes? Certainly, your flying to ſuch poor ſigns as theſe are, is to me a great ſign, that you labour with penury of better Arguments: and that thus to catch at ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and bulruſhes, is a ſhrewd ſign of a ſinking cauſe.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>Ad.</hi> §. 13. We are told here, <hi>That the general promiſes of Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Church, muſt not be reſtrained only to points Fundamental; Becauſe then the Apoſtles words and writings may alſo be ſo reſtrained.</hi> The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment put in form, and made compleat by ſupply of the concealed Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, runs thus;</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="128" facs="tcp:64345:81"/>
The Infallibility promiſed to the preſent Church of any Age, is as abſolute and unlimited, as that promiſed to the Apoſtles in their Preaching and Writings:</p>
                        <p>But the Apoſtles Infallibility is not to be limited to Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals:</p>
                        <p>Therefore neither is the Churche's Infallibility thus to be limited. Or thus;</p>
                        <p>The Apoſtles Infallibility in their Preaching and Writing may be limited to Fundamentals, as well as the Infallibility of the preſent Church: But that is not to be done: Therefore this alſo is not to be done.</p>
                        <p>Now to this Argument, I anſwer, that, if by <hi>may be as well,</hi> in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Propoſition, be underſtood, <hi>may be as poſsibly:</hi> it is true, but imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. If by it we underſtand, <hi>may be as juſtly and rightly,</hi> It is very perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, but very falſe. So that as D. <hi>Potter limits the infallibility of the Preſent Church unto Fundamentals, ſo another may limit the Apoſtles unto them alſo.</hi> He may do it <hi>de facto,</hi> but <hi>de jure</hi> he cannot; that may be done and done law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: this alſo may be done, but not lawfully. That may be done, and, if it be done, cannot be confuted: This alſo may be done, but, if it be done, may eaſily be confuted. It is done to our hand in this very Paragraph, by five words taken out of Scripture, <hi>All Scripture is divinely inſpired.</hi> Shew but as much for the Church: Shew where it is written, <hi>That all the Decrees of the Church are divinely inſpired;</hi> and the Controverſie will be at end. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is not the ſame reaſon for the Churche's abſolute Infallibility, as for the Apoſtles and Scripture's. For, if the Church fall into error, it may be reformed by comparing it with the Rule of the Apoſtles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Scripture. But, if the Apoſtles have erred in delivering the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, to whom ſhall we have recourſe, for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and correcting their error? Again, there is not ſo much ſtrength required in the Edifice as in the Foundation: and, if but wiſe men have the ordering of the building, they will make it much a ſurer thing, that the foundation ſhall not fail the building, than that the building ſhall not fall from the foundation. And though the building be to be of Brick, or Stone, and perhaps of Wood; yet, if it may be poſſibly, they will have a Rock for their Foundation, whoſe ſtability is a much more indubitable thing, than the adherence of the ſtructure to it. Now the Apoſtles, and Prophets, and Canonical Writers, are the Foundation of the Church, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of S. <hi>Paul, Built upon the Foundation of Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;</hi> therefore their ſtability in reaſon ought to be greater then the Churche's, which is built upon them. Again, a dependant Infallibility (eſpecially if the dependance be voluntary) cannot be ſo certain as that on which it depends: But the Infallibility of the Church, depends upon the Infallibility of the Apoſtles, as the ſtraitneſs of the thing regulated, upon the ſtraitneſs of the Rule: and beſides, this dependance is voluntary; for it is in the power of the Church to deviate from this Rule; being nothing elſe but an aggregation of men, of which every one hath free-will, and is ſubject to paſſions and error: Therefore the Churche's Infallibility, is not ſo certain as that of the Apoſtles.</p>
                        <p n="31">31. Laſtly, <hi>Quid verba audiam, cum facta videam?</hi> If you be ſo Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible as the Apoſtles were, ſhew it as the Apoſtles did; <hi>They went forth</hi>
                           <pb n="129" facs="tcp:64345:81"/>(ſaith S. <hi>Mark</hi>) <hi>and preached every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming their words with signs following.</hi> It is impoſſible that God ſhould lye, and that the eternal Truth ſhould ſet his hand and ſeal to the confirmation of a falſhood, or of ſuch Doctrine as is partly true, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe. The Apoſtles Doctrine was thus confirmed, therefore it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely true, and in no part either falſe or uncertain. I ſay, in no part of that which they delivered conſtantly, as a certain divine Truth, and which had the Atteſtation of Divine Miracles. For that the Apoſtles themſelves, even after the ſending of the Holy Ghoſt, were, and, through inadvertence or prejudice, continued for a time in an errour, repugnant to a revealed Truth, it is, as I have already noted, unanſwerably evident, from the <hi>Story of the Acts of the Apoſtles.</hi> For notwithſtanding our Saviour's expreſs Warrant and Injunction, <hi>To go and preach to all Nations,</hi> yet until S. <hi>Peter</hi> was better informed by a Viſion from Heaven, and by the converſion of <hi>Cornelius;</hi> both he and the reſt of the Church, held it unlawful for them, to go or preach the Goſpel to any but the Jews.</p>
                        <p n="32">32. And for thoſe things which they profeſs to deliver as the dictates of humane reaſon and prudence, and not as divine Revelations, why we ſhould take them to be divine Revelations, I ſee no reaſon; nor how we can do ſo, and not contradict the Apoſtles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and God himſelf. Therefore when S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, in the 1. Epiſt to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7.12. <hi>To the reſt ſpeak I, not the Lord;</hi> And again, <hi>Concerning Virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, but I deliver my judgment:</hi> If we will pretend that the Lord did certainly ſpeak, what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake, and that his judgment was God's command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall we not plainly contradict S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and that Spirit by which he wrote? which moved him to write, as in other places, divine Revelations, which he certainly knew to be ſuch; ſo in this place, his own judgment, touching ſome things which God had not particularly revealed unto him. And, if D. <hi>Potter</hi> did ſpeak to this purpoſe <hi>(that the Apoſtles were Infallible only in theſe things which they ſpake, of certain knowledg)</hi> I cannot ſee what danger there were in ſaying ſo. Yet the Truth is, you wrong. D. <hi>Potter.</hi> It is not he, but D. <hi>Stapleton</hi> in him, that ſpeaks the words you cavil at. D. <hi>Stapleton,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>p.</hi> 140. is full and punctual to this purpoſe: then ſets down the effect of his diſcourſe <hi>l.</hi> 8. <hi>Princ. Doct.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 15. and in that, the words you cavil at; and then <hi>p.</hi> 150. he ſhuts up this Paragraph with theſe words, Thus D. <hi>Stapleton.</hi> So that, if either the Doctrine, or the Reaſon, be not good, D. <hi>Stapleton</hi> not D. <hi>Potter</hi> is to anſwer for it.</p>
                        <p n="33">33. Neither do D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s enſuing words <hi>limit the Apoſtle's infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to truths abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation,</hi> if you read them with any can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor: for it is evident, he grants the <hi>Church infallible in Truths abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary;</hi> and as evident, that he <hi>aſcribes to the Apoſtles, the Spirit's gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and conſequently infallibility in a more high and abſolute manner than any ſince them.</hi> From whence, thus I argue: He that grants the Church infallible in Fundamentals, and aſcribes to the Apoſtles the infallible gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Spirit, in a more high and abſolute manner than to any ſince them, limits not the Apoſtles infallibility to Fundamentals; But D. <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> grants to the Church ſuch a limited infallibility, and aſcribes to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>the Spirit's infallible guidance in a more high and abſolute manner;</hi> Therefore he limits not the Apoſtles infallibility to Fundamentals. I once knew a man out of courteſie help a lame dog over a ſtile, and he for requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64345:82"/>bit him by the fingers: Juſt ſo you ſerve D. <hi>Potter.</hi> He out of courteſie grants you, that thoſe words, <hi>The Spirit ſhall lead you into all Truth, and ſhall abide with you ever,</hi> though in their high and moſt abſolute ſenſe they agree only to the Apoſtles, yet in a conditional, limited, moderate, ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary ſenſe, they may be underſtood of the Church. But ſays, that if they be underſtood of the Church, <hi>All, muſt not be ſimply all,</hi> No, nor ſo large an All, as the Apoſtles all, <hi>but all neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> And you, to requite his courteſie in granting you thus much, cavil at him, as if he had preſcribed theſe bounds to the Apoſtles alſo, as well as the preſent Church. Whereas, he hath explained himſelf to the contrary, both in the clauſe fore-mentioned, <hi>The Apoſtles, who had the Spirit's guidance in a more high and abſolute manner than any ſince them;</hi> and in theſe words enſuing, <hi>whereof the Church is ſimply ignorant;</hi> and again, <hi>wherewith the Church is not acquainted.</hi> But moſt clearly in thoſe which being moſt incompatible to the Apoſtles, you with an <hi>&amp;c,</hi> I cannot but fear, craftily have conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>How many obſcure Texts of Scripture which ſhe underſtands not? How many School-Queſtions which ſhe hath not, happily cannot determine? And for matters of fact, it is apparent that the Church may err;</hi> and then concludes, <hi>That we muſt underſtand by All truths, not ſimply All, But</hi> (if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the words as ſpoken of the Church) <hi>All Truth abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> And yet, beyond all this, the negative part of his anſwer agrees very well to the Apoſtles themſelves; for that <hi>All which they were lead in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> was not ſimply All, otherwiſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> erred in ſaying, <hi>we know in part;</hi> but ſuch an All as was requiſite to make them the Churches Foundations. Now ſuch they could not be, without freedom from errour in all thoſe things which they delivered conſtantly, as certain revealed Truths. For, if we once ſuppoſe they may have erred in ſome things of this nature, it will be utterly undiſcernable what they have erred in, and what they have not. Whereas though we ſuppoſe the Church hath erred in ſome things, yet we have means to know, what ſhe hath erred in, and what ſhe hath not. I mean by comparing the Doctrine of the preſent Church, with the Doctrin of the Primitive Church delivered in Scripture. But then, laſt of all, ſuppoſe the <hi>Doctor</hi> had ſaid (which I know he never intended) that this promiſe in this place made to the Apoſtles, was to be underſtood only of Truths abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to ſalvation; Is it conſequent that he makes their Preaching and Writing not infallible in Points not Fundamental? Do you not bluſh for ſhame at this Sophiſtry? The Doctor ſays, no more was promiſed in this place; Therefore he ſays no more was promiſed! Are there not other places beſides this? And may not that be promiſed in other places, which is not promiſed in this?</p>
                        <p n="34">34. <hi>But, if the Apoſtles were Infallible in all things propoſed by them as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truths, the like muſt be affirmed of the Church, becauſe D.</hi> Potter <hi>teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſaid promiſe to be verified in the Church.</hi> True, he doth ſo, but not in ſo abſolute a manner. Now what is oppoſed to Abſolute, but Limited, or reſtrained? To the Apoſtles then it was made, and to them only, yet the words are true of the Church. And this very promiſe might have been made to it, though here it is not. They agree to the Apoſtles <hi>in a higher,</hi> to the Church <hi>in a lower</hi> ſenſe: to the Apoſtles <hi>in a more abſolute,</hi> to the Church <hi>in a more limited</hi> ſenſe. To the Apoſtles <hi>abſolutely</hi> for <hi>the Churches di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:</hi> to the Church <hi>Conditionally by adherence to that direction, and ſo
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64345:82"/>far as ſhe doth adhere to it.</hi> In a word, the Apoſtles were lead into all Truths by the Spirit, <hi>efficaciter:</hi> The Church is led alſo into all Truth by the Apoſtles <hi>writings, ſufficienter.</hi> So that the Apoſtles and the Church, may be fitly compared to the Star and the Wiſemen. The Star was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the finger of God, and could not but go right to the place where Chriſt was: But the Wiſemen were led by the Star to Chriſt; led by it, I ſay, not <hi>efficaciter</hi> or <hi>irreſiſtibiliter,</hi> but <hi>ſufficienter,</hi> ſo that if they would, they might follow it; if they would not, they might chuſe. So was it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Apoſtles writing Scriptures, and the Church. They in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting were infallibly aſſiſted to propoſe nothing as a divine Truth, but what was ſo. The Church is alſo led into all Truth, but it is by the intervening of the Apoſtles writings: But it is as the Wiſemen were led by the Star, or as a Traveller is directed by a Mercurial Statue, or as a Pilot by his Card and Compaſs: led ſufficiently, but not irreſiſtibly: led as that ſhe may follow, not ſo that ſhe muſt. For, ſeeing the Church is a Society of men, whereof every one (according to the Doctrin of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church) hath freewill in believing, it follows, that the whole Aggregate hath freewill in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And if any man ſay that at leaſt <hi>it is morally impoſsible, that of ſo many whereof all may believe aright, not any ſhould do ſo:</hi> I anſwer, It is true, if they did all give themſelves any liberty of judgment. But if all (as the caſe is here) captivate their underſtandings to one of them, all are as likely to err as that one. And he more likely to err than any other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he may err and thinks he cannot, and becauſe he conceives the Spirit abſolutely promiſed to that ſucceſſion of Biſhops, of which many have been notoriouſly and confeſſedly wicked men, <hi>Men of the World:</hi> whereas this Spirit is the <hi>Spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot receive, becauſe he ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him.</hi> Beſides, let us ſuppoſe, that neither in this nor in any other place, God had promiſed any more unto them, but to lead them into all Truth, neceſſary for their own and other mens ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Doth it therefore follow that they were, <hi>de facto,</hi> led no farther? God indeed is obliged by his Veracity to do all that he hath promiſed, but is there any thing that binds him to do no more? May not he be better than his word, but you will quarrel at him? May not his Bounty exceed his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe? And may not we have certainty enough that oft-times it doth ſo? God at firſt did not promiſe to <hi>Solomon,</hi> in his viſion at <hi>Gibeon,</hi> any more than what he askt, which was <hi>wiſdom to govern his people,</hi> and that he gave him. But yet, I hope, you will not deny that we have certainty enough that he gave him ſomething which neither God had promiſed, nor he had ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If you do, you contradict God himſelf: For <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>becauſe thou haſt asked this thing, I have done according to thy word. Lo, I have given thee a Wiſe and an Underſtanding heart, ſo that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee ſhall any ariſe like unto thee. And I have alſo given thee that which thou haſt not asked, both riches, and honour, ſo that there ſhall not be any among the Kings like unto thee in all thy days.</hi> God, for ought appears, never obliged himſelf by promiſe, to ſhew S. <hi>Paul</hi> thoſe <hi>Unſpeakable myſteries,</hi> which in the third Heaven he ſhewed unto him: and yet, I hope, we have certainty enough, that he did ſo. God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to thoſe that <hi>ſeek his Kingdom, and the righteouſneſs thereof, that all things neceſſary ſhall be added unto them,</hi> and in rigour by his promiſe he is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to do no more, and, if he give them neceſſaries he hath diſcharged his
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64345:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>obligation: Shall we therefore be ſo injurious to his bounty towards us, as to ſay it is determined by the narrow bounds of meer Neceſſity? So, though God had obliged himſelf by promiſe to give his Apoſtles infallibility only in things neceſſary to ſalvation; nevertheleſs it is utterly inconſequent, that he gave them no more, than by the rigour of his promiſe he was engaged to do; or that we can have no aſſurance of any farther aſſiſtance that he gave them: eſpecially when he himſelf, both by his word, and by his works, hath aſſured us, that he did aſſiſt them farther. You ſee by this time that your chain of <hi>fearful conſequences</hi> (as you call them) is turned to a rope of ſand, and may eaſily be avoided without any flying to your imaginary infallibility of the Church in all her propoſals.</p>
                        <p n="35">35. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15 <hi>Doubting of a Book received for Canonical,</hi> may ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, either doubting whether it be Canonical; or ſuppoſing it to be Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, whether it be True. If the former ſenſe were yours, I muſt then again diſtinguiſh of the term, <hi>Received;</hi> For it may ſignifie, <hi>either received by ſome particular Church,</hi> or by the <hi>preſent Church Univerſal,</hi> or <hi>the Church of all Ages.</hi> If you meant the word in either of the former ſenſes, that which you ſay is not true. A man may juſtly and reaſonably doubt of ſome Texts, or ſome Book received by ſome particular Church, or by the Univerſal Church of this preſent time, whether it be Canonical or no: and yet have juſt reaſon to believe, and no reaſon to doubt, but that other Books are Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical. As <hi>Euſebius</hi> perhaps had reaſon to doubt of the Epiſtle of S. <hi>James;</hi> the Church <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Hieromes</hi> time, of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> And yet they did not doubt of all the Books of the Canon, nor had reaſon to do ſo. If by <hi>Received,</hi> you mean <hi>Received by the Church of all Ages,</hi> I grant, he that doubts of any one ſuch Book, hath as much reaſon to doubt of all. But yet here again I tell you, that it is poſſible a man may doubt of one ſuch Book, and yet not of all: becauſe it is poſſible men may do not according to reaſon. If you meant your words in the latter ſenſe; then I confeſs, he that believes ſuch a Book to be Canonical, <hi>i. e.</hi> the word of God, and yet (to make an impoſſible Suppoſition) believes it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> not to be true, if he will do according to reaſon, muſt doubt of all the reſt, and believe none. For there being no greater reaſon to believe any thing true, than becauſe God hath ſaid it, nor no other reaſon to believe the Scripture to be true, but only becauſe it is Gods word; he that doubts of the Truth of any thing ſaid by God, hath as much reaſon to believe nothing that he ſayes: and therefore, if he will do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to reaſon, neither muſt nor can believe any thing he ſayes. And upon this ground you conclude rightly, that <hi>the infallibility of true Scripture muſt be Univerſal, and not confined to Points Fundamental.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="36">36. And this Reaſon why we ſhould not refuſe to believe any part of Scripture, upon pretence that the matter of it is not Fundamental, you confeſs to be convincing. <hi>But the ſame reaſon you ſay is as convincing for the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal infallibility of the Church. For</hi> (ſay you) <hi>unleſs She be infallible in all things, we cannot believe her in any one.</hi> But by this reaſon your Proſelytes, knowing you are not infallible in all things, muſt not, nor cannot believe you in any thing. Nay you your ſelf muſt not believe your ſelf in any thing, becauſe you know that you are not infallible in all things. Indeed if you had ſaid <hi>We could not rationally believe her for her own ſake, and upon her own word and authority in any thing,</hi> I ſhould willingly grant the conſequence. For an authority ſubject to errour can be no firm or ſtable foundation of my
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64345:83" rendition="simple:additions"/>belief in any thing: and if it were in any thing, then this authority being one and the ſame in all propoſals, I ſhould have the ſame reaſon to believe all, that I have to believe one: and therefore muſt either do unreaſonably in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving any one thing, upon the ſole warrant of this authority; or unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in not believing all things equally warranted by it. Let this therefore be granted; and what will come of it? <hi>Why then,</hi> you ſay, <hi>we cannot believe her in propounding Canonical Books.</hi> If you mean ſtill (as you muſt do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you play the Sophiſter) <hi>not upon her own Authority,</hi> I grant it: For we believe Canonical Books not upon the <hi>Authority of the preſent Church,</hi> but upon <hi>Univerſal Tradition.</hi> If you mean, <hi>Not at all,</hi> and that with reaſon we cannot believe theſe Books to be Canonical, which the Church propoſes, I deny it. There is no more conſequence in the Argument than in this, The devil is not infallible, therefore if he ſayes there is one God, I cannot believe him. No Geometrician is Infallible in all things, therefore not in theſe things which he demonſtrates. M. <hi>Knot</hi> is not infallible in all things, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he may not believe that he wrote a Book entituled, <hi>Charity Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</hi>

                        <p n="37">37. But <hi>though the Reply be good, Proteſtants cannot make uſe of it, with any good coherence to this diſtinction, and ſome other Doctrins of theirs: becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe they pretend to be able to tell what points are Fundamental and what not; and therefore though they ſhould believe Scripture erroneous in others, yet they might be ſure it erred not in theſe.</hi> To this I anſwer. That if without dependance on Scripture, they did know what were Fundamental, and what not, they might poſſibly believe the Scripture true in Fundamentals, and erroneous in other things. But ſeeing they ground their belief, that <hi>ſuch and ſuch things only are Fundamentals,</hi> only upon <hi>Scripture,</hi> and goe about to prove their aſſertion true, only by Scripture, then muſt they ſuppoſe the Scripture true abſolutely and in all things, or elſe the Scripture could not be a ſufficient warrant to them, to believe this thing, that theſe only Points are Fundament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. For who would not laugh at them if they ſhould argue thus, The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is true in ſomething; the Scripture ſayes that theſe Points only are Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, therefore this is true, that theſe only are ſo! For every Freſh-man in Logick knows, that from meer particulars nothing can be certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. But on the other ſide, this reaſon is firme, and demonſtrative, The Scripture is true in all things; But the Scripture ſayes, that theſe only Points are the Fundamentals of Chriſtian Religion; therefore it is true, that theſe only are ſo. So that the knowledge of Fundamentals being it ſelf drawn from Scripture, is ſo far from warranting us to believe the Scripture is, or may be, in part True, and in part Falſe; that it ſelf can have no foundation, but the Univerſal truth of Scripture. For, to be a Fundamental Truth, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſes to be a Truth; now I cannot know any Doctrin to be a Divine and ſupernatural Truth, or a true part of Chriſtianity, but only becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſayes ſo which is all true: Therefore, much more can I not know it to be a Fundamental Truth.</p>
                        <p n="38">38. <hi>Ad.</hi> §. 16. To this Paragraph I anſwer. Though, the Church being not infallible, I cannot believe her in every thing ſhe ſayes; yet I can and muſt believe her in every thing ſhe proves, either by Scripture, Reaſon, or Univerſal Tradition, be it Fundamental, or be it not Fundamental. This you ſay, we <hi>cannot in Points not Fundamental, becauſe in ſuch we believe ſhe may erre.</hi> But this I know, we can: becauſe though ſhe may erre in ſome things,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:64345:84"/>yet ſhe does not erre in what ſhe proves, though it be not Fundamental. Again you ſay, <hi>We cannot do it in Fundamentals, becauſe we muſt know what Points be Fundamental, before we go to learn of her.</hi> Not ſo. But ſeeing Faith comes by Hearing, and by hearing thoſe who give teſtimony to it which none doth but the Church and the Parts of it; I muſt learn of the Church, or of ſome part of it, or I cannot know any thing Fundamental or not Fundamental. For how can I come to know, that there was ſuch a man as Chriſt, that he taught ſuch Doctrin, that he and his Apoſtles did ſuch Miracles in Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it, that the Scripture of GOD's Word, unleſs I be taught it? So then, the Church is, though <hi>not a certain Foundation and proof of my Faith, yet a neceſſary Introduction to it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="39">39. But the <hi>Churches infallible Direction, extending only to Fundamentals, unleſs I know them before I go to learn of her, I may be rather deluded than inſtructed by her.</hi> The reaſon and connexion of this conſequence, I fear neither I nor you do well underſtand. And beſides, I muſt tell you, you are too bold in taking that which no man grants you, <hi>That the Church is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Director in Fundamentals.</hi> For if ſhe were ſo, then muſt we not only learn Fundamentals of her, but alſo <hi>learn of her what is Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and take all for Fundamental which ſhe delivers to be ſuch.</hi> In the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance whereof, if I knew any one Church to be Infallible, I would quickly be of that Church. But, good Sir, you muſt needs do us this favour, to be ſo acute, as to diſtinguiſh between being <hi>infallible in Fundamentals,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an <hi>infallible Guide in Fundamentals.</hi> That there ſhall be alwaies <hi>a Church infallible in Fundamentals,</hi> we eaſily grant, for it comes to no more but this, <hi>that there ſhall be alwais a Church.</hi> But that there ſhall be alwaies ſuch a Church, which is an infallible Guide in Fundamentals, this we deny. For this cannot be without ſetling a known Infallibility in ſome one known So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Chriſtians, (as the <hi>Greek</hi> or the <hi>Roman,</hi> or ſome other Church) by adhering to which Guide, men might be guided to believe aright in all Fundamentals. A man that were deſtitute of all means of communicating his thoughts to others, might yet, in himſelf, and to himſelf, be infallible; but he could not be a Guide to others. A Man or a Church that were inviſible, ſo that none could know how to repair to it for direction, could not be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Guide, and yet he might be in himſelf infallible. You ſee then, there is a wide difference between theſe two, and therefore I muſt beſeech you not to confound them, nor to take the one for the other.</p>
                        <p n="40">40. But they that <hi>know what Points are Fundamental, otherwiſe than by the Churches Authority, learn not of the Church:</hi> Yes, they may learn of the Church, that the Scripture is the Word of God, and from the Scripture, that ſuch Points are Fundamental, others are not ſo; and conſequently learn, even of the Church, even of your Church, that all is not Fundamental, nay all is not true, which the Church teacheth to be ſo. Neither do I ſee what hinders, but a man may learn of a Church, how to confute the errors of that Church which taught him: as well as of my Maſter in Phyſick, or the Mathematicks, I may learn thoſe rules and principles, by which I may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute my Maſter's erroneous Concluſions.</p>
                        <p n="41">41. But you ask, <hi>If the Church be not an Infallible Teacher, why are we commanded to hear, to ſeek, to obey the Church?</hi> I anſwer. For Commands <hi>to ſeek the Church,</hi> I have not yet met with any; and, I believe, you, if you were to ſhew them, would be your ſelf to ſeek. But yet, if you could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

Whether particular Churches, Governors, Paſtors, Paretns be not to be heard and obeyed? Or whether all theſe be infallible. I wonder you will thruſt upon us ſo often, theſe worn-out Objections, without taking notice of their Anſwers.</p>

Your Argument from S. <hi>Auſtines</hi> firſt place, is a Fallacy, <hi>A dicto ſecundum quid ad dictum ſimpliciter.</hi> If the <hi>whole Church practiſe any of theſe things,</hi> (<hi>matters of order and decency,</hi> for ſuch only there he ſpeaks of,) <hi>to diſpute whether that ought to be done, is inſolent madneſs.</hi> And from hence you inferr, <hi>If the whole Church practiſe any thing, to diſpute whether it ought to be done, is inſolent madneſs.</hi> As if there were no difference between <hi>any thing,</hi> and <hi>any of theſe things?</hi> Or, as if I might not eſteem it pride and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to contradict and diſturb the Church for matter of order, pertaining to the time and place, and other circumſtances, of Gods worſhip; and yet account it neither pride nor folly, to go about to reform ſome errors, which the Church hath ſuffered to come in, and to vitiate the very ſubſtance of Gods worſhip. It was a practice of the whole Church in S. <hi>Auſtines</hi> time, and eſteemed an Apoſtolique Tradition, even by Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf, <hi>That the Euchariſt ſhould be adminiſtred to Infants:</hi> Tell me, Sir, I beſeech you; Had it been inſolent madneſs to diſpute againſt this practice, or had it not? If it had, how inſolent and mad are you, that have not only diſputed againſt it, but utterly aboliſhed it? If it had not, then, as I ſay, you muſt underſtand Saint <hi>Auſtines</hi> words, not ſimply of all things; but (as indeed he himſelf reſtrained them) <hi>of theſe things, of matter of Order, Decency, and Uniformity.</hi>

                        <p n="44">44. But the Doctrines; That <hi>Infants are to be baptized, and, thoſe that are baptized by Heretiques, are not to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Auſtine they are true Doctrines, and we may be certain of them upon the Authority of the Church, which we could not be, unleſs the Church were Infallible; therefore the Church is infallible.</hi> I anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there is no repugnance but we may be certain enough, of the Univerſal Traditions of the ancient Church; ſuch, as in S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> account, theſe were which here are ſpoken of, and yet not be certain enough, of the definitions of the preſent Church. Unleſs you can ſhew (which I am ſure you can never do) that the Infallibility of the preſent Church, was alwaies a Tradition of the Ancient Church. Now your main buſineſs is to prove the preſent Church infallible, not ſo much in conſigning ancient Tradition, as in defining emergent Controverſies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Again, it follows not, becauſe
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:64345:85"/>the Churches Authority is warrant enough for us to believe ſome Doctrin, touching which the Scripture is ſilent; therefore it is Warrant enough to believe theſe, to which the Scripture ſeems repugnant. Now the Doctrines, which S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> received upon the Churches Authority, were of the firſt ſort; the Doctrines for which we deny your Churches Infallibility, are of the ſecond. And therefore though the Churches Authority might be ſtrong enough to bear the weight which S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> laid upon it, yet haply it may not be ſtrong enough, to bear that which you lay upon it. Though it may ſupport ſome Doctrines without Scripture, yet ſurely not againſt it. And laſt of all, to deal ingenuouſly with You and the World, I am not ſuch an Idolater of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> as to think a thing proved ſufficiently becauſe he ſays it, not that all his ſentences are Oracles; and particularly in this thing, that, whatſoever was practiſed or held by the Univerſal Church of his time, muſt needs have come from the Apoſtles. Though, conſidering the neerneſs of his time to the Apoſtles, I think it a good probable way, and therefore am apt enough to follow it, when I ſee no reaſon to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Yet, I profeſs, I muſt have better ſatisfaction, before I can induce my my ſelf to hold it certain and infallible. And this, not becauſe Popery would come in at this door, as ſome have vainly feared, but becauſe by the Church Univerſal of ſome time, and the Church Univerſal of other times, I ſee plain contradictions held and practiſed. Both which could not come from the Apoſtles; for then the Apoſtles had been teachers of falſhood. And therefore the belief or practice of the preſent Univerſal Church, can be no infallible proof, that the Doctrine ſo believed, or the Cuſtom ſo practiſed, came from the Apoſtles. I inſtance in the Doctrine of the <hi>Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,</hi> and the <hi>Euchariſts neceſsity for Infants:</hi> both which Doctrines have been taught by the conſent of the eminent Fathers of ſome Ages, without any oppoſition from any of their Contemporaries: and were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by them, not as Doctors, but as Witneſſes, not as their own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but as Apoſtolike Traditions. And therefore meaſuring the Doctrin of the Church by all the Rules which Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> gives us for that purpoſe, both theſe Doctrins muſt be acknowledged to have been the Doctrins of the ancient Church of ſome Age or Ages; And that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Doctrines were Catholique at ſome other time, I believe you will not think it needful for me to prove. So that either I muſt ſay, the Apoſtles were Fountains of contradictious Doctrines, or that being the Univerſal Doctrin of the preſent Church, is no ſufficient proof that it came originally from the Apoſtles. Beſides, who can warrant us, that the Univerſal Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Church were all Apoſtolical? ſeeing in that famous place for Traditions, in <hi>Tertullian,</hi>

To this Point when you ſpeak, you ſhall have an Anſwer; but hitherto you do but wander.</p>
                        <p n="46">46. But let us ſee what S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſays, <hi>They</hi> (the Apoſtles) <hi>delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not all things in writing,</hi> (who denies it?) <hi>but many things alſo without writing</hi> (who doubts of it?) <hi>and theſe alſo are worthy of belief.</hi> Yes, if we knew what they were. But many things are worthy of belief, which are not neceſſary to be believed: As, that <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was Emperour of <hi>Rome</hi> is a thing worthy of belief, being ſo well teſtified as it is, but yet it is not neceſſary to be believed; a man may be ſaved without it. Thoſe many works which <hi>our Saviour did</hi> (which S. <hi>John</hi> ſuppoſes, <hi>would not have been contained in a world of Books</hi>) if they had been written, or if God by ſome other means had preſerved the knowledge of them, had been as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be believed, and as neceſſary, as thoſe that are written. But to ſhew you how much more a faithful keeper Records are than Report, thoſe few that were written are preſerved &amp; believed; thoſe infinitely more that were not written are all loſt and vaniſhed out of the memory of men. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God in his Providence hath not thought fit to preſerve the memory of them, he hath freed us from the Obligation of believing them: for every Obligation ceaſeth, when it becomes impoſſible. Who can doubt but the Primitive Chriſtians, to whom the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles were written, either of themſelves underſtood, or were inſtructed by the Apoſtles, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſenſe of the obſcure places of them? Theſe Traditive Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, had they been written and diſperſed, as the Scriptures were, had without queſtion been preſerved, as the Scriptures are. But to ſhew how excellent a Keeper of the Tradition, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been, or even the Catholique Church, for want of writing they are all loſt, nay were all loſt, within a few ages after Chriſt. So that if we conſult the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Interpreters, we ſhal hardly find any two of them agree about the ſenſe of any one of them. <hi>Cardinal Perron,</hi> in his Diſcourſe of Traditions, having alledged this place for them, <hi>Hold the Traditions,</hi> &amp;c. tells us, We <hi>muſt not anſwer that S.</hi> Paul <hi>ſpeaks here, only of ſuch Traditions, which (though not in this Epiſt. to the Theſſ. yet) were afterwards written, and in other Books of Scripture: becauſe it is upon occaſion of Tradition</hi> (touching the <hi>cauſe</hi> of the <hi>hinderance of the coming of Antichriſt</hi>) <hi>which was never writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that he lays this injunction upon them, to hold the Traditions.</hi> Well, let us grant this Argument good, and concluding; and that the Church of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> or the Catholique Church (for what S. <hi>Paul</hi> writ to one Church, he writ to all) were to hold ſome unwritten Traditions, and among the reſt, what was the cauſe of the hinderance of the coming of Antichriſt. But what if they did not perform their duty in this point, but ſuffered this Tradition to be loſt out of the memory of the Church? Shal we not conclude, that ſeeing God would not ſuffer any thing neceſſary to Salvation to be loſt, and he hath ſuffered this Tradition to be loſt, therefore the knowledge
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64345:86"/>or belief of it, though it were a profitable thing, yet it was not neceſſary? I hope you will not challenge ſuch Authority over us, as to oblige us to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities, to do that which you cannot do your ſelves. It is therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite that you make this command poſſible to be obeyed, before you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire obedience unto it. Are you able then to inſtruct us ſo well, as to be fit to ſay unto us, <hi>Now ye know what witholdeth?</hi> Or, do you your ſelves know that ye may inſtruct us? Can ye, or dare you ſay, this or this was this hinderance which S. <hi>Paul</hi> here meant, and all men under pain of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation are to believe it? Or if you cannot, (as I am certain you cannot) go then, and vaunt your Church, for the only Watchful, Faithful, Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Keeper of the Apoſtles Traditions; when here this very Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which here in particular was depoſited with the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> and the Primitive Church, you have utterly loſt it, ſo that there is no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep or print of it remaining, which with Divine Faith we may rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Bleſſed therefore be the goodneſs of God, who, ſeeing that what was not written, was in ſuch danger to be loſt, took order, that what was neceſſary ſhould be written! Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s counſel therefore, of <hi>accounting the Churches Traditions worthy of belief,</hi> we are willing to obey: And, if you can of any thing make it appear, that <hi>it is Tradition,</hi> we will ſeek no farther.

You conclude this Paragraph with a ſentence of S. <hi>Auſtins,</hi> who ſays, <hi>The Church doth not approve, nor diſſemble, nor do, theſe things which are againſt Faith or good life:</hi> and from hence you conclude, <hi>That it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath done ſo, nor ever can do ſo.</hi> But though the argument hold in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick <hi>à non poſſe, ad non eſſe,</hi> yet I never heard, that it would hold back, <hi>à non eſſe, ad non poſſe.</hi> The Church cannot do this, therefore it does not, follows with good conſequence: but The Church doth not this, therefore it ſhall never do it, nor can never do it, this, I believe, will hardly follow. In the Epiſtle next before to the ſame <hi>Januarius,</hi> writing of the ſame mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he hath theſe words, <hi>It remains, that the thing you enquire of, muſt be of that third kind of things, which are different in divers places. Let every one therefore do, that which he finds done in the Church to which he comes; for none of them is againſt Faith or good manners.</hi> And why do you not infer from hence, that <hi>no particular Church can bring up any Cuſtom that is againſt Faith or good manners?</hi> Certainly this Conſequence hath as good reaſon for it as the former. If a man ſay of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (what S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> of the Church) that ſhe neither approves, nor diſſembles, nor doth any thing againſt Faith or good manners, would you collect preſently, that this man did either make or think the Church of <hi>England</hi> infallible? Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, it is obſervable out of this, and the former Epiſtle, that this Church, <hi>which did not</hi> (as S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> according to you, thought) <hi>approve or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, or do any thing againſt faith or good life,</hi> did yet tolerate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble vain ſuperſtitions, and humane preſumptions, and ſuffer all places to be full of them, and to be exacted, as, nay more ſeverely than, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God himſelf. This Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf profeſſeth
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64345:86"/>in this very Epiſtle. <hi>This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I do infinitely grieve at, that many moſt wholſom precepts of the divine Scripture, are little regarded; and in the mean time all is ſo full of ſo many preſumptions, that he is more grievouſly found fault with, who during his octaves, toucheth the earth with his naked fooot, then he that ſhall bury his ſoul in drunkenneſs.</hi> Of theſe he ſayes, <hi>That they were neither contained in Scripture, decreed by Councels, nor corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Cuſtom of the Univerſal Church. And though not againſt Faith, yet unprofitable burdens of Chriſtian liberty, which made the condition of the Jews more tolerable then that of Chriſtians.</hi> And therefore he profeſſeth of them, <hi>Approbare non poſſum, I cannot approve them.</hi> And, <hi>Ubi facultas tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buitur, reſecanda exiſtimo; I think they are to be cut off, whereſoever we have power.</hi> Yet ſo deeply were they rooted, and ſpread ſo far, through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet devotion of the people, alwayes more prone to ſuperſtition than true piety, and through the connivence of the Governors, who ſhould have ſtrangled them at their birth, that himſelf, though he grieved at them, and could not allow them, yet for fear of offence he durſt not ſpeak againſt them, <hi>Multa hujuſmodi, propter nonnullarum vel ſanctarum vel turbulenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum perſonarum ſcandala devitanda, liberius improbare non audeo. Many of theſe things for fear of ſcandalizing many holy perſons, or provoking thoſe that are turbulent, I dare not freely diſallow.</hi> Nay, the Catholique Church it ſelf, did ſee and diſſemble, and tolerate them; for theſe are the things of which he preſently ſays after, <hi>The Church of God</hi> (and you will have him ſpeak of the true Catholique Church) <hi>placed between Chaff and Tares, tolerates ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things.</hi> Which was directly againſt the command of the holy Spirit, given the Church by S. <hi>Paul, To ſtand faſt in that liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made her free, and not to ſuffer her ſelf to be brought in bondage to theſe ſervile burdens.</hi> Our Saviour tels the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>That in vain they worſhipped God, teaching for Doctrines mens Commandments: For that laying aſide the Commandments of God, they held the Traditions of men, as the waſhing of pots, and cups, and many other ſuch like things.</hi> Certainly, that which S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> complains of, as the general fault of Chriſtians of his time, was parallel to this: <hi>Multa</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>quae in divinis libris ſaluberri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè praecepta ſunt, minus curantur;</hi> This, I ſuppoſe, I may very well ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in our Saviour's words, <hi>The Commandments of God are laid aſide;</hi> And then, <hi>Tam multis praeſumptionibus ſic pleana ſunt omnia, All things, or all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are ſo full of ſo many preſumptions, and thoſe exacted with ſuch ſeverity, nay with Tyranny, that he was more ſeverly cenſured, who in the time of his Octaves touched the earth with his naked feet, than he which drowned and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his ſoul in drink.</hi> Certainly, if this be not <hi>to teach for Doctrines mens Commandments,</hi> I know not what is. And therefore theſe ſuperſtitious Chriſtians might be ſaid <hi>to worſhip God in vain,</hi> as well as the Scribes and Phariſes. And yet great variety of ſuperſtitions of this kind, were then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpread over the Church, being different in divers places. This is plain from theſe words of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> concerning them, <hi>Diverſorum locorum diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis moribus innumerabiliter variàntur;</hi> and apparent, becauſe the ſtream of them was grown ſo violent, that he durſt not oppoſe it, <hi>Liberiùs improbare non audeo, I dare not freely ſpeak againſt them.</hi> So that to ſay, the Catholique Church tolerated all this, and for fear of offence, durſt not abrogate or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it, is to ſay (if we judge rightly of it) that the Church with ſilence and connivence generally tolerated Chriſtians to <hi>worſhip God in vain.</hi> Now
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64345:87"/>how this tolerating of Univerſal ſuperſtition in the Church, can conſiſt with the aſſiſtance and direction of Gods omnipotent Spirit to guard it from ſuperſtition, and with the accompliſhment of that pretended Prophecy of the Church, <hi>I have ſet Watchmen upon thy walls, O Jeruſalem, which ſhall never hold their peace day nor night;</hi> Beſides, how theſe Superſtitions being thus nouriſhed, cheriſhed, and ſtrengthened by the practice of the moſt, and urged with great violence upon others as the Commandments of God, and but fearfully oppoſed or contradicted by any, might in time take ſuch deep root, and ſpread their branches ſo far, as to paſs for Univerſal Cuſtoms of the Church, he that does not ſee, ſees nothing. Eſpecially, conſidering the catching and contagious nature of this ſin, and how faſt ill weeds ſpread, and how true and experimented that Rule is of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, <hi>Exempla non conſiſtunt ubi incipiunt, ſed quamlibet in tenuem recepta tramitem latiſsimè evagandi ſibi faciunt poteſtatem.</hi> Nay, that ſome ſuch ſuperſtition had not already even in S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time, prevailed ſo far, as to be <hi>Conſuetudine univerſae Eccleſiae roboratum,</hi> Who can doubt that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders, that the practice of <hi>Communicating Infants,</hi> had even then got the credit and authority, not only of an univerſal Cuſtom, but alſo of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolique Tradition.</p>
                        <p n="48">48. But (you will ſay) notwithſtanding all this, S. <hi>Auſtin here warrants us, that the Church can never either approve, or diſſemble, or practiſe any thing againſt Faith or good life, and ſo long you may reſt ſecurely upon it.</hi> Yea, but the ſame S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tels us in the ſame place, <hi>That the Church may tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate humane preſumptions, and vain ſuperſtitions, and thoſe urged more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely than the Commandments of God:</hi> And whether ſuperſtition be a ſin or no, I appeal to our Saviour's words before cited, and to the conſent of your Schoolmen. Beſides, if we conſider it rightly, we ſhall find, that the Church is not truly ſaid only to tolerate theſe things, but rather, that a part, and far the leſſer, tolerated and diſſembled them in ſilence, and a part and a far greater, publiquely avowed and practiſed them, and urged them upon others with great violence, and yet continued ſtill a part of the Church. Now why the whole Church might not continue the Church, and yet do ſo, as well as a part of the Church might continue a part of it, and yet do ſo, I deſire you to inform me.</p>
                        <p n="49">49. But now after all this ado, what if S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays not this which is pretended of the Church, <hi>viz. That ſhe neither approves, nor diſſembles, nor practiſes any thing againſt Faith or good life,</hi> but only of good men in the Church? Certainly, though ſome Copies read as you would have it, yet you ſhould not have diſſembled, that others read the place otherwiſe, <hi>viz. Ecccleſia multa tolerat; &amp; tamen quae ſunt contra Fidem &amp; bonam vitam, nec bonus approbat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Church tolerates many things, and yet what is againſt Faith or good life, a good man will neither approve, nor diſſemble, nor practiſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="50">50. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 17. <hi>That Abraham begat Iſaac,</hi> is a point very far from being Fundamental; and yet, I hope, you will grant, that Proteſtants believing Scripture to be the Word of God, may be certain enough of the truth and certainty of it. For what if they ſay that the Catholique Church, and much more themſelves may poſſibly err in ſome unfundamental points, is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſequent, they can be certain of none ſuch? What if a wiſer man than I may miſtake the ſenſe of ſome obſcure place of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> may I not therefore without any arrogance or inconſequence, conceive my
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64345:87"/>certain that I underſtand him in ſome plain places, which carry their ſenſe before them? And then for Points Fundamental, to what purpoſe do you ſay, <hi>That we muſt firſt know what they be, before we can be aſſured that we cannot err in underſtanding the Scriptures;</hi> when we pretend not at all to any aſſurance that we cannot err, but only to a ſufficient certainty, that we do not err, but rightly underſtand thoſe things that are plain, whether Fundamental or not Fundamental: That <hi>God is, and is a Rewarder of them that ſeek him:</hi> That <hi>there is no ſalvation but by faith in Chriſt:</hi> That by <hi>Repentance from dead works, and Faith in Chriſt, Remiſsion of ſins may be obtained:</hi> That <hi>there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the Body?</hi> Theſe we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive both true, becauſe the Scripture ſays ſo, and Truths Fundamental, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are neceſſary parts of the Goſpel, whereof our Saviour ſays <hi>Qui non crediderit, damnabitur.</hi> All which we either learn from Scripture immediately, or learn of thoſe that learn it of Scripture; ſo that neither Learned nor Unlearned pretend to know theſe things independently of Scripture. And therefore in imputing this to us, you cannot excuſe your ſelf from having done us a palpable injury.</p>
                        <p n="51">51. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 18. And I urge you as mainly as you urge D. <hi>Potter</hi> and other Proteſtants, that you tell us that all the Traditions, and all the Definitions of the Church are Fundamental points, and we cannot wreſt from you <hi>a liſt in particular of all ſuch Traditions and Definitions,</hi> without which, no man can tell whether or no he err in points fundamental, and be capable of Salvation; (For, I hope, erring in our fundamentals is no more excluſive of Salvation than erring in yours.) And, which is moſt lamentable, inſtead of giving us ſuch a Catalogue, you alſo fall to wrangle among your ſelves about the making of it; Some of you, as I have ſaid above, holding ſome things to be <hi>matters of Faith,</hi> which others deny to be ſo.</p>
                        <p n="52">52. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 19. I anſwer, That theſe differences between Proteſtants concerning Errors damnable and not damnable, Truths fundamental and not-fundamental, may be eaſily reconciled. For either the Errour they ſpeak of <hi>may be purely and ſimply involuntary,</hi> or it may be in reſpect of the <hi>cauſe of it voluntary.</hi> If the cauſe of it be ſome voluntary and avoidable fault, the Error is it ſelf ſinful, and conſequently in its own nature dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; As, if by negligence in ſeeking the Truth, by unwillingneſs to find it, by pride, by obſtinacy, by deſiring that Religion ſhould be true which ſutes beſt with my ends, by fear of mens ill opinion, or any other wordly fear, or any other wordly hope, I betray my ſelf to any error contrary to any divine revealed Truth, that Error may be juſtly ſtyled a ſin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of it ſelf to ſuch a one damnable. But if I be guilty of none of theſe faults, but be deſirous to know the Truth, and diligent in ſeeking it, and adviſe not at all with fleſh and blood about the choice of my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but only with God, and that Reaſon that he hath given me, if I be thus qualified, and yet through humane infirmity fall into error, that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror cannot be damnable. Again, the party erring may be conceived either to die with contrition for all his ſins known and unknown, or without it; If he die without it, this errour, in it ſelf damnable, will be likewiſe ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: If he die with contrition (as his error can be no impediment but he may) his errour though in it ſelf damnable, to him, according to your doctrine, will not prove ſo. And therefore ſome of thoſe Authors whom you quote, ſpeaking of Errors whereunto men were betrayed, or
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64345:88"/>wherein they were kept by their Fault, or Vice, or Paſſion, (as for the moſt part men are:) Others ſpeaking of them, as errors ſimply and purely invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, and the effects of humane infirmity: ſome, as they were <hi>retracted by Contrition</hi> (to uſe your own phraſe); others, as they were not; no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel though they have paſt upon them, ſome a heavier, and ſome a milder, ſome an abſolving, and ſome a condemning ſentence. The leaſt of all theſe errours, which here you mention, having malice enough too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mixed with it, to ſink a man deep enough into hell: and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of them all, being according to your Principles, either no fault at all, or very Venial, where there is no malice of the will conjoyned with it. And if it be, yet, as the moſt malignant poyſon will not poyſon him that receives with it a more powerful Antidote: ſo, I am confident, your own Doctrin will force you to confeſs, that whoſoever dies with Faith in Chriſt, and Contrition for all ſins known and unknown (in which heap all his ſinful errors muſt be comprized) can no more be hurt by any the moſt malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and peſtilent error, than S. <hi>Paul</hi> by the Viper which he ſhook off in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire. Now touching the <hi>neceſsity of Repentance from dead works, and Faith in Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God, and Saviour of the World,</hi> they all agree; and therefore you cannot deny, but they agree about all that is ſimply neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. Moreover, though, if they ſhould go about to chuſe out of Scripture all theſe Propoſitions and Doctrines which integrate and make up the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſtian Religion, peradventure there would not be ſo an exact agreement amongſt them, as ſome ſay there was between the 70. Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, in tranſlating the Old Teſtament; yet thus far without controverſie they do all agree, that in the Bible all theſe things are contained, and therefore, that whoſoever doth truly and ſincerely believe the Scripture, muſt of neceſſity, either in <hi>hypotheſi,</hi> or at leaſt in <hi>theſi,</hi> either <hi>formally,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>virtually,</hi> either <hi>explicitely,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>implicitely,</hi> either in <hi>Act,</hi> or at leaſt in <hi>preparation of mind,</hi> believe all things Fundamental: It being not-Fundamental, nor required of Almighty God, to believe the true ſenſe of Scripture in all places, but only that we ſhould endeavour to do ſo, and be prepared in mind to do ſo, whenſoever it ſhall be ſufficiently propounded to us. Suppoſe a man in ſome diſeaſe were preſcribed a medicine conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of twenty ingredients, and he, adviſing with Phyſitians ſhould find them differing in opinion about it, ſome of them telling him, that all the ingredients were abſolutely neceſſary; ſome, that only ſome of them were neceſſary, the reſt only profitable, and requiſite <hi>ad melius eſſe;</hi> laſtly, ſome, that ſome only were neceſſary, ſome profitable, and the reſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, yet not hurtful; yet all with one accord agreeing in this, That <hi>the whole receipt had in it all things neceſſary</hi> for the recovery of his health, and that, if he made uſe of it, he ſhould infallibly find it ſucceſsful: what wiſe man would not think they agreed ſufficiently for his direction to the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his health? Juſt ſo, theſe Proteſtant Doctors, with whoſe diſcords you make ſuch Tragedies, agreeing in <hi>Theſi</hi> thus far, That the <hi>Scripture evidently conteins all things neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> both for matter of Faith, and of Practice, and that whoſoever believes it, and endeavours to find the true ſenſe of it, and to conform his life unto it, ſhall certainly perform all things neceſſary to Salvation, and undoubtedly be ſaved; agreeing, I ſay thus far, What matters it for the direction of men to Salvation, though they differ in opinion, touching what points are abſolutely neceſſary,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64345:88"/>and what not? What Errors abſolutely repugnant to Salvation, and what not? Eſpecially conſidering that although they differ about the Queſtion of the neceſſity of theſe Truths, yet for the moſt part they agree in this, that Truths they are, and profitable at leaſt, though not ſimply neceſſary. And though they differ in the Queſtion, Whether the contrary Errors be deſtructive of Salvation, or no: yet in this they conſent, that Errors they are, and hurtful to Religion, though not deſtructive of Salvation. Now that which God requires of us, is this, That we ſhould believe the Doctrins of the Goſpel to be Truths, not all neceſſary Truths, for all are not ſo; and conſequently; the repugnant Errors to be falſhoods: yet not all ſuch falſhoods, as unavoidably draw with them damnation upon all that hold them; for all do not ſo.</p>
                        <p n="53">53. Yea but <hi>you ſay, It is very requiſite we ſhould agree upon a particular Catalogue of Fundamental points; for without ſuch a Catalogue, no man can be aſſured whether or no, he hath Faith ſufficient to Salvation.</hi> This I utterly deny as a thing evidently falſe, and I wonder you ſhould content your ſelf magiſterially to ſay ſo, without offering any proof of it. I might much more juſtly think it enough barely to deny it, without refutation, but I will not. Thus therefore I argue againſt it.</p>
                        <p>Without being able to make a Catalogue of Fundamentals, I may be aſſured of the Truth of this Aſſertion, if it be true, That <hi>the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture contains all neceſſary points of Faith,</hi> and know that I believe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely all that is expreſt in Scripture, and implicitely all that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them: Now he that believes all this, muſt of neceſſity believe all things neceſſary; Therefore without being able to make a Catalogue of Fundamentals, I may be aſſured that I believe all things neceſſary, and conſequently that my faith is ſufficient.</p>
                        <p>I ſaid, of the truth of this Aſſertion, <hi>if it be true:</hi> Becauſe I will not here enter into the Queſtion of the truth of it, it being ſufficient for my preſent purpoſe, that it may be true, and may be believed without any depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon a Catalogue of Fundamentals. And therefore, if this be all your reaſon, to demand a particular Catalogue of Fundamentals, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think your demand unreaſonable. Eſpecially having your ſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the cauſe of the difficulty of it, and that is, <hi>Becauſe Scripture doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver Divine Truths, but ſeldom qualifies them, or declares whether they be or be not abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation.</hi> Yet not ſo ſeldom, but that out of it I could give you an abſtract of the Eſſential parts of Chriſtianity, if it were neceſſary, but I have ſhewed it not ſo, by confuting your reaſon, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the neceſſity of it, and at this time I have no leiſure to do you courteſies that are ſo troubleſom to my ſelf. Yet thus much I will promiſe, that when you deliver <hi>a particular Catalogue of your Church-Propoſals</hi> with one hand, you ſhall receive a particular Catalogue of what I conceive Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, with the other. For as yet, I ſee no ſuch fair proceeding as you talk of, nor any performance on your own part of that which ſo clamorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly you require on ours. For, as for the Catalogue which here you have given us, in ſaying, <hi>You are obliged under pain of damnation to believe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Catholike viſible Church of Chriſt propoſeth as revealed by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God,</hi> it is like a covey of one Partridge, or a flock of one Sheep, or a Fleet compoſed of one Ship, or an Army of one man. The Author of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity miſtaken, demands a particular Catalogue of Fundamental points;</hi> And
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:64345:89"/>
                           <hi>We</hi> (ſay you) <hi>again and again demand ſuch a Catalogue.</hi> And ſurely, If this one Propoſition, which here you think to ſtop our mouths with, be a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, yet at leaſt ſuch a Catalogue it is not, and therefore as yet you have not performed what you require. For, if to ſet down ſuch a Propoſition, wherein are comprized all points taught by us to be neceſſary to ſalvation, will ſerve you inſtead of a Catalogue, you ſhall have Catalogues enough. As, we are obliged to believe all under pain of damnation which God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to believe. There's one Catalogue. We are obliged under Pain of damnation, to believe all, whereof we may be ſufficiently aſſured, that Chriſt taught it his Apoſtles, his Apoſtles the Church. There's another. We are obliged under pain of damnation to believe Gods Word, and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it to be true. There's a third. If theſe generalities will not ſatisfie you, but you will be importuning us to tell you in particular, what thoſe Doctrins are which Chriſt taught his Apoſtles, and his Apoſtles the Church, what points are contained in Gods Word; Then I beſeech you do us reaſon, and give us a particular and <hi>exact Inventory of all your Church-propoſals, without leaving out, or adding any,</hi> ſuch a one which all the Doctors of your Church will ſubſcribe to, and if you receive not then a Catalogue of Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, I for my part will give you leave to proclaim us Bankrupts.</p>
                        <p n="54">54. Beſides this deceitful generality of your Catalogue (as you call it) another main fault we find with it, that it is extreamly ambiguous; and therefore to draw you out of the Clouds, give me leave to propoſe ſome Queſtions to you concerning it. I would know therefore, whether by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, you mean explicitely or implicitely? If you mean implicitely, I would know, Whether your Churches Infallibility be under pain of damnation to be believed explicitely, or no? Whether any other point or points be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, be under the ſame penalty, to be believed explicitely, or no? and if any, what they be? I would know what you eſteem the Propoſals of the Catholike viſible Church? In particular, whether the Decree of the Pope <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> that is, with an intent to oblige all Chriſtians by it, be a ſufficient and an obliging Propoſal? Whether men without danger of Damnation may examin ſuch a Decree, and, if they think they have juſt cauſe, refuſe to obey it? Whether the Decree of a Councel, without the <hi>Pope's</hi> Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, be ſuch an obliging Propoſal, or no? Whether it be ſo in caſe there be no <hi>Pope,</hi> or in caſe it be doubtful who is <hi>Pope?</hi> Whether the Decree of a general Councel confirmed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> be ſuch a Propoſal, and whether he be an Heretique that thinks otherwiſe? Whether the Decree of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Councel confirmed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> be ſuch a Propoſal? Whether the General uncondemned practice of the Church for ſome Ages be ſuch a ſufficient Propoſition? Whether the conſent of the moſt eminent Fathers of any Age, agreeing in the affirmation of any Doctrin, not contradicted by any of their Contemporaries, be a ſufficient Propoſition? Whether the Fathers teſtifying ſuch or ſuch a Doctrin, or practice to be Tradition, or to be the Doctrin or practice of the Church, be a ſufficient aſſurance that it is ſo? Whether we be bound under pain of damnation, to believe every Text of the vulgar Bible, now authorized by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, to be the true Tranſlation of the Originals of the Prophets, and Evangeliſts, and Apoſtles, without any the leaſt alteration? Whether they that lived when the Bible of <hi>Sixtus</hi> was ſet forth, were bound under pain of damnation to believe the ſame of that? And if not of that, of what Bible they were bound to believe
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:64345:89"/>it? Whether the Catholike viſible Church be alwaies that Society of Chriſtians which adheres to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome?</hi> Whether every Chriſtian, that hath ability and opportunity, be not bound to endevour to know ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely the Propoſals of the Church? Whether Implicite Faith in the Churches Veracity, will not ſave him that actually and explicitely disbelieves ſome Doctrin of the Church, not knowing it to be ſo; and actually believes ſome damnable Hereſie, as that God hath the ſhape of a man? Whether an ignorant man be bound to believe any point to be decreed by the Church, when his Prieſt or ghoſtly Father aſſures him it is ſo? Whether his ghoſtly Father may not erre in telling him ſo, and whether any man can be obliged under pain of damnation, to believe an Errour? Whether he be bound to believe ſuch a thing defined, when a number of Prieſts, perhaps ten or twenty tell him it is ſo? And what aſſurance he can have, that they neither erre, nor deceive him, in this matter? Why Implicite Faith in Chriſt or the Scriptures ſhould not ſuffice for a mans Salvation as well as implicite faith in the Church? Whether when you ſay, <hi>Whatſoever the Church propoſeth,</hi> you mean all that ever ſhe propoſed, or that only which ſhe now propoſeth; and whether ſhe now propoſeth all that ever ſhe did propoſe? Whether all the Books of Canonical Scripture were ſufficiently declared to the Church to be ſo, and propoſed as ſuch by the Apoſtles? And if not, from whom the Church had this Declaration afterward? If ſo, whether all men ever ſince the Apoſtles time, were bound under pain of damnation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Epiſtle of S. <hi>James,</hi> and the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> to be Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical; at leaſt, not to disbelieve it, and believe the contrary? Laſtly, why it is not ſufficient for any mans Salvation to uſe the beſt means he can to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his conſcience, and to follow the direction of it? To all theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands when you have given fair and ingenuous Anſwers, you ſhall hear farther from me.</p>
                        <p n="55">55. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 20. At the firſt entrance into this Paragraph, From our own Doctrin, <hi>That the Church cannot erre in Points neceſſary, it is concluded, if we are wiſe, we muſt forſake it in nothing, leſt we ſhould forſake it in ſomething neceſſary.</hi> To which I anſwer, Firſt, that the ſuppoſition, as you underſtand it, is falſly impoſed upon us, and as we underſtand it will do you no ſervice. For when we ſay, that there ſhall be <hi>a Church alwaies,</hi> ſome where or other, <hi>unerring</hi> in <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> our meaning is but this, that <hi>there ſhall be alwaies a Church,</hi> to the very being whereof it is repugnant that it ſhould erre in Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals; for if it ſhould do ſo, it would want the very Eſſence of a Church, and therefore ceaſe to be a Church. But we never annexed this priviledge <hi>to any one Church of any one Denomination,</hi> as the <hi>Greek</hi> or the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: which if we had done, and ſet up ſome ſetled certain So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of Chriſtians, diſtinguiſhable from all others by adhering to ſuch a Biſhop for our Guide in Fundamentals, then indeed, and then only, might you with ſome colour, though with no certainty, have concluded that we could not, in wiſdome, <hi>forſake this Church in any point, for fear of forſaking it in a neceſſary point.</hi> But now that we ſay not this of any one determinate Church, which alone can perform the office of Guide or Director, but indefinitely of the Church, meaning no more but this, <hi>That there ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in ſome place or other, ſome Church that errs not in Fundamentals;</hi> will you conclude from hence, that we cannot in wiſdome forſake this or that, the <hi>Roman</hi> or the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, for fear of erring in Fundamentals?</p>

56. Yea, but you may ſay, (for I will make the beſt I can of all your Arguments) <hi>That this Church thus unerring in Fundamentals, when</hi> Luther <hi>aroſe, was by our confeſsion the</hi> Roman; <hi>and therefore we ought not in wiſdome to have departed from it in any thing.</hi> I anſwer, Firſt, that we confeſs no ſuch thing, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was then this Church, but only a Part of it, and that the moſt corrupted and moſt incorrigible. Secondly, that if by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to that Church, we could have been thus far ſecured, this Argument had ſome ſhew of reaſon. But ſeeing we are not warranted thus much by any priviledge of that Church, that She cannot erre fundamentally, but only from Scripture, which aſſures us that ſhe doth erre very haynouſly, we collect our hope, that the Truths ſhe retains and the practice of them, may prove an Antidote to her againſt the Errors which ſhe maintains in ſuch Perſons, as in ſimplicity of heart follow this <hi>Abſalom;</hi> we ſhould then do againſt the light of our conſcience, and ſo ſin damnably if we ſhould not abandon the profeſſion of her Errors though not Fundamental. Neither can we thus conclude, We may ſafely hold with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in all her Points, for ſhe cannot erre damnably; For this is falſ, ſhe may, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſhe doth not: But rather thus; Theſe Points of Chriſtianity, which have in them the nature of Antidotes againſt the poyſon of all ſinnes and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though otherwiſe much corrupted, ſtill retains; therefore we hope ſhe errs not Fundamentally, but ſtill remains a Part of the Church. But this can be no warrant to us to think with her in all things: ſeeing the very ſame Scripture which puts us in hope ſhe errs not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, aſſures us that in many things, and thoſe of great moment, ſhe errs very grievouſly. And theſe Errors though to them that believe them, we hope they will not be pernicious, yet the profeſſing of them againſt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, could not but bring to us certain Damnation. <hi>As for the fear of depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from ſome Fundamental truths withall, while we depart from her errors,</hi> Haply it might work upon us, if adhearing to her might ſecure us from it, and if nothing elſe could: But both theſe are falſe. For firſt, adhering to her in all things cannot ſecure us from erring in Fundamentals: Becauſe though <hi>de facto</hi> we hope ſhe doth not erre, yet we know no priviledges ſhe hath but ſhe may erre in them her ſelfe: and therefore we had need have better ſecurity hereof than her bare Authority. Then ſecondly, without depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on her at all, we may be ſecured that we do not erre Fundamentally; I mean by believing all things plainly ſet down in Scripture, wherin all neceſſary, and moſt things profitable, are plainly delivered. Suppoſe I were travelling to <hi>London,</hi> and knew two wayes thither, the one very ſafe and convenient, the other very inconvenient, and dangerous, but yet a way to <hi>London:</hi> and that I overtook a Paſſenger on the way, who himſelf believed, and would fain perſwade me, there was no other way but the worſe, and would perſwade me to accompany him in it, becauſe I confeſſed his way, though very inconvenient, and very dangerous, yet a way; ſo that going that way we might come to our journies end by the conſent of both parties: but he believed my way to be none at all; and therefore I might juſtly fear, leſt out of a deſire of leaving the worſt way, I left the true and the only way: If now I ſhould not be more ſecure upon my own knowledge, than frighted by this fallacy, would you not beg me for a fool? Juſt ſo might you think of us, if we would be frighted out of our own knowledge by this bugbear. For the only and the main reaſon why we believe you not to erre
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:64345:90"/>in Fundamentals, is your holding the <hi>Doctrins of Faith in Chriſt and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:</hi> which knowing we hold as well as you, notwithſtanding our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from you, we muſt needs know that we do not erre in Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals, as well as we know that you in ſome ſort do not erre in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, and therefore cannot poſſibly fear the contrary. Yet let us be more liberal to you, and grant that which can never be proved, that God had ſaid in plain terms, <hi>The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>ſhall never deſtroy the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> but withall had ſaid, <hi>that it might and would lay much hay and ſtubble upon it;</hi> That you ſhould never hold any Errour deſtructive of ſalvation, but yet many that were prejudicial to Edification: I demand, Might we have diſpenſed with our ſelves in the believing and profeſſing theſe Errors in regard of the ſmalneſs of them? Or, had it not been a damnable ſin to do ſo, though the Errors in themſelves were not damnable? Had we not had as plain direction to depart from you in ſome things profitable, as to adhere to you in things neceſſary? In the beginning of your Book, when it was for your purpoſe to have it ſo, the greatneſs or ſmalneſs of the matter was not conſiderable, the Evidence of the Revelation was all in all. But here we muſt erre with you in ſmall things, for fear of loſing your direction in greater: and for fear of departing too far from you, not go from you at all, even where we ſee plainly that you have departed from the Truth.</p>
                        <p n="57">57. Beyond all this, I ſay, that this which you ſay <hi>in wiſdom we are to do,</hi> is not only unlawful, but if we will proceed according to reaſon, impoſſible. I mean to adhere to you in all things, having no other ground for it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are (as we will now ſuppoſe) infallible in ſome things, that is, in Fundamentals. For whether by ſkill in Architecture a large ſtructure may be ſupported by a narrow foundation, I know not; but ſure I am, in reaſon no Concluſion can be larger than the Principles on which it is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And therefore if I conſider what I do, and be perſwaded that your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility is but limited, and particular, and partiall, my adherence upon this ground cannot poſſibly be abſolute, and Univerſal, and Total. I am confident, that ſhould I meet with ſuch a man amongſt you (as I am well aſſured there be many) that would grant your Church infallible only in Fundamentals, which what they are he knows not, and therefore upon this only reaſon adheres to you in all things; I ſay that I am confident, that it may be demonſtrated, that ſuch a man adheres to you, with a fiducial and certain aſſent in nothing. To make this clear (becauſe at the firſt hearing it may ſeem ſtrange) give me leave, good Sir, to ſuppoſe you the man, and to propoſe to you a few queſtions, and to give for you ſuch anſwers to them, as upon this ground you muſt of neceſſity give, were you preſent with me. Firſt, ſuppoſing you hold your Church infallible in Fundamentals, obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to errour in other things, and that you know not what Points are Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, I demand, C. Why do you believe the Doctrin of Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation? K. Becauſe the Church hath taught it, which is infallible. C. What? Infallible in all things, or only in Fundamentals? K. In Fundamentals only. C. Then in other pointsſhe may erre? K. She may. C. And do you know what Points are Fundamental, what not? K. No, and therefore I believe her in all things, leſt I ſhould disbelieve her in Fundamentals. C. How know you then, whether this be a Fundamental Point or no? K. I know not. C. It may be then (for ought you know) an unfundamental Point? K. Yes, it may be ſo. C. And in theſe, you ſaid, the Church may err? K. Yes, I did
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64345:91"/>ſo. C. Then poſſibly it may erre in this? K. It may do ſo. C. Then what certainty have you that it does not erre in it? K. None at all, but upon this ſuppoſition, that this is a Fundamental. C. And this ſuppoſition you are uncertain of? K. Yes, I told you ſo before. C. And therefore you can have no certainty of that which depends upon this uncertainty, ſaving only a ſuppoſitive certainty, if it be a Fundamental truth; which is in plain Engliſh to ſay, you are certain it is true, if it be both true and neceſſary. Verily Sir, if you have no better Faith than this, you are no Catholique. K. Good words I pray! I am ſo, and God willing will be ſo. C. You mean in outward profeſſion and practiſe, but in belief you are not, no more than a Proteſtant is a Catholique. For every Proteſtant yeelds ſuch a kinde of aſſent to all the propoſals of the Church, for ſurely they believe them true, if they be Fundamental truths. And therefore you muſt either believe the Church Infallible in all her propoſals, be they foundations, or be they ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructions; or you muſt believe all Fundamental which ſhe propoſes, or elſe you are no Catholique. K. But I have been taught, that <hi>ſeeing I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Church infallible in points neceſſary, in wiſdom I was to believe her in every thing.</hi> C. That was a pretty plauſible inducement, to bring you hither; but now you are here, you muſt go farther, and believe her infallible in all things, or elſe you were as good go back again, which will be a great diſparagement to you, and draw upon you both the bitter and implacable hatred of our Part, and even, with your own, the imputation of raſhneſs and levity. You ſee, I hope by this time, that though a man did believe your Church infallible in Fundamentals, yet he hath no reaſon to do you the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie of believing all her Propoſals; nay, if he be ignorant what theſe Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals are, he hath no certain ground to believe her, upon her Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in any thing. And whereas you ſay, it can be no imprudence, to erre with the Church; I ſay, it may be very great imprudence, if the queſtion be, Whether we ſhould erre with the preſent Church, or hold true with God Almighty.</p>

I have told you already, that this is falſly to ſuppoſe, that we grant that in ſome certain points, ſome certain Church is infallibly aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and under pain of damnation to be obeyed: whereas all that we ſay is this, that in ſome place or other, ſome Church there ſhall be, which ſhall retain all neceſſary Truths. Yet if your ſuppoſition were true, I would not grant your Concluſion, but with this Exception, unleſs the matter were paſt ſuſpition, and apparently certain, that in theſe things I cannot believe God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For then I hope you will grant, that be the thing of never ſo little moment, were it, for inſtance, but that S. <hi>Paul left his cloak at Troas,</hi> yet I were not to gratifie the Church ſo far, as for her ſake to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe what God himſelf hath revealed.</p>
                        <p n="59">59 Whereas you ſay, <hi>Since we are undoubtedly obliged to believe her in Fundamentals, and cannot know preciſely, what thoſe Fundamentals be, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without hazard of our ſouls leave her in any Point;</hi> I anſwer, Firſt, that this argument proceeds upon the ſame falſe ground with the former. And then, that I have told you formerly, that you feare where no fear is; And though we know not preciſely, juſt how much is Fundamental, yet we know, that the Scripture containes all Fundamentals, and more too; and therefore
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:64345:91"/>that in believing that, we believe all Fundamentals and more too. And conſequently, in departing from you, can be in no danger of departing from that which may prove a Fundamental Truth: For we are wel aſſured that certain Errors can never prove Fundamental Truths.</p>
                        <p n="60">60. Whereas you adde, That <hi>that viſible Church which cannot err in Fundamentals, propounds all her definitions without diſtinction to be believed under Anathema's:</hi> Anſw. Again you beg the queſtion, ſuppoſing untruly, that there is any <hi>that viſible Church.</hi> I mean any Viſible Church of one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, which cannot erre in Points Fundamental. Secondly, propoſing definitions to be believed under Anathema's, is no good Argument, that the Propounders conceive themſelves infallible; but only that they conceive the Doctrin they condemn is evidently damnable. A p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ain proof hereof is this, that particular Councils, nay, particular Men, have been very liberal of their Anathema's, which yet were never conceived infallible, either by others or themſelves. If any man ſhould now deny Chriſt to be the Saviour of the world, or deny the Reſurrection, I ſhould make no great ſcruple of Anathematizing his doctrin, and yet am very far from dreaming of infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility.</p>
                        <p n="61">61. And for the <hi>Viſible Churches holding it a Point neceſſary to Salvation, that we believe ſhe cannot erre,</hi> I know no ſuch tenet; unleſs by the Church, you mean the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which you have as much reaſon to do, as that petty King in <hi>Africk</hi> hath, to think himſelf King of all the world. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your telling us, <hi>If ſhe ſpeak true, what danger is it, not to believe her? and if falſe, that it is not dangerous to believe her,</hi> is ſomewhat like your Pope's ſetting your Lawyers to diſpute whether <hi>Conſtantine's Donation</hi> were valid or no; whereas the matter of fact was the far greater queſtion, whether there were any ſuch Donation, or rather when without queſtion there was none ſuch. That you may not ſeem to delude us in like maner, make it appear that the viſible Church doth hold ſo as you pretend: and then whether it be true or falſe, we will conſider afterwards. But for the preſent, with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Tenet of the viſible Church, we will trouble our ſelves no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p n="62">62. The effect of the next Argument is this, <hi>I cannot without grievous ſin diſobey the Church, unleſs I know ſhe commands thoſe things which are not in her power to command: and how far this power extends, none can better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me then the Church. Therefore I am to obey, ſo far as the Church requires my obedience.</hi> I anſwer: Firſt, that neither hath the Catholique Church, but only a corrupt part of it, declared her ſelf, nor required our obedience, in the Points conteſted among us. This therefore is falſly, and vainly ſuppoſed here by you, being one of the greateſt Queſtions amongſt us. Then ſecondly, that God can better inform us, what are the limits of the Churches power, than the Church her ſelf, that is, than the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, who being men ſubject to the ſame paſſions with other men, why they ſhould be thought the beſt Iudges in their owne cauſe, I do not well underſtand! But yet we oppoſe againſt them, no humane deciſive Judges, not any Sect or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but only God and his Word. And therefore it is in vain to ſay, That <hi>in following her, you ſhall be ſooner excuſed, than in following any Sect or Man applying Scriptures againſt her Doctrin:</hi> In as much as we never went about to arrogate to our ſelves that Infallibility or abſolute Authority, which we take away from you. But if you would have ſpoken to the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64345:92"/>purpoſe, you ſhould have ſaid, that in following her you ſhould ſooner have been excuſed, then in cleaving to the Scripture, and to God himſelf.</p>
                        <p n="63">63 Whereas you ſay, <hi>The fearful examples of innumerable perſons, who forſaking the Church, upon pretence of her errours, have failed even in Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Points, ought to deterr all Chriſtians from oppoſing her in any one Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin or practiſe;</hi> This is, juſt as if you ſhould ſay, Divers men have fallen into Scylla, with going too far from Charybdis; be ſure therefore ye keep cloſe to Charybdis: Divers leaving Prodigality, have fallen into covertouſneſs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be you conſtant to Prodigality: Many have fallen from worſhipping God perverſly and fooliſhly, not to worſhip him at all; from worſhipping many gods, to worſhip none; this therefore ought to deterr men from lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Superſtition or Idolatry, for fear of falling into Atheiſm and Impiety. This is your counſel and Sophiſtry: but God ſayes clean contrary; <hi>Take heed you ſwerve not, either to the right hand or to the left: you muſt not do evill that good may come thereon;</hi> therefore neither, that you may avoid a greater evill, you muſt not be obſtinate in a certain error, for fear of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. What if ſome, forſaking the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> have forſaken Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental truths? Was this becauſe they forſooke the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> No ſure, this is <hi>non cauſa pro cauſa:</hi> for elſe all that have forſaken that Church ſhould have done ſo, which we ſay they have not. But becauſe they went too far from her, the golden mean, the narrow way, is hard to be found; and hard to be kept; hard, but not impoſſible: hard, but yet you muſt not pleaſe your ſelf out of it, though you erre on the right hand, though you offend on the milder part, for this is the only way that leads to life, and few there be that find it. It is true, if we ſaid there were no danger in being of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and there were danger in leaving it, it were madneſs to perſwade any man to leave it. But we proteſt and proclaim the contrary, and that we have very little hope of their Salvation, who either out of negligence in ſeeking the truth, or unwillingneſs to find it, live and die in the errors and impieties of that Church: and therefore cannot but conceive thoſe fears to be moſt fooliſh, and ridiculous, which perſwade men to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in one way to hell, leſt haply, if they leave it, they ſhould fall into another.</p>
                        <p n="64">64. But, <hi>Not only others, but even Proteſtants themſelves, wheſe example ought moſt to move us, pretending to reform the Church, are come to affirm that ſhe periſhed for many ages: which D.</hi> Potter <hi>cannot deny to be a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental errour, againſt the Article of the Creed, I believe the Catholique Church, ſeeing be affirms,</hi> Donatiſts <hi>erred Fundamentally in confining it to Africa.</hi> To this I anſwer, Firſt, that the error of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> was not, that they held it poſſible that ſome, or many, or moſt, parts of Chriſtendome, might fall away from Chriſtianity, and that the Church may loſe much of her amplitude, and be contracted to a narrow compaſs in compariſon of her former extent: which is proved not only poſſible, but certain, by irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable experience. For who knows not that Gentiliſm, and Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, mans wickedneſs deſerving it, and Gods providence permitting it, have prevailed, to the utter extirpation of Chriſtianity, upon far the greater part of the world? And S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> when he was out of the heat of Diſputation, confeſſes the Militant Church to be <hi>like the Moon,</hi> ſometimes increaſing, and ſometimes decreaſing. This therefore was no errour in the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64345:92"/>
                           <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> that they held it poſſible, that the Church, from a large extent, might be contracted to a leſſer: nor that they held it poſſible to be reduced to <hi>Africa;</hi> (For why not to <hi>Africk</hi> then, as well as within theſe few Ages, you pretend it was to <hi>Europe?</hi>) But their error was, that they held <hi>de facto,</hi> this was done when they had no juſt ground or reaſon to do ſo: and ſo, upon a vain pretence which they could not juſtifie, ſeparated themſelves from the communion of all other parts of the Church: and that they required it as a neceſſary condition to make a man a member of the Church, that he ſhould be of their communion, and divide himſelf from all other Communions from which they were divided: which was a condition both unneceſſary and unlawful to be required, and therefore the exacting of it was directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the Churches Catholiciſm; in the very ſame nature with their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors who required Circumciſion, and the keeping of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as neceſſary to ſalvation. For whoſoever requires harder or heavyer conditions of men, than God requires of them, he it is that is properly an Enemy of the Churches Univerſality, by hindering either Men or Countries from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning themſelves to it; which, were it not for theſe unneceſſary and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unlawful conditions, in probability would have made them members of it. And ſeeing the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> perſwades men they were as good (for any hope of ſalvation they have) not be Chriſtians, as not be <hi>Romane</hi> Catholiques; believe nothing at all, as not believe all which ſhe impoſes upon them; be abſolutely out of the Churches Communion, as be out of her Communion, or be in any other, Whether ſhe be not guilty of the ſame crime, with the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and thoſe Zelots of the Moſaical Law, I leave it to the judgement of thoſe that underſtand reaſon! This is ſufficient to ſhew the vanity of this Argument. But I adde moreover, that you neither have named thoſe Proteſtants who held the Church to have periſhed for many Ages, who perhaps held not the deſtruction but the corruption of the Church; not that the true Church, but that the pure Church periſhed: or rather that the Church periſhed not from its life and exiſtence, but from its purity and integrity, or perhaps from its ſplendor and viſibility: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have you proved by any one reaſon, but only affirmed it, to be a Fundamental Error, to hold that the Church militant may poſſibly be driven out of the world, and aboliſhed for a time from the face of the earth.</p>
                        <p n="65">65. <hi>But to accuſe the Church of any Error in Faith, is to ſay, ſhe loſt all Faith: For this is the Doctrin of Catholique Divines, that one Errour in Faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes Faith.</hi> To which I anſwer, that to accuſe the Church of ſome Error in Faith, is not to ſay, ſhe loſt all Faith: For this is not the Doctrin of all Catholique Divines; But that he which is an Heretique in one Article, may have true Faith of other Articles. And the contrary is only ſaid and not ſhewed in <hi>Charity Miſtaken.</hi>

That <hi>there can be no juſt cauſe to depart from the whole Church of Chriſt, no more than from Chriſt himſelf;</hi> So p. 76. he tels you, That <hi>whoſoever forſakes any one true member of this body, forſakes the whole.</hi> So that what he ſayes of the one, he ſayes of the other; and tels you, that neither Univerſal nor particular Church, ſo long as they continue ſo, may be forſaken; he means, <hi>Abſolutely,</hi> no more than Chriſt himſelf may be forſaken abſolutely: For the Church is the body of Chriſt, and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever forſakes either the body, or his coherence to any one part of it, muſt forſake his ſubordination, and relation to the Head. Therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever forſakes the Church, or any Chriſtian, muſt forſake Chriſt himſelf.</p>
                        <p n="67">67. But then he tels you plainly in the ſame place, <hi>That it may be lawful and neceſſary to depart from a Particular Church in ſome Doctrins and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi> And this he would have ſaid even of the Catholike Church, if there had been occaſion, but there was none. For there he was to declare and juſtifie our departure, not from the Catholike Church, but the <hi>Roman;</hi> which we maintain to be a particular Church. But in other places, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs his Doctrin to be, that even the Catholique Church may erre in points not Fundamental; which you do not pretend that he ever imputed to Chriſt himſelf. And therefore you cannot with any candor interpret his words, as if he had ſaid, We may not forſake the Church in any thing, no more than Chriſt himſelf: but only thus, We may not ceaſe to be of the Church, nor forſake it abſolutely and totally, no more than Chriſt himſelf. And thus we ſee ſometimes, A mountain may travel, and the production may be a mouſe.</p>
                        <p n="68">68. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 22. But D. <hi>Potter either contradicts himſelf, or elſe muſt grant the Church infallible; Becauſe, he ſaies, if we did not differ from the</hi> Roman, <hi>we could not agree with the Catholique: which ſaying ſuppoſes, the Catholique Church cannot erre.</hi> Anſwer. This Argument, to give it the right name, is an obſcure and intricate Nothing. And to make it appear ſo, let us ſuppoſe, in contradiction to your ſuppoſition, either that the Catholique Church may erre, but doth not, but that the <hi>Roman</hi> actually doth: or, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church doth erre in ſome few things, but that the <hi>Roman</hi> erres in many more. And is it not apparent in both theſe caſes, (which yet both ſuppoſe the Churches Fallibility) a man may truly ſay, Unleſs I diſſent in ſome opinions from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, I cannot agree with the Catholique? Either therefore you muſt retract you imputation laid upon D. <hi>Potter,</hi> or do that which you condemn in him, and be driven to ſay, that the ſame man may hold ſome errors with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and at the ſame time with the Catholique Church not to hold but condemn them. For otherwiſe, in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe caſes is it poſſible for the ſame man, at the ſame time, to agree both with the <hi>Roman</hi> and the Catholique.</p>
                        <p n="69">69. In all theſe Texts of Scripture, which are here alleaged in this laſt Section of this Chapter, or in any one of them, or in any other, Doth God ſay
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64345:93"/>clearly and plainly, <hi>The Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and that Society of Chriſtians which adheres to him, ſhall be ever the infallible guide of Faith?</hi> You will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I preſume, he doth not; and will pretend, it was not neceſſary. Yet if the King ſhould tell us, the Lord Keeper ſhould judge ſuch and ſuch cauſes; but ſhould either not tell us at all, or tell us but doubtfully, who ſhould be Lord-Keeper, ſhould we be any thing the nearer for him to an end of contentions? Nay rather, would not the diſſentions about the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who it is, increaſe contentions, rather than end them? Juſt ſo it would have been, if God had appointed a Church to be Judge of Controverſies, and had not told us which was that Church. Seeing therefore God doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in vain, and ſeeing it had been in vain, to appoint a Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, and not to tell us plainly who it is; and ſeeing laſtly he hath not told us plainly, no not at all who it is; Is it not evident he hath appointed none? Obj. <hi>But</hi> (you will ſay perhaps) <hi>if it be granted once, that ſome Church of one denomination, is the infallible Guide of Faith, it will be no difficult thing to prove, that yours is the Church, ſeeing no other Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be ſo.</hi> Anſw. Yes, the Primitive and the Apoſtolique Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be ſo. That aſſures us, that the <hi>Spirit was promiſed, and given to them, to lead them into all ſaving truth,</hi> that they might lead others. Obj. <hi>But that Church is not now in the world, and how then can it pretend to be the Guide of Faith?</hi> Anſw. It is now in the world ſufficiently to be our Guide; not by the Perſons of thoſe men that were Members of it, but by their Writings, which do plainly teach us, what truth they were led into, and ſo lead us into the ſame truth. Object. <hi>But theſe writings, were the writings of ſome particular men; and not of the Church of thoſe times: how then doth that Church guide us by theſe writings? Now theſe places ſhew that a Church is to be our Guide, therefore they cannot be ſo avoided.</hi> Anſw. If you regard the conception and production of theſe writings, they were the writings of particular men: But if you regard the Reception and Approbation of them, they may be well called the writings of the Church, as having the atteſtation of the Church, to have been written by thoſe that were inſpired and directed by God. As a Statute, though penned by ſome one man, yet being ratified by the Parliament, is called the Act, not of that man, but of the Parliament. Object. But the <hi>words ſeem clearly enough to prove, that the Church, the Preſent Church of every Age, is Univerſally Infallable.</hi> Anſ. For my part, I know I am as willing and deſirous, that the Biſhop or Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be infallible, (provided I might know it) as they are to be ſo eſteemed. But he that would not be deceived muſt take heed, that he take not his deſire that a thing ſhould be ſo, for a reaſon that it is ſo. For, if you look upon Scripture, through ſuch ſpectacles as theſe, they will appear to you, of what colour pleaſes your fancies beſt: and will ſeem to ſay, not what they do ſay, but what you would have them. As ſome ſay, the <hi>Manna,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were fed in the Wilderneſs, had in every mans mouth, that very taſt which was moſt agreeable to his palate. For my part I profeſs, I have conſidered them a thouſand times, and have looked upon them (as they ſay) on both ſides, and yet to me they ſeem to ſay no ſuch matter.</p>
                        <p n="70">70. Not the firſt. For the <hi>Church may err, and yet the gates of hell not prevail againſt her.</hi> It may err, and yet continue ſtill a true Church, and bring forth Children unto God, and ſend ſouls to Heaven. And therefore
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64345:94"/>this can do you no ſervice, without the plain begging of the point in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> That every error is one of the gates of Hell. Which we abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely deny, and therefore, you are not to ſuppoſe, but to prove it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is our denial without reaſon. For ſeeing you do, and muſt grant, that a particular Church, may hold ſome error, and yet be ſtill a true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church: Why may not the Univerſal Church hold the ſame error, and yet remain the true Univerſal?</p>
                        <p n="71">71. Not the Second or Third. For, <hi>the Spirit of Truth, may be with a Man, or a Church for ever, and teach him all Truth:</hi> And yet he may fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome error, if this <hi>all,</hi> be not <hi>ſimply all,</hi> but all of ſome kind: which you confeſs to be ſo unqueſtioned and certain, that you are offended with D. <hi>Potter,</hi> for offering to prove it. Secondly, he may fall into ſome error, even contrary to the truth which is taught him, if it be taught him <hi>only ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not irreſiſtibly,</hi> ſo that he may learn it if he will, not ſo that he muſt and ſhall whether he will or no. Now, who can aſcertain me, that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's teaching is not of this nature; or, how can you poſſibly reconcile it, with your Doctrin of Freewill in believing, if it be not of this nature? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the word in the Original is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, which ſignifies, to be a guide and directer only, not to compel or neceſſitate. Who knows not, that a Guide may ſet you in the right way, and you may either negligently miſtake, or willingly leave it? And to what purpoſe doth God complain ſo often, and ſo earneſtly of ſome, that <hi>had eyes to ſee and would not ſee, that ſtopped their ears, and cloſed their eyes, leſt they ſhould hear and ſee?</hi> Of others <hi>that would not underſtand, leſt they ſhould do good: That the light ſhined, and the darkneſs comprehended it not: That he came unto his own, and his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him not: That light came into the world, and men loved darkneſs more than light? To what purpoſe ſhould he wonder, ſo few believed his report, and that to ſo few his Arm was revealed: And that when he comes, he ſhould no find no Faith upon Earth, if his outward teaching were not of this nature,</hi> that it might be followed, and might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted. And if it be, then God may teach, and the Church not learn: God may lead, and the Church be refractory and not follow. And indeed, who can doubt, that hath not his eyes vailed with prejudice, that God hath taught the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> plain enough in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that <hi>all things in the Church are to be done for edification;</hi> and that in any publique Prayers, or Thanks-givings, or Hymns, or Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Inſtruction, to <hi>uſe a language,</hi> which the aſſiſtants <hi>gen<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>rally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not,</hi> is not for edification? Though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will not learn this, for fear of confeſſing an error, and ſo overthrowing her Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; yet the time will come, when it ſhall appear, that not only by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, they were taught this ſufficiently, and commanded to believe it, but by reaſon and common ſenſe. And ſo for the Communion in both kinds, who can deny but they are taught it by our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. in theſe words, according to moſt of your own expoſitions, <hi>Unleſs you eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, you have no life in you.</hi> (If our Saviour ſpeak there, of the Sacrament, as to them he doth, becauſe they conceive he doth ſo.) For though they may pretend, that receiving in one kind, they receive the blood together with the body, yet they can with no face pretend that they drink it: And ſo obey not our Saviour's injunction ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the letter, which yet they <hi>profeſs, is literally alwayes to be obeyed,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64345:94"/>unleſs ſome impiety, or ſome abſurdity force us to the contrary:</hi> and they are not yet arrived to that impudence, to pretend, that either there is impiety or abſurdity in receiving the Communion in both kinds. This therefore, they, if not others, are plainly taught by our Saviour in this place: But by S. <hi>Paul</hi> all without exception, when he ſays; <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of this bread, and drink of this Chalice.</hi> This <hi>(a Man)</hi> that is to examine himſelf, is <hi>every man,</hi> that can do it: as is confeſſed on all hands. And therefore it is all one, as if he had ſaid, <hi>Let every man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of this bread and drink of this cup.</hi> They which acknowledge S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, and S. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, to be the Word of God, one would think ſhould not deny, but that they are taught theſe two Doctrines plain enough. Yet we ſee they neither do, nor will learn them. I conclude therefore, that the Spirit may very well teach the Church, and yet the Church fall into and continue in Error, by not regarding what ſhe is taught by the Spirit.</p>
                        <p n="72">72. But all this I have ſpoken upon a ſuppoſition only, and ſhewed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that though theſe Promiſes had been made unto the preſent Church of every Age (I might have ſaid though they had been to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by name) yet no certainty of her Univerſal Infallibility could be built upon them. But the plain truth is, that theſe Promiſes are vainly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated by you, and were never made to you, but to the Apoſtles only. I pray deal ingenuouſly, and tell me, Who were they of whom our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſays, <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you being preſent with you,</hi> c. 14.25. <hi>But the Comforter ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatſoever I have told you,</hi> v. 26? Who are they to whom he ſayes, <hi>I go away and come again unto you;</hi> And <hi>I have told you before it come to paſs,</hi> v. 28, 29. <hi>You have been with me from the beginning,</hi> c. 15. v. 27? And again; <hi>Theſe things I have told you, that when the time ſhall come you may remember that I told you of them: and theſe things I ſaid not to you at the beginning, becauſe I was with you,</hi> c. 16. v. 4. And, <hi>Becauſe I ſaid theſe things unto you, ſorrow hath filled your hearts,</hi> v. 6. Laſtly, Who are they of whom he ſaith, v. 12. <hi>I have yet many things to ſay unto you, but ye cannot bear them now?</hi> Do not all theſe circumſtances appropriate this whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of our Saviour to his Diſciples, that were then with him, and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, reſtrain the Promiſes of the Spirit of Truth, which was <hi>to lead them into all truth,</hi> to their Perſons only? And ſeeing it is ſo, is it not an impertinent arrogance and preſumption, for you to lay claim unto them, in the behalf of your Church? Had Chriſt been preſent with your Church? Did the Comforter bring theſe things to the Remembrance of your Church, which Chriſt had before taught, and ſhe had forgotten? Was Chriſt then departing from your Church? And did he tell of his departure before it came to paſs? Was your Church with him from the beginning? Was your Church filled with ſorrow, upon the mentioning of Chriſt's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture? Or laſtly, Did he, or could he have ſaid to your Church, which then was not extant, <hi>I have yet many things to ſay unto you, but ye cannot bear them now?</hi> as he ſpeaks in the 13 v. immediately before the words by you quoted. And then goes on, <hi>Howbeit when the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth.</hi> Is it not the ſame <hi>You</hi> he ſpeaks to in the 13. v. and that he ſpeaks to in the 14? And is it not apparent to any one that hath but half an eye, that in the 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſpeaks only to them that then
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64345:95"/>were with him? Beſides, in the very Text by you alledged, there are things promiſed, which your Church cannot with any modeſty pretend to. For there it is ſaid, <hi>The Spirit of Truth</hi> not only <hi>will guide you into all Truth,</hi> but alſo <hi>will ſhew you things to come.</hi> Now your Church (for ought I could ever underſtand) doth not ſo much as pretend to the ſpirit of Prophecy, and knowledge of future events: And therefore hath as little cauſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the former promiſe of being <hi>led by the Spirit into all Truth.</hi> And this is the Reaſon, why both You in this place, and generally, your Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Controverſies, when they entreat of this Argument, cite this Text perpetually by halfs; there being in the latter part of it, a clear, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Demonſtration, that you have nothing to do with the former. Unleſs you will ſay, which is moſt ridiculous, that when our Saviour ſaid, <hi>He will teach you,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>he will ſhew you,</hi> &amp;c. he meant one <hi>You</hi> in the former clauſe, and another <hi>You</hi> in the latter.</p>
                        <p n="73">73. Object. But this <hi>is to confine God's Spirit to the Apoſtles only, or to the Diſciples, that then were preſent with him: which is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to many places of Scripture.</hi> Anſw. I confeſs, that to confine the Spirit of God to thoſe that were then preſent with Chriſt is againſt Scripture. But, I hope, it is eaſie to conceive a difference, between confining the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> to them, and confining <hi>the promiſes made in this place</hi> to them. God may do many things which he doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe at all; much more, which he doth not promiſe in ſuch or ſuch a place.</p>
                        <p n="74">74. Object. But <hi>it is promiſed in the</hi> 14. <hi>Chap. that this Spirit ſhall abide with them for ever: Now they in their perſons were not to abide for ever, and therefore the Spirit could not abide with them, in their Perſons for ever, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the coexiſtence of two things, ſuppoſes of neceſsity, the exiſtence of either. Therefore the Promiſe was not made to them only in their Perſons, but by them to the Church, which was to abide for ever.</hi> Anſw. Your Concluſion is, <hi>not to them only,</hi> but your Reaſon concludes, either nothing at all, or that this Promiſe of abiding with them for ever, was not made to their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at all; or, if it were, that it was not performed, Or, if you will not ſay (as I hope you will not) that it was not performed, nor that it was not made to their Perſons at all; then muſt you grant, that the word <hi>for ever,</hi> is here uſed in a ſenſe reſtrained, and accommodated to the ſubject here entreated of; and that it ſignifies, <hi>not eternally,</hi> without end of time, <hi>but perpetually,</hi> without interruption, for the time of their lives. So that the force, and ſenſe of the words is, that they ſhould never want the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's aſſiſtance, in the performance of their function: And that the Spirit would not (as Chriſt was to do) ſtay with them for a time, and afterwards leave them, but would abide with them, if they kept their ſtation, unto the very end of their lives, which is mans <hi>for ever.</hi> Neither is this uſe of the word, <hi>for ever,</hi> any thing ſtrange, either in our ordinary ſpeech, wherein we uſe to ſay, This is mine for ever, This ſhall be yours for ever, without ever dreaming of the Eternity, either of the Thing or Perſons. And then in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, it not only will bear, but requires, this ſenſe very frequently, as <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od.</hi> 21.6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.17. <hi>His maſter ſhall bore his ear through with an awl, and he ſhall ſerve him for ever. Pſal.</hi> 52.9. <hi>I will praiſe thee for ever, Pſal.</hi> 61.4. <hi>I will abide in thy Tabernacle for ever, Pſal.</hi> 119.111. <hi>Thy Teſtimonies have I taken as mine heritage for ever.</hi> And laſtly, in the Ep.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64345:95"/>to <hi>Philemon, He therefore departed from thee for a time, that thou ſhouldſt receive him for ever.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="75">75. And thus, I preſume, I have ſhewed ſufficiently, that this <hi>for ever,</hi> hinders not, but that the promiſe may be appropriated to the Apoſtles, as by many other circumſtances I have evinced it muſt be. But what now, if the place produced by you, as a main pillar of your Churches Infallibility, prove upon trial, an engine to batter and overthrow it, at leaſt, (which is all one to my purpoſe) to take away all poſſibility of our aſſurance of it? This will ſeem ſtrange news to you at firſt hearing, and not far from a prodigy. And I confeſs, as you here in this place, and generally all your Writers of Controverſie, by whom this Text is urged, order the matter, it is very much diſabled, to do any ſervice againſt you in this queſtion. For with a bold ſacriledge, and horrible impiety, ſomewhat like <hi>Procruſtes</hi> his cruelty, you perpetually cut off the head and foot, the beginning and end of it; and preſenting to your Confidents, (who uſually read no more of the Bible, than is alledged by you) only theſe words, <hi>I will ask my Father, and he ſhall give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of Truth,</hi> conceal in the mean time, the words before, and the words after; that ſo, the promiſe of God's Spirit, may ſeem to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, whereas it is indeed moſt clearly and expreſly conditional: being doth in the words before, reſtrained to thoſe only, that <hi>love GOD, and keep his Commandments:</hi> and in the words after, flatly denied to all, whom the Scriptures ſtile by the name of <hi>the World,</hi> that is, as the very Antitheſis gives us plainly to underſtand, <hi>to all wicked and wordly men.</hi> Behold the place entire, as it is ſet down in your own Bible: <hi>If ye love me keep my Commandments, and I will ask my Father, and he ſhall give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of the Truth, whom the world cannot receive.</hi> Now from the place thus reſtored and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated from your mutilation, thus I argue againſt your pretence. We can have no certainty of the Infallibility of your Church, but upon this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that your Popes are infallible in confirming the Decrees of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councels: we can have no certainty hereof, but upon this ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Spirit of Truth is promiſed to them for their direction in this work: And of this again we can have no certainty, but upon ſuppoſal, that they perform the condition, whereunto the promiſe of the Spirit of Truth is expreſly limited, <hi>viz. That they love God and keep his Commandments:</hi> And of this finally, not knowing the Popes heart, we can have no certainty at all; therefore from the firſt to the laſt, we can have no certainty at all of your Churches Infallibility. This is my firſt Argument. Another fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, which will charge you as home as the former. If many of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> See, were ſuch men as could not receive the Spirit of Truth, even men of the World, that is, Wordly, Wicked, Carnal, Diabolical men; then the Spirit of Truth is not here promiſed, but flatly denied them: and conſequently we can have no certainty, neither of the Decrees of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, which theſe Popes confirm, nor of the Churches Infallibility, which is guided by theſe Decrees: But many of the <hi>Roman</hi> See, even by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the moſt zealous Defenders of it, were ſuch men: Therefore the Spirit of Truth is not here promiſed, but denied them; and conſequently we can have no certainty, neither of the Decrees, which they confirm, nor of the Churches Infallibility, which guides her ſelf by theſe Decrees.</p>

76. You may take as much time as you think fit, to anſwer theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. In the mean while I proceed to the conſideration of the next Text alledged for this purpoſe by you; out of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Ep. to <hi>Timothy,</hi> where he ſaith, as you ſay, <hi>The Church is the Pillar and Ground of Truth.</hi> But the truth is, you are ſomewhat too bold with S. <hi>Paul;</hi> For he ſays not in formal terms, what you make him ſay, <hi>The Church is the Pillar and Ground of Truth,</hi> neither is it certain that he means ſo: for it is neither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible nor improbable, that theſe words, <hi>the pillar and ground of truth,</hi> may have reference not to the Church, but to <hi>Timothy,</hi> the ſenſe of the place <hi>that thou maiſt know how to behave thy ſelf, as a Pillar and Ground of the Truth, in the Church of God, which is houſe of the living God,</hi> which expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition offers no violence at all to the words, but only ſuppoſes an <hi>Ellipſis</hi> of the Particle <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, in the Greek very ordinary. Neither wants it ſome likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> comparing the Church to a houſe, ſhould here exhort <hi>Timothy,</hi> to carry himſelf, as a Pillar in that houſe ſhould do, according as he had given other principal men in the Church, the name of Pillars; rather then having called the Church a <hi>Houſe,</hi> to call it preſently a <hi>Pillar;</hi> which may ſeem ſomewhat heterogeneous. Yet if you will needs have S. <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this not to <hi>Timothy,</hi> but to the Church, I will not contend about it any farther, then to ſay, Poſſibly it may be otherwiſe. But then ſecondly, I am to put you in mind, that the Church which S. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſpeaks of, was that in which <hi>Timothy</hi> converſed, and that was a Particular Church, and not the <hi>Roman;</hi> and ſuch you will not have to be Univerſally Infallible.</p>

Thirdly, if we grant you out of courteſie (for nothing can enforce us to it) that he both ſpeaks of the Univerſal Church, and ſays this of it; then I am to remember you, that many Attributes in Scripture, are not notes of performance, but of duty, and reach us not what the Thing or Perſon is of neceſſity, but what it ſhould be. <hi>Ye are the Salt of the Earth,</hi> ſaid our Saviour to his Diſciples: not that this quality was inſeparable from their Perſons, but becauſe it was their Office to be ſo. For, if they muſt have been ſo of neceſſity, and could not have been otherwiſe, in vain had he put in them fear of that which follows, <hi>If the Salt hath loſt his ſavour, wherewith ſhall it be ſalted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be caſt forth, and to be trodden under foot.</hi> So the Church may be by duty, the pillar and ground, that is, the Teacher of Truth, of all Truth, not only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but profitable to Salvation; and yet ſhe may neglect and violate this duty, and be in fact the teacher of ſome Error.</p>
                        <p n="78">78. Fourthly and laſtly, if we deal moſt liberally with you, and grant that the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of the Catholike Church, calls it the <hi>Pillar and Ground of Truth,</hi> and that not only becauſe it ſhould, but becauſe it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſhall and will be ſo, yet after all this, you have done nothing; your bridge is too ſhort to bring you to the bank where you would be, unleſs you can ſhew, that by Truth here is certainly meant, not only <hi>all neceſſary</hi> to ſalvation, but all that is profitable, abſolutely and <hi>ſimply All.</hi> For that the true Church always ſhall be the maintainer and teacher of all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Truth, you know we grant, and muſt grant; for it is of the eſſence of the Church to be ſo, and any company of men were no more a Church without it, than any thing can be a man, and not be reaſonable. But as a man may be ſtill a man, though he want a hand or an eye, which yet are profitable parts; ſo the Church may be ſtill a Church, though it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:64345:96"/>in ſome profitable truth. And as a man may be a man that hath ſome biles and botches on his body; ſo the Church may be the Church, though it have many corruptions both in doctrine and practice.</p>
                        <p n="79">79. And thus you ſee we are at liberty from the former places; having ſhewed that the ſenſe of them, either muſt or may be ſuch as will do your Cauſe no ſervice. But the laſt you ſuppoſe will be a Gordian knot, and tie us faſt enough: The words are, <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to the conſummation of Saints, to the work of the Miniſtery,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Until we all meet into the Unity of faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That we be not hereafter Children, waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and carryed up and down with every wind of Doctrin.</hi> Out of which words this is the only Argument which you collect, or I can collect for you.</p>
                        <p>There is no means to conſerve Unity of Faith, againſt every wind of Doctrin, unleſs it be a Church univerſally infallible.</p>
                        <p>But it is impious to ſay, There is no means to conſerve Unity of Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt every wind of Doctrin:</p>
                        <p>Therefore there muſt be a Church Univerſally Infallible. Whereunto I anſwer, that your Major is ſo far from being confirmed, that it is plainly confuted by the place alleadged. For that tels us of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means for this purpoſe, to wit, the <hi>Apoſtles, and Prophets, and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and Paſtors, and Doctors,</hi> which Chriſt gave upon his Aſcenſion, and that their <hi>conſummating the Saints, doing the work of the Miniſtery,</hi> and <hi>edifying the body of Chriſt,</hi> was the means to bring thoſe (which are there ſpoken of, be they who they will) to <hi>the Unity of Faith, and to perfection in Chriſt,</hi> that they might not be <hi>wavering, and carryed about with every wind of falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin.</hi> Now the Apoſtles, and Prophets, and Evangeliſts, and Paſtors, and Doctors, are not the preſent Church; therefore the Church is not the only means for this end, nor that which is here ſpoken of.</p>
                        <p n="80">80. Peradventure by <hi>he gave,</hi> you conceive, is to be underſtood, <hi>he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that he would give unto the worlds end.</hi> But what reaſon have you for this conceit? Can you ſhew that the word <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, hath this ſignification in other places, and that it muſt have it in this place? Or, will not this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation drive you preſently to this blaſphemous abſurdity, that God hath not performed his promiſe? Unleſs you will ſay, which for ſhame I think you will not, that you have now, and in all Ages ſince Chriſt have had Apoſtles, and Prophets, and Evangeliſts: for as for Paſtors, and Doctors alone, they will not ſerve the turn. For if God promiſed to give all theſe, then you muſt ſay, He hath given all, or elſe that he hath broke his promiſe. Neither may you pretend, that the <hi>Paſtors and Doctors were the ſame with the Apoſtles, and Prophets, and Evangeliſts, and therefore having Paſtors and Doctors, you have all.</hi> For it is apparent, that by theſe names, are denoted ſeveral Orders of men, clearly diſtinguiſhed and diverſified by the Original Text; but much more plainly by your own Tranſlations, for ſo you read it, <hi>ſome Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and ſome Prophets, and other ſome Evangeliſts, and other ſome Pastors and Doctors:</hi> and yet more plainly in the parallel place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. to which we are referred by your Vulgar Tranſlation, <hi>God hath ſet ſome in the Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecondarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers;</hi> therefore this ſubterfuge is ſtopped againſt you. Object. But <hi>how can they, which died in the firſt Age, keep us in Unity, and guard us from Error, that live now, perhaps in the laſt? This ſeems to be all one, as if a man ſhould ſay, that</hi> Alexander, <hi>or</hi> Julius Caeſar, <hi>ſhould quiet a mutiny in the King of</hi> Spain<hi>'s Army.</hi> Anſw. I
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:64345:97"/>hope you will grant, that <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> and <hi>Euclid,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Saluſt,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Livie,</hi> were dead many Ages ſince; and yet that we are now preſerved from error by them, in a great part of Phyſick, of Geometry, of Logick, of the <hi>Roman</hi> Story. But what if theſe men had writ by Divine Inſpiration, and writ compleat bodies of the Sciences they profeſſed, and writ them plainly and perſpicuouſly? You would then have granted, I believe, that their works had been ſufficient to keep us from error, and from diſſention in theſe matters. And why then ſhould it be incongruous to ſay, that the Apoſtles, and Prophets, and Evangeliſts, and Paſtors, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, which Chriſt gave upon his Aſcenſion, by their writings, which ſome of them writ, but all approved, are even now ſufficient means, to conſerve us in Unity of Faith, and guard us from error? Eſpecially, ſeeing theſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are, by the confeſſion of all parts, true and divine, and, as we pretend and are ready to prove, contain a plain and perfect Rule of Faith; and as the<note n="*" place="margin">Perron.</note> Chiefeſt of you acknowledge, <hi>contain immediately, all the Principal and fundamental Points of Chriſtianity,</hi> referring us to the Church and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition only for ſome minute particularities. But tell me I pray, the Biſhops that compoſed the Decrees of the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> and the Pope that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed them, are they means to conſerve you in Unity, and keep you from Error, or are they not? Peradventure you will ſay, <hi>Their Decrees are, but not their Perſons:</hi> but you will not deny I hope, that you owe your Unity, and freedome from Error, to the Perſons that made theſe Decrees: neither will they deny, that the writings which they have left behind them, are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for this purpoſe. And why may not then the Apoſtles writings be as fit for ſuch a purpoſe, as the Decrees of your Doctors? Surely, their intent in writing was to conſerve us in Unity of Faith, and to keep us from errour, and we are ſure God ſpake in them: but your Doctors from whence they are, we are not ſo certain. Was the Holy Ghoſt then unwilling, or unable to direct them ſo, that their writings ſhould be fit and ſufficient to attain that end they aimed at in writing? For if he were both able and willing to do ſo, then certainly he did do ſo. And then their writings may be very ſufficient means, if we would uſe them as we ſhould do, to preſerve us in Unity, in all neceſſary points of Faith, and to guard us from all pernitious Error.</p>

If yet you be not ſatisfied, but will ſtill pretend, that <hi>all theſe words by you cited, ſeem clearly enough to prove, that the Church is Univerſally Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, without which, Unity of Faith could not be conſerved againſt every wind of Doctrin:</hi> I anſwer, That to you which will not underſtand that there can be any means to conſerve the Unity of Faith, but only that which conſerves your Authority over the Faithful, it is no marvel that theſe words ſeem to prove, that the Church, nay that your Church is univerſally infallible. But we that have no ſuch end, no ſuch deſires, but are willing to leave all men to their liberty, provided they will not improve it to a Tyranny over others, we find it no difficulty to diſcern between <hi>dedit</hi> and <hi>promiſit, he gave at his Aſcenſion,</hi> and <hi>he promiſed to the worlds end.</hi> Beſides, though you whom it concernes, may haply flatter your ſelves, that you have not only Paſtors, and Doctors, but Prophets, and Apoſtles, and Evangeliſts, and thoſe diſtinct from the former ſtill in your Church; yet we that are diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſed perſons, cannot but ſmile at theſe ſtrange imaginations. Laſtly, though you are apt to think your ſelves ſuch neceſſary inſtruments for all
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:64345:97"/>good purpoſes, and that nothing can be well done unleſs you do it; that no unity or conſtancy in Religion can be maintained, but inevitably Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom muſt fall to ruin, and confuſion, unleſs you ſupport it: yet we that are indifferent, and impartial, and well content, that God ſhould give us his own favours, by means of his own appointment, not of our chooſing, can eaſily collect out of theſe very words, that not the Infallibility of your, or of any Church, but the <hi>Apoſtles, and Prophets, and Evangeliſts, &amp;c. which Chriſt gave upon his Aſcenſion,</hi> were deſigned by him, for the compaſſing all theſe excellent purpoſes, by their preaching while they lived, and by their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings for ever. And if they faile hereof, the Reaſon is not any inſufficiency or invalidity in the means, but the voluntary perverſneſs of the ſubjects they have to deal with: who, if they would be themſelves, and be content that others ſhould be, in the choice of their Religion, the ſervants of God and not of men; if they would allow, that the way to heaven is no narrower now, then Chriſt left it, his yoak no heavier then he made it; that the belief of no more difficulties, is required now to Salvation, than was in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church; that no error is in it ſelf deſtructive, and excluſive from Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now, which was not then; if, inſtead of being zealous Papiſts, earneſt Calviniſts, rigid Lutherans, they would become themſelves, and be content that others ſhould be plain and honeſt Chriſtians; if all men would believe the Scripture, and freeing themſelves from prejudice and paſſion, would ſincerely endeavour to finde the true ſenſe of it, and live according to it, and require no more of others, but to do ſo; nor denying their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to any that do ſo, would ſo order their publique ſervice of God, that all which do ſo may without ſcruple, or hypocriſie, or proteſtation againſt any part of it, joyn with them in it: who doth not ſee that ſeeing (as we ſuppoſe here, and ſhall prove hereafter) all neceſſary truths, are plainly and evidently ſet down Scripture, there would of neceſſity be among all men, in all things neceſſary, Unity of Opinion? And, notwithſtanding any other differences that are or could he, Unity of Communion, and Charity, and mutual toleration? By which means, all Schiſm and Hereſie would be bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the world, and thoſe wretched contentions which now read and tear in pieces, not the coat, but the members and bowels of Chriſt, which mutual pride and Tyrannie, and curſing, and killing, and damning, would fain make immortal, ſhould ſpeedily receive a moſt bleſſed cataſtrophe. But of this hereafter, when we ſhall come to the Queſtion of Schiſm, wherein I perſwade my ſelf, that I ſhall plainly ſhew, that the moſt vehement accuſers, are the greateſt offenders, and that they are indeed at this time, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Schiſmatiques, who make the way to heaven narrower, the yoak of Chriſt heavier, the differences of Faith greater, the conditions of Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Communion harder, and ſtricter, then they were made at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by Chriſt and his Apoſtles: they who talk of Unity, but ayme at Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunie, and will have peace with none, but with their ſlaves and vaſſals. In the mean while, though I have ſhewed how Unity of Faith, and Unity of Charity too, may be preſerved without your Churches Infallibility, yet ſeeing you modeſtly conclude from hence, not that your Church is, but only <hi>ſeems to be</hi> univerſally infallible, meaning to your ſelf, of which you are a better Judge than I: Therefore I willingly grant your Concluſion, and proceed.</p>

Whereas you ſay, <hi>you neither do, nor have any poſsible means to agree, as long as you are left to your ſelves:</hi> The firſt is very true, That while you differ, you do not agree. But for the ſecond, That you have no poſſible means of agreement, as long as you are left to your ſelves <hi>i. e.</hi> to your own reaſons and judgment, this ſure is very falſe, neither do you offer any proof of it, unleſs you intended this, that you <hi>do not</hi> agree, for a proof that you <hi>cannot;</hi> which ſure is no good conſequence, not halfe ſo good as this which I oppoſe againſt it: D. <hi>Potter</hi> and I, by the uſe of theſe means by you mentioned, do agree concerning the ſenſe of theſe places, therefore there is a poſſible means of agreement; and therefore you alſo, if you would

Or if there be no poſſible means to agree about the ſenſe of theſe Texts, whilſt we are left to our ſelves, then ſure it is impoſſible that we ſhould agree in your ſenſe of them, which was, That the Church is univerſally infallible. For if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us to agree in this ſenſe of them, then it were poſſible for us to agree. And why then ſaid you of the ſelf ſame Texts but in the page next before, <hi>Theſe words ſeem clearly enough to prove that the Church is Univerſally infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible.</hi> A ſtrange forgetfulneſs, that the ſame man, almoſt in the ſame breath, ſhould ſay of the ſame words, They ſeem cleerly enough to prove ſuch a Concluſion true, and yet that three indifferent men, all preſum'd to be lovers of Truth, and induſtrious ſearchers of it, ſhould have no poſſible means, while they follow their own reaſon to agree in the Truth of this Concluſion!</p>

Certainly, God is no way oblig'd either by his Promiſe or his Love to give us all things, that we may imagine would be convenient for us, as formerly I have proved at large. It is ſufficient that he denyes us nothing neceſſary to Salvation. <hi>Deus non deficit in neceſſariis, nee redundat in ſuperfluis:</hi> So D. <hi>Stapleton.</hi> But that the ending of all Controverſies, or having a certain means of ending them, is neceſſary to Salvation, that you have often ſaid and ſuppos'd, but never proved, though it be the main pillar of your whole diſcourſe. So little care you take how ſlight your Foundations are, ſo your Building make a fair ſhew. And as little care, how you commit thoſe faults your ſelf, which you condemn in others. For you here charge them with great impiety, who imagine that, <hi>God the lover of Souls, hath left no infallible means to determine all differences ariſing about the interpretation of Scripture, or upon any other occaſion:</hi> And yet afterwards being demanded by D. <hi>Potter, Why the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons between the Jeſuits and Dominicans remain undetermined?</hi> You return him this croſs Interrogatory, <hi>Who hath aſſured you that the Point wherein theſe learned men differ, is a revealed Truth, or capable of definition; or is not rather by plain Scripture indeterminable, or by any Rule of Faith?</hi> So then when you ſay, <hi>It were great impiety to imagine that God hath not left infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means to decide all differences;</hi> I may anſwer, It ſeems you do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve your ſelf. For in this Controverſie which is of as high conſequence as any can be, you ſeem to be doubtful whether there be any means to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it. On the other ſide, when you ask D. <hi>Potter, Who aſſured him that there is any means to determine this Controverſie?</hi> I anſwer for him, that you have; in calling it <hi>a great impiety to imagine that there is not ſome infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible means to decide this and all other differences ariſing about the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture, or upon any other occaſion.</hi> For what trick you can deviſe to ſhew that this difference between the Dominicans and Jeſuits, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes a difference about the ſenſe of many texts of Scripture and many other matters of moment, was not included under <hi>this and all other differences,</hi> I cannot imagine.

But if there be any infallible means to decide all differences, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you name them. <hi>You ſay, it is to conſult and hear Gods Viſible Church with ſubmiſsive acknowledgment of her Infallibility.</hi> But ſuppoſe the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be (as here it is) <hi>whether your Church be infallible,</hi> what ſhall decide that? If you would ſay (as you ſhould do) Scripture and Reaſon, then you foreſee that you ſhould be forced to grant, that theſe are fit means to decide this Controverſie, and therefore may be as fit to decide others. Therefore to avoid this, you run into a moſt ridiculous abſurdity, and tell us that this difference alſo, Whether the Church be infallible, as well as others, muſt be agreed by <hi>a ſubmiſsive acknowledgment of the Churches Infallibility.</hi> As if you ſhould have ſaid, My Bretheren, I perceive there is a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention amongſt you, whether the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be infallible? If you will follow my advice, I will ſhew you a ready means to end it; you muſt firſt agree that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is infallible, and then your contention whether the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be infallible, will quickly be at an end. Verily, a moſt excellent advice, and moſt compendious way of ending all Controverſies, even without troubling the Church to determine them! For why may not you ſay in all other differences, as you have done in this? Agree that the Pope is ſupream head of the Church: That the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament, is turned into the Body and Blood of Chriſt: That the Communion is to be given to Lay-men but in one kind:That Pictures may be worſhipped: That Saints are to be invocated: and ſo in the reſt: and then your differences about the Popes Supremacy, Tranſubſtantiation, and all the reſt, will ſpeedily be ended. If you ſay, the advice is good in this, but not in other caſes, I muſt requeſt you, not to expect alwaies, to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon your word, but to ſhew us ſome reaſon, why any one thing, namely the Churches Infallibility, is fit to prove it ſelf; and any other thing, by name the Popes Supremacy, or Tranſubſtantiation, is not as fit? Or if for ſhame you will at length confeſs, that the Churches infallibility is not fit to decide this difference, Whether the Church be infallible, then you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it is not fit to decide all: Unleſs you will ſay, it may be fit to decide all, and yet not fit to decide this, or pretend that this is not comprehended under all. Beſides, if you grant that your Churches Infallibility cannot poſſibly be well grounded upon, or decided by it ſelf, then having profeſſed before, that <hi>there is no poſsible means beſides this, for us to agree hereupon,</hi> I hope you will give me leave to conclude, that it is impoſſible upon good ground for us to agree that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is infallible. For certainly, light it ſelf is not more clear than the evidence of this Syllogiſm;</p>
                        <p>If there be no other means to make men agree upon your Churches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, but only this, and this be no means; then it is ſimply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for men upon good grounds to agree that your Church is infallible:</p>
                        <p>But there is (as you have granted) no other poſſible means to make men agree hereupon, but only a ſubmiſſive ackdowledgment of her Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, And this is apparently no means;</p>
                        <p>Therefore it is ſimply impoſſible for men upon good grounds to agree that your Church is infallible.</p>

You ſay, the Creed contains all Points neceſſary to be believed: Be it <hi>ſo.</hi> But doth it likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all Points not to be disbelieved? Certainly it doth not. For how many Truths are there in holy Scripture not contained in the Creed, which we are not obliged diſtinctly, and particularly to know and believe, but are bound under pain of damnation not to reject, as ſoon as we come to know that they are found in holy Scripture? And we having already ſhewed, that whatſoever is propoſed by God's Church as a Point of Faith, is infallibly a truth revealed by God; it followeth that whoſoever denyeth any ſuch Point, oppoſeth God's ſacred teſtimony, whether that Point be contained in the Creed, or no. In vain then, was your care imployed to prove that all Points of Faith neceſſary to be <hi>explicitely</hi> believed, are contained in the Creed. Neither was that the Catalogue which <hi>Charity Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken</hi> demanded. His demand was (and it was moſt reaſonable) that you would once give us a Liſt of all Fundamentals, the denyal whereof deſtroyes Salvation; whereas the denyal of other Points not Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental may ſtand with Salvation, although both theſe kinds of Points be equally propoſed as revealed by God. For if they be not equally propoſed, the difference will ariſe from diverſity of the <hi>Propoſal,</hi> and not of the <hi>Matter</hi> fendamental, or not fundamental. This Catalogue only, can ſhew how farre Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants may diſagree without breach of Unity in Faith; and upon this, may other matters depend according to the ground of Proteſtants. But you will never adventure to publiſh ſuch a Catalogue, I ſay more: You can not aſſigne any one Point ſo <hi>great,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="2">2. Nay, this your inſtance in the Creed is not only impertinent, but directly againſt you. For all Points in the Creed are not of their own nature Fundamental, as I ſhewed<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 3.</note> before: And yet it is damnable to deny any one Point contained in the Creed. So that it is cleer, that to make an error dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, it is not neceſſary that the matter be of it ſelf fundamental.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Moreover, you cannot ground any certainty upon the Creed it ſelf, unleſs firſt you preſuppoſe that the Authority of the Church is univerſally infallible, and conſequently that it is damnable to oppoſe her Declarations, whether they concerne matters great, or ſmall, contained, or not contained in the Creed. This is clear. Becauſe we muſt receive the Creed it ſelf upon the credit of the Church, without which we could not know that there was any ſuch thing as that which We call the <hi>Apoſtles Creed:</hi> and yet the Arguments whereby you endeavour to prove, that the Creed contains all Fundamental Points, are grounded upon ſuppoſition, that the <hi>Creed</hi> was made <hi>either by the Apoſtles themſelves, or by the</hi>

                        <hi>Church of their times from them:</hi> which thing we could not certainly know, if the ſucceeding and ſtill continued Church, may err in her Traditions: neither can we be aſſured, whether all Fundamental Articles which you ſay were out of the Scriptures, <hi>ſummed, and contracted into the Apoſtles Creed,</hi> were faithfully ſummed, and contracted, and not one pretermitted, altered, or miſtaken, unleſs we undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly know that the Apoſtles compoſed the Creed; and <hi>that</hi> they intended to contract all Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Points of Faith into it; or at leaſt <hi>that the Church of their times</hi> (for it ſeemeth you doubt whether
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64345:100"/>indeed it were compoſed by the Apoſtles themſelves) did underſtand the Apoſtles aright; and <hi>that the Church of their times,</hi> did intend that the Creed ſhould contain all Fundamental Points. For if the Church may err in Points not Fundamental, may ſhe not alſo err in the particulars which I have ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied? Can you ſhew it to be a Fundamental Point of Faith, that the Apoſtles intended to comprize all Points of Faith neceſſary to Salvation in the Creed? Your ſelf ſay no more than that it is very<note n="(c)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Pag.</hi> 241.</note> 
                        <hi>probable;</hi> which is far from reaching to a Fundamental Point of Faith. Your probability is grounded upon <hi>the Judgment of Antiquity, and even of the</hi> Roman <hi>Doctors,</hi> as you ſay in the ſame place. But if the Catholique Church may err, what certainty can you expect from Antiquity, or Doctors? Scripture is <hi>your</hi> total Rule of Faith. Cite therefore ſome Text of Scripture, to prove that the Apoſtles, or <hi>the Church of their times,</hi> compoſed the Creed, and compoſed it with a purpoſe that it ſhould contain all Fundamental Points of Faith. Which being impoſſible to be done, you muſt for the Creed it ſelf relie upon the infallibility of the Church.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Moreover, the Creed conſiſteth not ſo much in the words, as in their ſenſe and meaning. All ſuch as pretend to the name of Chriſtians, recite the Creed, and yet many have erred fundamentally, as well againſt the Articles of the Creed, as other Points of Faith. It is then very frivolous to ſay, The Creed containes all Fundamental Points, without ſpecifying, both in what ſenſe the Articles of the Creed be <hi>true,</hi> and alſo in what <hi>true</hi> ſenſe, they be <hi>fundamental.</hi> For, both theſe taskes, you are to perform, who teach that all Truth is not Fundamental: and you do but delude the ignorant, when you ſay, that the Creed,<note n="(d)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Pag.</hi> 216.</note> 
                        <hi>taken in a Catholique</hi> (e) <hi>ſenſe,</hi> comprehendeth all Points Fundamental; becauſe; with you, all <hi>Catholique ſenſe</hi> is not Fundamental: for ſo it were neceſſary to Salvation that all Chriſtians ſhould know the whole Scripture, wherein every leaſt Point hath a <hi>Catholique ſenſe.</hi> Or if, by Catholique ſenſe, you underſtand that ſenſe which is ſo univerſally to be known, and believed by all, that whoſoever fails therein cannot be ſaved, you trifle, and ſay no more than this, <hi>All Points of the Creed in a ſenſe neceſſary to Salvation, are neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> Or, <hi>All Points Fundamental, are Fundamental.</hi> After this manner it were an eaſie thing to make many true Prognoſtications, by ſaying, it will certainly rain, when it rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. You ſay the Creed<note n="(f)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Pag.</hi> 216.</note> was opened and explaind, <hi>in ſome parts</hi> in the Creeds of <hi>Nice,</hi> &amp;c. But how ſhall we underſtand the other <hi>parts,</hi> not explained in thoſe Creeds?</p>
                     <p n="5">5. For what Article in the Creed is more Fundamental, or may ſeem more clear, than that, wherein we believe <hi>JESUS CHRIST</hi> to be the Mediatour, Redeemer, and Saviour of Man-kind, and the Founder and Foundation of a <hi>Catholique Church</hi> expreſſed in the Creed? And yet about this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, how many different Doctrins are there, not only of old Heretiques, as <hi>Arius, Neſtorius, Eutiches, &amp;c.</hi> but alſo Proteſtants, partly againſt Catholiques, and partly againſt one another? For the ſaid main Article of Chriſt's being the <hi>only</hi> Saviour of the world, &amp;c. according to different ſenſes of diſagreeing Sects, doth involve theſe, and many other ſuch queſtions; That Faith in <hi>JESUS CHRIST</hi> doth juſtifie alone; that Sacraments have no efficiency in Juſtification; That Baptiſm doth not avail Infants for Salvation, unleſs they have an Act of Faith; That there is no Sacerdotal Abſolution from ſinnes; That good works proceeding from God's grace are not meritorious; That there can be no Satisfaction for the temporal puniſhment due to ſin, after the guilt or offence is pardoned; No Purgatory; No pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the dead; No Sacrifice of the Maſſe; No Invocation; No Mediation, or Interceſſion of Saints; No inherent Juſtice; No ſupream Paſtor, yea no Biſhop by divine Ordinance; No Real preſence; No Tranſubſtantiation, with divers others. And why? Becauſe (forſooth) theſe Doctrins derogate from the Titles of Mediator, Redeemer, Advocate, Foundation, &amp;c. Yea, and are againſt the truth of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours humane nature, if we believe divers Proteſtants, writing againſt Tranſubſtantiation. Let then any judicious man conſider, whether D. <hi>Potter,</hi> or others, do really ſatisfie, when they ſend men to the Creed for a perfect Catalogue, to diſtinguiſh Points Fundamental, from thoſe which they ſay are not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental. If he will ſpeak indeed to ſome purpoſe, let him ſay, This Article is underſtood in this ſenſe; and in this ſenſe it is fundamental. That other is to be underſtood in ſuch a meaning; yet according to that meaning, it is not ſo fundamental, but that men may diſagree, and deny it without damnation. But it were no policie for any Proteſtant to deal ſo plainly.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. But to what end ſhould we uſe many arguments? Even your ſelfe are forced to limit your own Doctrin, and come to ſay, that the Creed is a perfect Catalogue of Fundamental Points, <hi>taken as it was further opened and explained in ſome parts (by occaſion of emergent Hereſies) in the other Catholique Creeds of Nice, Conſtantinople,</hi>
                        <note n="(g)" place="margin">

                        <hi>Epheſus, Chalcedon, and Athanaſius.</hi> But this explication, or reſtriction over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth your aſſertion. For as the Apoſtles Creed was not to us a ſufficient Catalogue, till it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by the firſt Councel, nor then till it was declared by another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So now alſo, as new Hereſies may ariſe, it will need particular explanation againſt ſuch emergent errors; and ſo it is not yet, nor ever will be, of it ſelf alone, a particular Catalogue, ſufficient to diſtinguiſh betwixt fundamental, and not fundamental points.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. I come to the ſecond part: <hi>That the Creed doth not contain all main and principal Points of Faith.</hi> And to the end we may not ſtrive about things either granted by us both, or nothing concerning the point in queſtion. I muſt premiſe theſe Obſervations.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Firſt, That it cannot be denyed, but that the Creed is moſt full and complete, to that purpoſe for which the holy Apoſtles, inſpired by God, meant that it ſhould ſerve, and in that manner as they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, which was, not to comprehend all particular Points of Faith, but ſuch general heads, as were moſt befitting, and requiſite for preaching the Faith of Chriſt to Jews and Gentiles, and might be briefly and compendiouſly ſet down, and eaſily learned and remembred. And therefore, in reſpect of Gentiles, the Creed doth mention God as Creator of all things; and for both Jews and Gentiles, the Trinity, the Meſſias, and Saviour, his birth, life, death, reſurrection, and glory, from whom they were to hope remiſſion of ſinnes, and life everlaſting, and by whoſe ſacred Name they were to be diſtinguiſhed from all other profeſſions, by being called Chriſtians. According to which purpoſe S. <hi>Thomas of Aquine</hi>
                        <note n="(h)" place="margin">2.2. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>Art.</hi> 8.</note> doth diſtinguiſh all the Articles of the Creed into-theſe general heads: That ſome

This is life everlaſting, that they know thee true GOD, and whom thou haſt ſent JESUS CHRIST.</hi> But it was not their meaning to give us as it were a courſe of Divinity, or a Catechiſm or a particular expreſſion of all Poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s of Faith, leaving thoſe things to be performed, as occaſion ſhould require, by their own word or writing, for their time, and afterwards for their ſucceſſors in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church. Our queſtion then is not, Whether the Creed be perfect, as farre as the end for which it was compoſed, did require; For we believe and are ready to give our lives for this; but only we deny, that the Apoſtles did intend to compriſe therein all particular points of belief, neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as even by D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s own<note n="(k)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Pag.</hi> 235.215.</note> confeſſion, it doth not comprehend <hi>Agenda,</hi> or things belonging to practice, as <hi>Sacraments, Commandements,</hi> the acts of <hi>Hope,</hi> and duties of <hi>Charity,</hi> which we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not only to practiſe, but alſo to believe be divine infallible faith. Will he therefore inter that the Creed is not perfect, becauſe it contains not all thoſe neceſſary and fundamental Objects of Faith? He will anſwer, No, becauſe the Apoſtles intended only to expreſs <hi>credenda,</hi> things to be believed, not practiſed. Let him therefore give us leave to ſay, that the Creed is perfect, becauſe it wanteth none of thoſe Objects of belief which were intended to be ſet down as we explicated before.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The ſecond Obſervation is, that to ſatisfie our queſtion what Points in particular be fundamental, it will not be ſufficient to alleage the Creed, unleſs it contains all ſuch Points either expreſly, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly; or elſe in ſuch manner, that by evident and neceſſary conſequence they may be deduced from Articles both cleerly, and particularly contained therein. For if the deduction be <hi>doubtfull,</hi> we ſhall not be <hi>ſure,</hi> that ſuch Concluſions be fundamental: or if the Articles themſelves which are ſaid to be fundamental, be not diſtinctly, and particularly expreſſed, they will not ſerve us to know, and diſtinguiſh all Points Fundamental, from thoſe which they call, not Fundamental. We do not deny, but that all Points of Faith, both fundamental and not fundamental, may be ſaid to be contained in the Creed, in ſome ſenſe; as for example, implicitely, generally, or in ſuch involved maner. For when explicitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> we do not implicitely believe whatſoever ſhe propoſeth as belonging to Faith: Or elſe by way <hi>reduction,</hi> that is when we are once inſtructed in the belief of particular Points of Faith, not expreſſed, nor by neceſſary conſequence deducible from the Creed; we may afterward, by ſome ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, or proportion, and reſemblance, reduce it to one or-moe of thoſe Articles which are explicitely contained in the Symbole. Thus S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> the Cherubim among Divines, teacheth<note n="(l)" place="margin">2.2. <hi>q.</hi> 1, <hi>art.</hi> 8. <hi>ad</hi> 6.</note> that the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous exiſtence of our bleſſed Saviours body in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> as likwiſe all his other <hi>miracles</hi> are reduced to God's <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> expreſſed in the Creed.

                        <hi>being a Seal of that holy Union which we have with Chriſtour Head, by his Spirit and Faith, and with the Saints his Members by Charity, is evidently included in the Communion of Saints.</hi> But this reductive way, is far from being ſufficient to infer out of the Articles of <hi>God's Omnipotency,</hi> or of the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> that our Saviours body is in the Euchariſt, and much leſs whether it be only in figure, or elſe in reality; by Tranſubſtantiation, or Conſubſtantiation, &amp;c. and leaſt of all, whether or no theſe Points be Fundamental. And you hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolize, in ſaying, the Euchariſt is <hi>evidently included in the Communion of Saints,</hi> as if there could not have been, or was not, a Communion of Saints, before the bleſſed Sacrament was inſtituted. Yet it is true, that after we know, and believe, there is ſuch a Sacrament, we may referre it to ſome of thoſe heads expreſſed in the Creed, and yet ſo, as S. <hi>Thomas</hi> referrs it to one Article, and D. <hi>Potter</hi> to another; and in reſpect of different analogies or effects, it may be referred to ſeveral Articles. The like I ſay of other Points of Faith, which may in ſome ſort be reduced to the Creed, but nothing to D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s purpoſe: But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily it ſheweth, that your affirming ſuch and ſuch Points to be Fundamental or not Fundamental, is theerly arbitrary, to ſerve your turne, as neceſſity, and your occaſions may require. Which was an old cuſtome amongſt Heretiques, as we read in<note n="(n)" place="margin">De Pectat-Origai. <hi>2.5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p n="10">10. Out of that which hath been ſaid, I infer, that D. <hi>Potters</hi> pains in alleaging Catholique Doctors, the ancient Fathers, and the Council of Trent, to prove that the Creed contains all Points of Faith, was needleſs; ſince we grant it in manner aforeſaid. But D. <hi>Potter</hi> cannot in his conſcience believe, that Catholique Divines, or the Council of Trent, and the holy Fathers did intend, that all Points in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular which we are obliged to believe, are contained explicitely in the Creed; he knowing well enough, that all Catholiques hold themſelves obliged, to believe all thoſe Points which the ſaid Council define to be believed under an Anathema, and that all Chriſtians believe the Commandements, Sacraments &amp;c. which are not expreſſed in the Creed.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Neither muſt this ſeem ſtrange. For who is ignorant, that Summaries, Epitomes, and the like brief Abſtracts, are not intended to ſpecifie all particulars of that Science, or Subject, to which they belong. For as the Creed is ſaid to contain all Points of <hi>Faith;</hi> ſo the Decalogue comprehends all Articles (as I may term them) which concern <hi>Charity,</hi> and good life: and yet this cannot be ſo underſtood, as if we were diſobliged from performance of any duty, or the eſchewing of any vice, unleſs it be expreſſed in the ten Commandements. For, (to omit the precepts of receiving Sacraments, which belong to practice, or manners, and yet are not contained in the Decalogue) there are many ſins, even againſt the law of nature, and light of reaſon, which are not contained in the ten Commandements, except only by ſimilitude, analogie, reduction, or ſome ſuch way. For example, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> we find not expreſſed
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64345:101"/>in the Decalogue, either divers ſins, as Gluttony, Drunkenneſs, Pride, Sloth, Covetuouſneſs in deſiring either things ſuperfluous, or with too much greedineſs; or divers of our chiefe obligations, as Obedience to Princes, and all Superiours, not only Eccleſiaſtical, but alſo Civil, whoſe laws <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Calvin,</hi> and ſome other Proteſtants do dangerouſly affirme not to oblige in conſcience, and yet theſe men think they know the ten Commandements: as likwiſe divers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants defend Uſury, to be lawful; and the many Treatiſes of <hi>Civilians, Canoniſts,</hi> and <hi>Caſuiſts</hi> are witneſſes, that divers ſins againſt the light of reaſon, and Law of nature, are not diſtinctly expreſſed in the ten Commandements; although when by others diligence they are found unlawful, they may be reduced to ſome of the Commandements, and yet not ſo evidently, and particularly but that divers do it in divers manners.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. My third Obſervation is, That our preſent queſtion being Whether or no the Creed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo fully all Fundamental Points of Faith, that whoſoever do not agree in all, and every one of thoſe Fundamental Articles, cannot have the ſame ſubſtance of Faith, nor hope of Salvation; if I can produce one, or more Points, nor contained in the Creed, in which if two do not agree, both of them cannot expect to be ſaved, I ſhall have performed as much as I intend; and D. <hi>Potter</hi> muſt ſeek out ſome other Catalogue for Points Fundamental, than the Creed. Neither is it material to the ſaid purpoſe, whether ſuch Fundamental Points reſt only in knowledge, and ſpeculation, or belief, or elſe be farther referred to work and practice. For the <hi>habit,</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> vertue of <hi>Faith,</hi> which inclineth, and enableth us to believe both ſpeculative and practical verities, is of one and the ſelf ſame nature, and eſſence. For example, by the ſame <hi>Faith,</hi> whereby I ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively believe there is a God, I likewiſe believe, that he is to be adored, ſerved, and loved; which belong to practice. The reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>Formal Object,</hi> or motive, for which I yeeld aſſent to thoſe different ſorts of material objects, is the ſame in both, to wit, the revelation, or Word of God. Where, by the way I note, that if the <hi>Unity,</hi> or <hi>Diſtinction,</hi> and nature of Faith were to be taken from the diverſity of things revealed, by one faith I ſhould believe ſpeculative verities and by another ſuch as tend to practice, which I doubt whether D. <hi>Potter</hi> himſelf will admit.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Hence it followeth, that whoſoever denyeth any one main practical revealed truth is no leſſe an Heretique, than if he ſhould deny a Point reſting in belief alone. So that when D <hi>Potter</hi> (to avoid our argument, that all Fundamental Points are not contained in the Creed, becauſe in it there is no mention of the Sacraments, which yet are Points of ſo main importance, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants make the due adminiſtration of them, to be neceſſary and eſſential to conſtiture a Church) anſwereth, that the <hi>Sacraments are to be</hi>

Our queſtion is not, <hi>de nomine,</hi> but <hi>re;</hi> not what be called Points of Faith, or of Practice, but what Points indeed be neceſſarily to be believed, whether they be termed <hi>Agenda,</hi> or <hi>Credenda:</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the chiefeſt part of Chriſtian perfection conſiſting more in Action, than in barren Speculation; in good works, than bare belief; in doing, than knowing. And there are no leſs contentions concerning practical, than ſpeculative truths: as Sacraments, obtaining remiſſion of ſin, Invocation of Saints, Prayers for dead, Adoration of Chriſt in the Sacrament, and many other: all which do ſo much the more import, as on them, beſide right belief, doth alſo depend our practice, and the ordering of our life. Though D. <hi>Potter</hi> could therefore give us (as he will never be able to do) a minute, and exact Catalogue of all Truths to be believed; that would not make me able enough to know, whether or no I have Faith ſufficient for Salvation; till he alſo did bring in a particular Liſt, of all believed Truths, which tend to practice, declaring which of them be fundamental, which not; that ſo every man might know, whether he be not in ſome <hi>Damnable</hi> Error, for ſome Article of Faith, which farther might give influence into <hi>Damnable</hi> works.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Theſe Obſervations being premiſed, I come to prove, that the Creed doth not contain all Points of Faith neceſſary to be known and believed. And, to omit, that in general it doth not tell us, what Points be fundamental, or not fundamental, which in the way of Proteſtants is moſt neceſſary to be known; in particular, there is no mention of the greateſt evils, from which mans calamity proceeded, I mean, the ſin of the Angels, of <hi>Adam,</hi> and of Original ſin in us: nor of the greateſt Good from which we expect all good, to wit, the neceſſity of <hi>Grace</hi> for all works tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to piety.

It is not expreſſed whether the Article of <hi>Remiſſion of ſins</hi> be underſtood by Faith alone, or elſe may admit the efficiency of Sacraments.

There is nothing for Baptiſm of Children, nor againſt Re-baptization. There is no mention in favour, or againſt the Sacrifice of the Maſs, or Power in the Church to inſtitute Rites, Holy dayes, &amp;c. and to inflict Excommunication, or other Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: or Prieſthood, Biſhops, and the whole Eccleſiaſtical Hierarchy, which are very Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Points; of S. <hi>Peters</hi> Primacie, which to <hi>Calvin</hi> ſeemeth a fundamental error; not of the poſſibility, or impoſſibility to keep God's Commandements; of the proceſſion of the holy Ghoſt from the Father and Sonne; of Purgatory, or Prayer for the dead, in any ſenſe: And yet D. <hi>Potter</hi> doth not deny, but that <hi>Aerius</hi> was eſteemed an Heretique, for denying<note n="(r)" place="margin">

Nothing of the Churches Viſibility or Inviſibility, Fallibility, or Infallibility; nor of other Points controverted betwixt Proteſtants themſelves, and between Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and Catholiques, which to D. <hi>Potter</hi> ſeem ſo hainous corruptions, that they cannot without damnation joyn with us in profeſſion thereof. There is no mention of the Ceſſation of the Old Law, which yet is a very main Point of Faith. And many other might be alſo added.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. But what need we labour to ſpecifie particulars? There are as many important Points of Faith not expreſſed in the Creed, as, ſince the worlds beginning, now, and for all future times there have been, are, and may be innumerable, groſs, damnable Hereſies, whoſe contrary truths are not contained in the Creed. For, every, Fundamental Error muſt have a contrary Fundamental Truth; becauſe of two contradictory Propoſitions in the ſame degree, if the one is falſe, the other muſt be true. As for example, if it be a damnable error to deny the bleſſed Trinity, or the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of our Saviour, the <hi>belief</hi> of them muſt be a Truth neceſſary to Salvation; or rather, if we will ſpeak properly, the <hi>Error</hi> is damnable, becauſe the oppoſite <hi>Truth</hi> is neceſſary, as death is frightful, becauſe life is ſweet; and according to Philoſophy, the Privation is meaſured by the Forme to which it is repugnant. If therefore the Creed contain in particular all fundamental Points of Faith, it muſt explicitely, or by cleer conſequence, comprehend all Truths oppoſite to innumerable Hereſies of all Ages paſt, preſent, and to come, which no man in his wits will affirm it to do.</p>
                     <p n="16">16 And here I cannot omit to ſignifie how you<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">
                           <hi>Pag.</hi> 255.</note> applaud the ſaying of D. <hi>Uſher, That in thoſe Propoſitions which without all controverſie are univerſally received in the whole Chriſtian world, ſo much Truth is contained, as being joyned with holy Obedience, may be ſufficient to bring a man to everlaſting Salvation; neither have we cauſe to doubt, but that as many as walk according to this Rule (neither over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing that which they have builded, by ſuperinducing any damnable hereſies thereupon, nor otherwiſe vitiating their holy faith, with a lewd and wicked converſation) peace ſhall be upon them, and upon the Iſrael of God.</hi> Now D. <hi>Potter</hi> knows, that the Myſtery of the B. Trinity is not univerſally received in the whole Chriſtian world, as appears by very many Heretiques, in <hi>Polony, Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> and therefore according to this Rule of D. <hi>Uſher,</hi> approved by D. <hi>Potter,</hi> the denyal of the B. Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſhall not exclude Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Let me note, by the way, that you might eaſily have eſpied a foul contradiction in the ſaid words of D. <hi>Uſher,</hi> by you recited, and ſo much applauded. For he ſuppoſeth, that a man agrees with other Churches in belief, which joyned with holy Obedience may bring him to everlaſting Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and yet, that he may <hi>ſuperinduce damnable hereſies.</hi> For how can he <hi>ſuperinduce damnable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,</hi> who is ſuppoſed to believe all <hi>Truths</hi> neceſſary to Salvation? Can there be any damnable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, unleſs it contradict ſome neceſſary Truth, which cannot happen in one who is ſuppoſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all neceſſary <hi>Truths?</hi> Beſides, if one believing all Fundamental Articles in the Creed may <hi>ſuperinduce damnable haereſies,</hi> it followeth, that the Fundamental Truths contrary to thoſe damnable hereſies, are not contained in the Creed.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. According to this Model of D. <hi>Potters</hi> foundation, conſiſting in the agreement of ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one Point of Faith; what a ſtrange Church would he make of men concurring in ſome one or few Articles of belief, who yet for the reſt ſhould be holding conceits plainly contradictory: ſo patching up a Religion of men, who agree only in the Article, That Chriſt is our Saviour, but for the reſt, are like to the parts of a Chimaera; having the head of a man, the neck of horſe, the ſhoulder of an Oxe, the foot of a Lion, &amp;c. I wrong them not herein. For in good Philoſophie there is greater repugnancy between aſſent and diſſent, affirmation and negation, <hi>eſt, eſt, non, non,</hi> (eſpecially when all theſe contradictories pretend to relie upon one and the ſelf ſame <hi>Motive,</hi> the infallible Truth of Almighty God) than between the integral parts, as head, neck, &amp;c. of a man, horſe, lion, &amp;c. And thus Proteſtants are far more bold to diſagree even in matters of Faith, than Catholique Divines in queſtions meerly Philoſophical, or not determined by the Church. And while thus they ſtand only upon <hi>fundamental</hi> Articles, they do by their own confeſſion deſtroy the Church, which is the <hi>houſe of God.</hi> For the <hi>foundation</hi> alone of a houſe is not a houſe, nor can they in ſuch an imaginary Church any more expect Salvation, than the foundation alone of a houſe is fit to afford a man habitation.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. Moreover, it is moſt evident that Proteſtants by this Chaos rather than Church, do give unavoidable occaſion of deſperation to poor ſouls. Let ſome one who is deſirous to ſave his ſoul repair to D. <hi>Potter,</hi> who maintains theſe grounds, to know upon whom he may relie, in a matter of ſo great conſequence; I ſuppoſe the Doctors anſwer will be, Upon the truely Catholique Church.

They are thoſe grand, and capital Doctrins which make up our Faith in Chriſt; that is, that common Faith which is alike precious in all, being one and the ſame in the higheſt Apoſtle, and the meaneſt Believer, which the Apoſtle elſe-where cals the firſt Principles of the Oracles of God, and, the form of ſound words.</hi> But how ſhall I apply theſe general definitions, or deſcriptions, or (to ſay the truth) theſe only varied words and phraſes (for I underſtand the word <hi>fundamental,</hi> as well as the word <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, eſſential, grand, and capital doctrins,</hi> &amp;c.) to the particular Articles of the Creed, in ſuch ſort, as that I may be able preciſely, exactly, particularly, to diſtinguiſh Fundamental Articles from Points of leſs moment? You labour to tell us <hi>what</hi> Fundamental Points be, but not <hi>which</hi> they be: and yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you do this, your Doctrin ſerves only, either to make men diſpair, or elſe to have recourſe to thoſe whome you call Papiſts, and which give one certain Rule, that all Points defined by Chriſts viſible Church belong to the foundation of Faith, in ſuch ſenſe, as that to deny any one cannot ſtand with Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And ſeeing your ſelf acknowledges that theſe men do not err in Points Fundamental, I cannot but hold it moſt ſafe for me to joyn with them, for the ſecuring of my ſoul, and the avoiding of deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, into which this your Doctrin muſt caſt all them who underſtand, and believe it. For the whole diſcourſe, and inferences which here I have made, are either your own direct Aſſertions, or evident Conſequences cleerly deduced from them.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. But now let us anſwer ſome few Objections of D. <hi>Potters,</hi> againſt that which we have ſaid before, to avoid our argument, That the Scripture is not ſo much as mentioned in the Creed, he ſaith, <hi>The Creed is an abſtract of ſuch</hi>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">

                        <hi>neceſſary Doctrins as are delivered in Scripture,</hi> or collected out of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needs not expreſs the Authority of that which it ſuppoſes.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. This Anſwer makes for us. For by giving a reaſon why it was needleſs that Scripture ſhould be expreſſed in the Creed you grant as much as we deſire, namely, that the Apoſtles judged it <hi>needleſs</hi> to expreſs all neceſſary Points of Faith in their Creed. Neither doth the Creed ſuppoſe, or depend on Scripture, in ſuch ſort as that we can by any probable conſequence, inferr from the Articles of the Creed, that there is any Canonical Scripture at all; and much leſs that ſuch Books in particular be Canonical. Yea, the Creed might have been the ſame, although holy Scripture had never been written; and, which is more, the Creed even in priority of time, was before all the Scripture of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; except the Goſpel of S. <hi>Mathew.</hi> And ſo, according to this reaſon of his, the Scripture ſhould not mention Articles contained in the Creed. And I note in a word, how little connexion D. <hi>Potters</hi> arguments have, while he tels us, that <hi>The Creed</hi>
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">

                        <hi>is an Abſtract of ſuch neceſſary Doctrins as are delivered in Scripture, or collected out of it, and therefore needs not expreſs the authority of that which it ſuppoſes;</hi> it doth not follow: The Articles of the Creed are delivered in Scripture: therefore the Creed ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth Scripture. For two diſtinct writtings may well deliver the ſame Truths, and yet one of them not ſuppoſe the other, unleſs D. <hi>Potter</hi> be of opinion that two Doctors cannot, <hi>at one time,</hi> ſpeake the ſame truth.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. And notwithſtanding, that D. <hi>Potter</hi> hath now told us, it was <hi>needleſs</hi> that the Creed ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Scripture whoſe <hi>Authority it ſuppoſes?</hi> he comes at length to ſay, that the <hi>Nicene Fathers in their Creed confeſſing that the holy Ghoſt ſpake by the Prophets, doth thereby ſufficiently avow the divine Authority of all Canonical Scripture.</hi> But I would ask him, whether the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed be not alſo an Abſtract of Doctrins delivered in Scripture, as he ſaid of the Apoſtles Creed, and thence did infer, that it was needleſs to expreſs Scripture, <hi>whoſe authority it ſuppoſes?</hi> Beſides, we do not only believe in general, that Canonical Scripture is of divine Authority, but we are alſo bound under pain of damnation to believe, that ſuch and ſuch particular Books not mentioned in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, are Canonical. And laſtly D. <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in this anſwer grants as much as we deſire, which is, that all Points of Faith are not contained in the Apoſtles Creed, even as it is <hi>explained</hi> by other Creeds.

                     <p n="23">23. But, <hi>how can it be neceſſary</hi> (ſaith D. <hi>Potter</hi>) <hi>for any Chriſtian to have more in his Creed than the</hi>

                        <hi>ſo diſtinctly ſet down ſome, and be altogether ſilent of others?</hi> I anſwer, That you muſt anſwer your own demand. For in the Creed there be divers Points, in their nature, not fundamental or neceſſary to be explicitely and diſtinctly believed, as above we ſhewed; Why are theſe Points which are not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental expreſſed, rather than other of the ſame quality? Why our Saviours deſcent to Hell, and Burial expreſſed, and not his Circumciſion, his Manifeſtation to the three Kings, working of Miracles, &amp;c.? Why did they not expreſs Scriptures, Sacraments, and all Fundamental Points of Faith tending to practice, as well as thoſe which reſt in belief? Their intention was, particularly to deliver ſuch Articles as were fitteſt for thoſe times, concerning the Deity, Trinity, and Meſſias, (as heretofore I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) leaving many things to be taught by the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> which in the Creed we all profeſs to believe. Neither doth it follow, as you infer, <hi>That as well, nay better, they might have given no Article, but that (of the Church) and ſent us to the Church for all the reſt. For in ſetting down others beſides that, and not all, they make us believe we have all, when</hi>

                        <hi>we have not all.</hi> For by this kind of arguing, what may not be deduced? One might, quite contrary to your inference, ſay, If the Apoſtles Creed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all Points neceſſary to Salvation, what need we any Church to teach us? and conſequently what need of the Article concerning the <hi>Church?</hi> What need we the Creeds of <hi>Nice, Conſtantinople, &amp;c.?</hi> Superfluous are you Catechiſms, wherein, beſides the Articles of the Creed, you adde divers others par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. Theſe would be poor conſequences, and ſo is yours. But ſhall I tell you newes; For ſo you are pleaſed to eſteem it. We grant your inference thus far; That our Saviour Chriſt referred us to his Church, by her to be taught, and by her alone. For ſhe was before the Creed, and Scripture; And ſhe, to diſcharge this impoſed office of inſtructing us, hath delivered us the Creed, but not it alone, as if nothing elſe were to be believed. We have, beſides it, holy Scripture; we have unwritten, Divine, Apoſtolical, Eccleſiaſtical Traditions. It were a childiſh Argument, The Creed contains not all things which are neceſſary to be believed: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not profitable. Or, The Church alone, is ſufficient to teach us by ſome convenient means: <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſhe muſt teach us without all means, without Creeds, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Councils, without Scripture, &amp;c. If the Apoſtles had expreſſed no Article, but that of the Catholique Church, ſhe muſt have taught us the other Articles in particular, by Creeds, or other means as in fact we have even the Apoſtles Creed from the Tradition of the Church. It you will <hi>believe you have all in the Creed, when you have not all,</hi> it is not the Apoſtles, or the Church, that makes you ſo believe but it is your own error, whereby you will needs believe that the Creed muſt contain <hi>all.</hi> For neither the Apoſtles, nor the Church, nor the Creed it ſelf tell you any ſuch matter; and what neceſſity is there, that one means of inſtruction, muſt involve whatſoever is contained in all the reſt? We are not to recite the Creed with anticipated perſwaſions, that it muſt contain what we imagine it ought, for better maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome opinions of our own; but we ought to ſay, and believe, that it contains what we find in it; of which one Article is, to believe the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> ſurely to be taught by her, which preſuppoſeth that we need other inſtruction beſide the Creed: and in particular we may learn of her, what Points be contained in the Creed, what otherwiſe; and ſo we ſhall not be deceived, by beliving we have all in the Creed, when we have not all: and you may in the ſame manner ſay, <hi>As well nay better, the Apoſtles might have given us no Articles</hi> at all, as have left out Articles tending to practice. For in ſetting down one ſort of Articles, and not the other, <hi>they make us believe we have all, when we have not all.</hi>

Only concerning the Unity of Baptiſm againſt re-baptization of ſuch as were once baptized (which I noted as a Point not contained in the Apoſtles Creed) I cannot omit an excellent place of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> where, ſpeaking of the Donatiſts, he hath theſe words: <hi>They are ſo bold as</hi>

                        <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>D §. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Concerning the Creed's containing the Fundamentals of Chriſtianity, this is D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s Aſſertion, delivered in the 207. p. of his Book. <hi>The Creed of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles (as it is explained in the latter Creeds of the Catholique Church) is eſteemed a ſufficient Summary or Catalogue of Fundamentals, by the beſt learned Romaniſts, and by Antiquity.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. By <hi>Fundamentals</hi> he underſtands <hi>not the Fundamental Rules of good life and action,</hi> (though every one of theſe is to be believed to come from God, and therefore virtually includes an Article of Faith;) but the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental <hi>Doctrines of Faith,</hi> ſuch, as though they have influence upon our lives, as every eſſential doctrin of Chriſtianity hath, yet we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to believe them, and not to do them. The aſſent of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings is required to them, but no obedience from our wills.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. But theſe ſpeculative Doctrines again he diſtinguiſheth out of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, Occham,</hi> and <hi>Canus,</hi> and others, into two kinds: of the firſt are thoſe which are the <hi>Objects of Faith, in, and for themſelves,</hi> which by their own nature and God's prime intention, are eſſential parts of the Goſpel: ſuch as the Teachers in the Church, cannot without Mortal ſin omit to teach the learners: ſuch as are intrinſecal to the Covenant between God and man; and not only plainly revealed by God, and ſo certain truths, but alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be preacht to all men, and to be believed diſtinctly by all, and ſo <hi>neceſſary truths.</hi> Of the ſecond ſort are <hi>Accidental, Circumſtantial, Occaſional</hi> objects of Faith; millions whereof there are in holy Scripture; ſuch as are to be believed, not for themſelves, but becauſe they are joyned with others that are neceſſary to be believed, and delivered by the ſame Authority which delivered theſe. Such as we are not bound to know to be divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, (for without any fault we may be ignorant hereof, nay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the contrary;) ſuch as we are not bound to examine, Whether or no
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:64345:103"/>they be divine Revelations: ſuch as Paſtors are not bound to teach their Flock, nor their Flock bound to know and remember: no nor the Paſtors themſelves to know them or believe them, or not to disbelieve them abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and always; but then only when they do ſee, and know them to be delivered in Scripture, as divine Revelations.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. I ſay when they do ſo, and not only when they may do. For to lay an obligation upon us of believing, or not disbelieving any Verity, ſufficient Revelation on God's part, is not ſufficient: For then, ſeeing all the expreſs Verities of Scripture are either to all men, or at leaſt to all learned men ſufficiently revealed by God, it ſhould be a damnable ſin, in any learned man actually to disbelieve any one particular Hiſtorical verity contained in Scripture, or to believe the contradiction of it, though he knew it not to be there contained. For though he did not, yet he might have known it; it being plainly revealed by God, and this revelation being extant in ſuch a Book, wherein he might have found it recorded, if with diligence he had peruſed it. To make therefore any Points neceſſary to be believed, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that either we actually know them to be divine Revelations: and theſe though they be not Articles of Faith, nor neceſſary to be believed, in and for themſelves, yet indirectly, and by accident, and by conſequence, they are ſo: The neceſſity of believing them, being in forced upon us by a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of believing this Eſſential, and Fundamental Article of Faith, <hi>That all Divine Revelations are true,</hi> which to disbelieve, or not to believe, is for any Chriſtian not only impious, but impoſſible. Or elſe it is requiſite that they be, Firſt actually, revealed by God: Secondly, commanded under pain of damnation, to be particularly known (I mean known to be divine Revelations,) and diſtinctly to be believed. And of this latter ſort of ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative divine Verities, D. <hi>Potter</hi> affirmed, <hi>that the Apoſtles Creed was a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſummary:</hi> yet he affirmed it, not as his own opinion, but as the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the <hi>ancient Fathers, and your own Doctors.</hi> And beſides, he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not as abſolutely certain, but very probable.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. In brief, all that he ſays is this: It is <hi>very probable, that according to the judgment of the</hi> Roman <hi>Doctors, and the Ancient Fathers, the Apoſtles Creed is to be èſteemed a ſufficient ſummary of all thoſe Doctrines which being meerly</hi> Credenda, <hi>and not</hi> Agenda, <hi>all men are ordinarily, under pain of damnation, bound particularly to believe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. <hi>Now this Aſſertion</hi> (you ſay) <hi>is neither pertinent to the queſtion in hand, nor in it ſelf true.</hi> Your Reaſons to prove it <hi>impertinent,</hi> put into form and diveſted of impertinencies, are theſe. 1. <hi>Becauſe the queſtion was not, What Points were neceſſary to be explicitely believed, but what Points were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary not to be disbelieved after ſufficient propoſal. And therefore to give a Catalogue of Points neceſſary to be explicitely believed, is impertinent.</hi>

                        <p n="7">7. <hi>Secondly, becauſe errors may be damnable, though the contrary truths be not of themſelves fundamental; as, that</hi> Pontius Pilate <hi>was our Saviours Judg, is not in it ſelf a Fundamental Truth, yet to believe the contrary were a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable error. And therefore to give a Catalogue of Truths in themſelves funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, is no pertinent ſatisfaction to this demand, what errors are damnable?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">8. <hi>Thirdly, becauſe if the Church be not univerſally infallible, we cannot ground any certainty upon the Creed, which we muſt receive upon the credit of the Church: and, if the Church be univerſally infallible, it is damnable to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her declaration in any thing, though not contained in the Creed.</hi>

9. <hi>Fourthly, becauſe not to believe the Articles of the Creed in the true ſenſe is damnable, therefore it is frivolous to ſay, the Creed contains all Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, without ſpecifying in what ſenſe the Articles of it are fundamental.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">10. <hi>Fifthly, becauſe the Apoſtles Creed</hi> (<hi>as D.</hi> Potter <hi>himſelf confeſſeth</hi>) <hi>was not a ſufficient Catalogue, till it was explained by the firſt Councel; nor then until it was declared in the ſecond,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by occaſion of emergent Hereſies: Therefore now alſo, as new Hereſies may ariſe, it will need particular explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſo is not yet, nor ever will be, a compleat Catalogue of Fundamentals.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="11">11. Now to the firſt of theſe Objections I ſay, Firſt, that your diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between Points neceſſary to be believed, and neceſſary not to be disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, is more ſubtil than ſound; a diſtinction without a difference: There being no Point neceſſary to be believed; which is not neceſſary not to be disbelieved: Nor no Point to any man, at any time, in any circumſtances, neceſſary not to be disbelieved, but it is to the ſame man, at the ſame time, in the ſame circumſtances, neceſſary to be believed. Yet that which (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) you would have ſaid, I acknowledge true, that many Points which are not neceſſary to be believed abſolutely, are yet neceſſary to be believed upon a ſuppoſition, that they are known to be revealed by God: that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come then neceſſary to be believed, when they are known to be Divine Revelations. But then I muſt needs ſay, you do very ſtrangely, in ſaying, That <hi>the Queſtion was, What Points might lawfully be disbelieved, after ſufficient Propoſition that they are divine Revelation.</hi> You affirm, that none may; and ſo doth D. <hi>Potter,</hi> and with him all Proteſtants, and all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. And how then is this the queſtion? Who ever ſaid or thought, that of Divine Revelations, known to be ſo, ſome might ſafely and lawfully be rejected, and disbelieved, under pretence that they are not Fundamental? Which of us ever taught, that it was not damnable, either to deny, or ſo much as doubt of the Truth of any thing, whereof we either know, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that God hath revealed it? What Proteſtant ever taught that it was not damnable, either to give God the lye, or to call his Veracity into queſtion? Yet you ſay, <hi>The demand of Charity Miſtaken was, and it was moſt reaſonable, that a Liſt of Fundamentals ſhould be given, the denial whereof deſtroys Salvation, whereas the denial of other Points may ſtand with Salvation, although both kinds be equally propoſed, as revealed by God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="12">12. Let the Reader peruſe <hi>Charity Miſtaken,</hi> and he ſhall find that this qualification, <hi>although both kinds of Points be equally propoſed as revealed by God,</hi> is your addition, and no part of the demand. And if it had, it had been moſt unreaſonable, ſeeing he and you know well enough, that (though we do not preſently without examination, fall down and worſhip all your Churches Propoſals, as divine Revelations) yet, we make no ſuch diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of known divine Revelations, as if ſome only of them were neceſſary to be believed, and the reſt might ſafely be rejected. So that to demand a particular minute Catalogue of all Points that may not be disbelieved af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſufficient Propoſition, is indeed to demand a Catalogue of all Points that are or may be, in as much as none may be disbelieved, after ſufficient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that it is a divine Revelation. At leaſt it is to deſire us, Firſt, To tranſcribe into this Catalogue, every Text of the whole Bible. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſet down diſtinctly, thoſe innumerous millions of negative and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive conſequences, which may be evidently deduced from it: For theſe we ſay, God hath revealed. And indeed you are not aſhamed in plain
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64345:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>terms to require this of us. For having firſt told us, <hi>that the command was What points were neceſſary not to be disbelieved, after ſufficient propoſition that they are Divine Truths:</hi> you come to ſay, <hi>Certainly the Creed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains not all theſe.</hi> And this you prove by asking, <hi>How many Truths are there in holy Scripture, not contained in the Creed, which we are not bound to know and believe, but are bound under pain of damnation not to reject, as ſoon as we come to know that they are found in holy Scripture?</hi> So that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a particular Catalogue of all Points not to be disbelieved, after ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Propoſal, you require us to ſet you down all Points contained in Scripture, or evidently deducible from it. And yet this you are pleaſed to call a <hi>reaſonable,</hi> nay, <hi>a moſt reaſonable Demand:</hi> whereas having ingaged your ſelf to give a Catalogue of your Fundamentals, you conceive your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement very well ſatisfied by ſaying, <hi>All is Fundamental which the Church propoſeth,</hi> without going about to give us an endleſs Inventory of her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals. And therefore from us, inſtead of a perfect Particular of Divine Revelations of all ſorts, (of which with a leſt Hyperbole than S. <hi>John</hi> uſeth, we might ſay, <hi>If they were to be written, the world would not hold the books that muſt be written;</hi>) me-thinks you ſhould accept of this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, All Divine Revelations are true, and to be believed. Which yet I ſay, not as if I thought the belief of this General ſufficient to Salvation; but becauſe I conceive it as ſufficient as the belief of your General: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſaid not, <hi>Me-thinks all ſhould accept of this General,</hi> but, <hi>Me-thinks you ſhould accept of it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="13">13. The very truth is, The main Queſtion in this buſineſs is not, <hi>What divine Revelations are neceſſary to be believed, or not rejected when they are ſufficiently propoſed:</hi> for all without exception, all without queſtion are ſo; But <hi>what Revelations are ſimply and abſolutely neceſſary to be propoſed to the belief of Chriſtians, ſo that that Society, which doth propoſe, and indeed believe them, hath for matter of Faith, the eſſence of a true Church; that which doth not, hath not.</hi> Now to this Queſtion, though not to yours, D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s Aſſertion (if it be true) is apparently very pertinent. And though not a full and total ſatisfaction to it, yet very effectual, and of great moment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it. For the main Queſtion being, What Points are neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: and Points neceſſary to Salvation, being of two ſorts, ſome of <hi>ſimple belief,</hi> ſome of <hi>Practice and Obedience,</hi> he that gives you a ſufficient ſummary of the firſt ſort of neceſſary Points, hath brought you half way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards your journies end. And therefore that which he doth, is no more to be ſlighted, as vain and impertinent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than an Architect's work is to be thought impertinent towards the making of a houſe, becauſe he doth it not all himſelf. Sure I am, if his Aſſertion be true, as I believe it is, a Corolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may preſently be deduced from it, which, if it were embraced cannot in all reaſon, but do infinite ſervice, both to the Truth of Chriſt, and the peace of Chriſtendom. For ſeeing falſhood and errour could not long ſtand againſt the power of Truth, were they not ſupported by Tyranny and worldly advantages, he that could aſſert Chriſtians to that liberty which Chriſt and his Apoſtles left them, muſt needs do Truth a moſt Heroical ſervice. And ſeeing the overvaluing of the differences among Chriſtians, is one of the greateſt maintainers of the Schiſms of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he that could demonſtrate, that only thoſe Points of Belief are ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply neceſſary to Salvation, wherein Chriſtians generally agree, ſhould he
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64345:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>not lay a very fair and firm foundation of the peace of Chriſtendom? Now the Corollary, which, I conceive, would produce theſe good effects, and which flows naturally from D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s Aſſertion, is this, <hi>That what Man or Church ſoever believes the Creed, and all the evident conſequences of it ſincerely and heartily, cannot poſsibly (if alſo he believe the Scripture) be in any Error of ſimple belief which is offenſive to God: nor therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for any ſuch Error to be deprived of his life, or to be cut off from the Churches Communion, and the hope of Salvation.</hi> And the production of this again would be this (which highly concerns the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to think of,) <hi>That whatſoever Man or Church doth for any error of ſimple belief, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive any man ſo qualified as above, either of his temporal life, or livelihood, or liberty, or of the Churches Communion, and hope of Salvation, is for the firſt, unjuſt, cruel, and tyrannous: Schiſmatical, preſumptuous, and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the ſecond.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="13">13. Neither yet is this (as you pretend) to take away the neceſſity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving thoſe verities of Scripture, which are not contained in the Creed, when once we come to know that they are written in Scripture, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lay a neceſsity upon men of believing all things written in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, when once they know them to be there written. For he that believes not all known Divine Revelations to be true, How doth he believe in God? Unleſs you will ſay, that the ſame man, at the ſame time, may not believe God, and yet believe in him. The greater difficulty is, How it will not take away the neceſſity of believing Scripture to be the Word of God? But that it will not neither. For though the Creed be granted a ſufficient Summary of <hi>Articles of meer Faith,</hi> yet no man pretends that it contains the <hi>Rules of obedience;</hi> but for them, all men are referred to Scripture. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, he that pretends to believe in God, obligeth himſelf to believe it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to obey that which Reaſon aſſures him to be the Will of God. Now Reaſon will aſſure him that believes the Creed, that it is the Will of God he ſhould believe the Scripture: even the very ſame Reaſon which moves him to believe the Creed: Univerſal, and never-failing Tradition, having given this teſtimony both to Creed and Scripture, that they both by the works of God were ſealed, and teſtified to be the words of God. And thus much be ſpoken in Anſwer to your firſt Argument; the length whereof will be the more excuſable, if I oblige my ſelf to ſay but little to the Reſt.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. I come then <hi>to your ſecond.</hi> And, in Anſwer to it, deny flatly, as a thing deſtructive of it ſelf, that any Error can be damnable, unleſs it be repugnant immediatly or mediatly, directly or indirectly, of it ſelf or by accident, to ſome Truth for the matter of it Fundamental. And to your example of <hi>Pontius Pilat's being Judge of Chriſt,</hi> I ſay, the denial of it in him that knows it to be revealed by God, is manifeſtly deſtructive of this Fundamental Truth, that <hi>All Divine Revelations are true.</hi> Neither will you find any error ſo much as by accident damnable, but the rejecting of it will be neceſſarily laid upon us, by areal belief of all Fundamentals, and ſimply neceſſary Truths. And I deſire you would reconcile with this, that which you have ſaid <hi>§.</hi> 15. <hi>Every Fundamental Error muſt have a contrary Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Truth, becauſe, of two Contradictory Propoſitions, in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the one is falſe, the other muſt be true,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. <hi>To the Third</hi> I anſwer, That the certainty I have of the Creed, that
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64345:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>it was from the Apoſtles, and contains the Principles of Faith, I ground it not upon Scripture, and yet not upon the Infallibility of any preſent, much leſs of your Church, but upon the Authority of the Ancient Church, and written Tradition, which (as D. <hi>Potter</hi> hath proved) gave this conſtant teſtimony unto it. Beſides, I tell you, it is guilty of the ſame fault which D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s Aſſertion is here accuſed of: having perhaps ſome colour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the proving it falſe, but none at all to ſhew it impertinent.</p>

                        <p n="18">18. <hi>Your fifth and laſt Objection</hi> ſtands upon a falſe and dangerous ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: That <hi>new Hereſies may ariſe.</hi> For an Hereſie being in it ſelf no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a Doctrin Repugnant to ſome Article of the Chriſtian Faith, to ſay that new Hereſies may ariſe, is to ſay, that new Articles of Faith may ariſe: and ſo ſome great Ones among you ſtick not to profeſs in plain terms, who yet at the ſame time are not aſhamed to pretend that your whole Doctrin is Catholique and Apoſtolique. So <hi>Salmeron: Non omnibus omnia dedit Deus, ut quaelibet aetas ſuis gaudeat veritatibus, quas prior aetas ignoravit. God hath not given all things to 'All: So that every Age hath its proper verities, which the former Age was ignorant of:</hi> Diſ. 57. in Epiſt. ad <hi>Rom.</hi> And again in the Margent, <hi>Habet unumquodque ſaecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64345:106"/>peculiares revelationes divinas, Every Age hath its peculiar Divine Revelations.</hi> Where that he ſpeaks of ſuch Revelations, as are, or may by the Church be made matters of Faith, no man can doubt that reads him; an example whereof, he give us a little before in theſe words, <hi>Unius Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtini doctrina Aſſumptionis B. Deiparae cultum in Eccleſiam introduxit. The Doctrin of</hi> Auguſtine <hi>only, hath brought into the Church the Worſhip of the Aſſumption of the Mother of God,</hi> &amp;c. Others again mince and palliate the matter with this pretence, that your Church undertakes not to coyn new Articles of Faith, but only to declare thoſe that want ſufficient Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But if ſufficient declaration be neceſſary to make any Doctrin an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith, then this Doctrin, which before wanted it, was not before an Article of Faith; and your Church by giving it the Eſſential form, and laſt complement of an Article of Faith, makes it, though not a Truth, yet certainly an Article of Faith. But I would fain know, whether Chriſt and his Apoſtles knew this Doctrin, which you pretend hath the matter, but wants the form of an Article of Faith, that is, <hi>ſufficient declaration,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they knew it to be a neceſſary Article of the Faith, or no. If they knew it not to be ſo, then either they taught what they knew not, which were very ſtrange; or elſe they taught it not: and if not, I would gladly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, ſeeing you pretend to no new Revelations, From whom you learned it? If they knew it, then either they concealed or declared it. To ſay, they concealed any neceſſary part of the Goſpel, is to charge them with far greater ſacriledge, than what was puniſhed in <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira.</hi> It is to charge theſe glorious Stewards, and Diſpenſers of the Myſteries of Chriſt, with want of the great vertue requiſite in a Steward, which is <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity.</hi> It is to charge them with preſumption for denouncing Anathema's, even to Angels, in caſe they ſhould teach any other Doctrin, than what they had received from them, which ſure could not merit an Anathema, if they left any neceſſary part of the Goſpel untaught. It is in a word, in plain terms to give them the lye, ſeeing they profeſs plainly and frequently, that they taught Chriſtians the whole <hi>Doctrin of Chriſt.</hi> If they did know and declare it, then it was a full and formal Article of faith; and the contrary a full and formal Hereſie, without any need of further declaration; and then their Succeſſors either continued the declaration of it, or diſcontinued it: If they did the latter, How are they ſuch faithful Depoſitaries of Apoſtolique Doctrin as you pretend? Or, what aſſurance can you give us, that they might not bring in new and falſe Articles, as well as ſuffer the oldand true ones to be loſt? If they did continue the declaration of it, and deliver it to their Succeſſors, and they to theirs, and ſo on perpetually; then continued it ſtill a full and formal Article of Faith, and the repugnant doctrin a full and formal Hereſie, without and before the definition or declaration of a Councel. So that Councels, as they cannot make that a truth or falſhood, which before was not ſo: ſo neither can they make or declare that to be an Article of Faith, or an Hereſie, which before was not ſo. The ſuppoſition therefore on which this Argument ſtands, being falſe and ruinous, whatſoever' is built upon it, muſt together with it fall to the ground. This explication therefore, and reſtriction of this doctrin, (whereof you make your advantage) was to my underſtanding unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. The Fathers of the Church in after-times might have juſt cauſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their judgment, touching the ſenſe of ſome general Articles of the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64345:106"/>Creed: but to oblige others to receive their declarations under pain of damnation, what warrant they had, I know not. He that can ſhew, either that the Church of all Ages was to have this Authority, or that it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church for ſome Ages, and then expired: He that can ſhew ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe things, let him: for my part, I cannot. Yet I willingly confeſs the judgment of a Councel, though not infallible, is yet ſo far directive, and obliging, that without apparent reaſon to the contrary, it may be ſin to reject it, at leaſt not to afford it an outward ſubmiſſion for publique peace ſake.</p>
                        <p n="19">19. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 7, 8, 9. Were I not peradventure more fearful than I need to be of the imputation of tergiverſation, I might very eaſily rid my hands of the remainder of this Chapter: For in the Queſtion there diſcuſſed, you grant (for ought I ſee) as much as D. <hi>Potter</hi> deſires; and D. <hi>Potter</hi> grants as much as you deſire: and therefore that I ſhould diſeaſe my ſelf, or my Reader with a punctual examination of it, may ſeem ſuperfluous. Firſt, that which you would have, and which your Arguments wholly drive at, is this, That <hi>the Creed doth not contain all main and principal points of Faith of all ſorts, whether they be ſpeculative, or practical,</hi> where they contain matter of ſimple belief, or whether they contain matter of practice and obedience. This D. <hi>Potter</hi> grants, <hi>page</hi> 215.235. And you grant that he grants it, §. 8. Where your words are, <hi>even by D.</hi> Potter's <hi>own confeſſion, it (the Creed) doth not comprehend</hi> Agenda, <hi>or things belonging to practice, as Sacraments, Commandements, the Acts of Hope, and duties of Charity.</hi> And if you will inferr from hence, that therefore <hi>C.M.</hi> hath no reaſon to reſt in the Apoſtles Creed, as a perfect catalogue of Fundamentals, and a full ſatisfaction to his demand, I have without any offence of D. <hi>Potter,</hi> granted as much, if that would content you. But ſeeing you go on, and, becauſe his aſſertion is not (as neither is it pretended to be) a total ſatisfaction to the demand, caſheer it as impertinent, and nothing towards it, here I have been bold to ſtop your proceeding, as unjuſt and unreaſonable. For, as if you ſhould requeſt a Friend to lend you, or demand of a debtor to pay you, a hundred pounds, and he could or ſhould let you have but fifty, this were not fully to ſatisfie your demand, yet ſure it were not, to do nothing towards it: Or, as this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder of mine, though it be not an anſwer to all your Book, but only to the Firſt conſiderable Part of it, and ſo much of the Second as is material, and falls into the firſt, yet I hope you will not deal ſo unkindly with me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> as for this reaſon, to condemn it of impertinence: So D. <hi>Potter</hi> being demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Catalogue of Fundamentals of Faith, and finding them of two kinds, and thoſe of one kind ſumm'd up to his hand in the Apoſtles Creed, and this Creed conſigned unto him for ſuch a ſummary by very great Authority; if upon theſe conſiderations he hath intreated his Demander to accept of thus much in part of payment, of the Apoſtles Creed, as a ſufficient Summary of theſe Articles of Faith, which are, <hi>meerly Creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> me-thinks he hath little reaſon to complain, that he hath not been fairly, and ſquarely dealt with. Eſpecially, ſeeing, for full ſatisfaction, by D. <hi>Potter</hi> and all Proteſtants he is referred to Scripture, which we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm contains evidently all neceſſary points of Faith, and rules of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: and ſeeing D. <hi>Potter</hi> in this very place hath ſubjoyned, though not a Catalogue of Fundamentals, which (becauſe to ſome more is Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, to others leſs, to others nothing at all) had been impoſſible, yet ſuch a comprehenſion of them, as may ſerve every one that will
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:64345:107"/>make a conſcionable uſe of it, inſtead of a Catalogue. For thus he ſays, <hi>It ſeems to be Fundamental to the Faith, and for the ſalvation of every Member of the Church, that he acknowledg and believe all ſuch Points of Faith, whereof he may be ſufficiently convinced that they belong to the Doctrin of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This general rule, if I ſhould call a Catalogue of Fundamentals, I ſhould have a Preſident for it with you above exception, I mean your Self; for, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. §. 19. juſt ſuch another Propoſition you have called by this name. Yet becauſe it were a ſtrange figure of ſpeech, I forbear it; only I will be bold to ſay, that this Aſſertion is as good a Catalogue of Fundamentals, as any you will bring of your Church Propoſals, though you take as much time to do it, as he that undertook to make an Aſs ſpeak.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. I come now to ſhew that you alſo have requited D. <hi>Potter</hi> with a mutual courteous acknowledgment of his Aſſertion, That the Creed is a ſufficient Summary of all the neceſſary Articles of Faith, which are meerly <hi>Credenda.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="21">21. Firſt then, §. 8. you have theſe words, <hi>It cannot be denyed that the Creed is moſt full and compleat to that purpoſe, for which the holy Apoſtles, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by God, meant that it ſhould ſerve, and in that manner as they did intend it, which was, not to comprehend all particular. Points of Faith, but ſuch gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral heads as were moſt befitting and requiſite for preaching the Faith of Chriſt, to</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and might be briefly and compendiouſly ſet down, and eaſily learned and remembred.</hi> Theſe words, I ſay, being fairly examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without putting them on the rack, will amount to a full acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of D. <hi>Potters.</hi> Aſſertion. But before I put them to the queſtion, I muſt crave thus much right of you, to grant me this moſt reaſonable poſtulate, that the Doctrine of <hi>Repentance from dead works,</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, was one of the two only things which he preacht, and the Doctrin of <hi>Charity, without which</hi> (the ſame S. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures us that) <hi>the knowledge of all myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and all faith is nothing,</hi> were Doctrins more neceſſary and requiſite, and therefore more fit to be preacht to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> than theſe, <hi>under what Judge our Saviour ſuffered,</hi> that <hi>he was buryed,</hi> and <hi>what time he roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:</hi> which you have taught us, cap. 3. § 2. <hi>for their matter and nature in themſelves not to be Fundamental.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="22">22. And upon this grant, I will ask no leave to conclude, that, whereas you ſay, <hi>the Apostles Creed was intended for a comprehenſion of ſuch heads of faith, as were moſt befitting and requiſite, for preaching the faith of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> You are now, for fear of too much debaſing thoſe high Doctrins of Repentance and Charity, to reſtrain your Aſſertion, as D. <hi>Potter</hi> doth his, and (though you ſpeak indefinitely) to ſay you meant it, only of thoſe heads of Faith, which are <hi>meerly Credenda.</hi> And then the meaning of it (if it have any) muſt be this, That the Creed is full for the Apoſtles intent, which was to comprehend all ſuch general heads of Faith, which being points of <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple belief,</hi> were moſt fit and requiſite to be preached to Jews and Gentiles, and might be briefly and compendiouſly ſet down, and eaſily learned and remembred. Neither I nor you, I believe, can make any other ſenſe of your words then this. And upon this ground thus I ſubſume. But all the points of belief, which were neceſſary, under pain of damnation, for the Apoſtles to preach, and for thoſe to whom the Goſpel was preached, particularly to know and believe, were moſt fit and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, nay more then ſo, neceſſary to be preached to all both Jews and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:64345:107"/>Gentiles, and might be briefly and compendiouſly ſet down, and eaſily learned and remembred: Therefore the Apoſtle's intent by your confeſſion was in this Creed, to comprehend all ſuch points. And you ſay, <hi>The Creed is moſt full and compleat, for the purpoſe which they intended.</hi> The Major of this Syllogiſm is your own. The Minor, I ſhould think, needs no proof, yet becauſe all men may not be of my mind, I will prove it by its parts; and the firſt part thus,</p>
                        <p>There is the ſame neceſſity, for the doing of theſe things; which are commanded to be done, by the ſame Authority, under the ſame pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty.</p>
                        <p>But the ſame Authority, <hi>viz.</hi> Divine, under the ſame penalty, to wit, of damnation, commanded the Apoſtles to preach all theſe Doctrins which we ſpeak of, and thoſe to whom they were preached, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to know and believe them: For we ſpeak of thoſe only, which were ſo commanded, to be preached and believed.</p>
                        <p>Therefore all theſe points were alike neceſſary to be preached to all both Jews and Gentiles.</p>
                        <p>Now that all theſe Doctrins we ſpeak of, may be briefly and compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly ſet down, and eaſily learned and remembred, He that remembers, that we ſpeak only of ſuch Doctrins as are neceſſary to be taught and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will require hereof no farther demonſtration. For, (not to put you in mind of what the Poet ſay, <hi>Non ſunt long a quibus nihil eſt quod demere poſsis,</hi>) who ſees not, that ſeeing the greateſt part of men are of very mean capacities, that it is neceſſary that that may be learned eaſily, which is to be learned of all? What then can hinder me from concluding thus,</p>
                        <p>All the Articles of ſimple belief, which are fit and requiſite to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and may eaſily be remembred, are by your confeſsion comprized in the Creed:</p>
                        <p>But all the neceſſary Articles of Faith are requiſite to be preached, and eaſie to be remembred;</p>
                        <p>Therefore they are all comprized in the Creed:</p>
                        <p>Secondly, from grounds granted by you, I argue thus,</p>
                        <p>Points of belief in themſelves Fundamental, are more requiſite to be preached than thoſe which are not ſo, (this is evident.)</p>
                        <p>But the Apoſtles have put into their Creed ſome Points that are not in in themſelves Fundamental<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo you confeſs, <hi>ubiſupra.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore if they have put in all, moſt requiſite to be preached, they have put in all that in themſelves are Fundamental.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly and laſtly, from your own words, §. 26, thus I conclude for my purpoſe.</p>

                        <p n="23">23. And certainly, he that conſiders the matter adviſedly, either muſt ſay that the Apoſtles were not the Authors of it, or that this was their deſign
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64345:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>in compoſing it, or that they had none at all.

For otherwiſe, inſtead of ſuch general heads, and ſuch Articles, why did not you ſay plainly, All ſuch, or ſome ſuch? This had been plain dealing, but I fear, croſs to your deſign, which yet you have failed of. For that which you have ſpoken (though you are loath to ſpeak out) either ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, or that which I and D. <hi>Potter,</hi> affirm, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Apoſtles Creed contains all thoſe Points of Belief, which were by Gods command, of neceſſity to be preached to all, and believed by all. Neither when I ſay ſo, would I be ſo miſtaken, as if I ſaid, that all points in the Creed are thus neceſſary: For Punies in Logick, know that univerſal affirmatives, are not ſimply converted. And therefore it may be true, that all ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary points, are in the Creed; though it be not true, that all points in the Creed are thus neceſſary: which I willingly grant, of the points by you mentioned. But this rather confirms, than any way invalidates my Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For how could it ſtand with the Apoſtles wiſdom, to put in any points circumſtantial and not neceſſary, and, at the ſame time, to leave out any that were eſſential and neceſſary for that end, which you ſay, they propoſed to themſelves, in making the Creed, that is, <hi>The preaching of the Faith to Jews and Gentiles?</hi>

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though we deſire you, not to grant, that the Creed contains all Points of Faith of all ſorts, any other way than by implication or reduction, no, nor ſo neither; yet you have granted, and muſt grant, of the Fundamental Points of ſimple belief, thoſe which the Apoſtles were commanded in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to teach all men, and all men in particular to know and believe, that theſe are delivered in the Creed, after a more particular and punctual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, than implication or reduction comes to.</p>

Neither is there any diſcord between this Aſſertion of your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, and their holding themſelves obliged to believe all the Points which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> defines. For Proteſtants and Papiſts may both hold, that all Points of Belief neceſſary to be known and believed, are ſummed up in the Creed: and yet both the one and the other think themſelves bound to believe whatſoever other Points they either know, or believe to be revealed by God. For the Articles which are neceſſary to be known that they are revealed by God, may be very few; and yet thoſe which are neceſſary to be believed, when they are revealed and known to be ſo, may be very many.</p>

If this were not ſo, a man might ſet down forty or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the principal Definitions and Diviſions, and Rules of Logick, and call it a Summary or Abſtract of Logick. But ſure, this were no more a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, than that were the picture of a man in little, that wanted any of the parts of a man; or that a total ſum, wherein all the particulars were not caſt up. Now the Apoſtles Creed, you here intimate that it was intended for a Summary; otherwiſe why talk you here of Summaries, and tell us that they need not contain all the particulars of their Science? And of what I pray may it be a Summary, but of the Fundamentals of Chriſtian Faith? Now you have already told us, <hi>That it is moſt full and compleat to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for which it was intended.</hi> Lay all this together, and I believe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct will be, That the Apoſtles Creed is a perfect Summary of the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of the Chriſtian Faith; and what the duty of a perfect Summary is, I have already told you.</p>
                        <p n="32">32. Whereas therefore to diſprove this Aſſertion, in divers particles of this Chapter, but eſpecially the fourteenth, you muſter up whole Armies of Doctrins, which you pretend are neceſſary, and not contained in the Creed; I anſwer, very briefly thus: That the Doctrins you mention, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning matters of practice, and not ſimple Belief; or elſe they are ſuch Doctrins wherein God hath not ſo plainly revealed himſelf, but that honeſt and good men, true Lovers of God and of Truth, thoſe that deſire above all things to know his will and do it, may err, and yet commit no ſin at all, or only a ſin of infirmity, and not deſtructive of Salvation; or laſtly, they are ſuch Doctrins which God hath plainly revealed, and ſo are neceſſary to be believed, when they are known to be divine, but not
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64345:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>neceſſary to be known and believed; not neceſſary to be known for divine, that they may be believed. Now all theſe ſorts of Doctrins are impertinent to the preſent Queſtion. For D. <hi>Potter</hi> never affirmed either that the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary duties of a Chriſtian, or that all Truths piouſly credible, but not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be believed, or that all Truths neceſſary to be believed upon the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of divine Revelation, were ſpecified in the Creed. For this he affirms, only of ſuch ſpeculative divine Verities, which God hath commanded par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to be preached to all, and believed by all. Now let the Doctrins objected by you be well conſidered, and let all thoſe that are reducible to the three former heads be diſcarded; and then of all theſe Inſtances againſt D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s Aſſertion, there will not remain ſo much as one.</p>
                        <p n="33">33. Firſt, the Queſtions touching the conditions to be performed by us to obtain remiſſion of ſins; the Sacraments; the Commandements, and the poſſibility of keeping them: the neceſſity of imploring the Aſſiſtance of Gods Grace and Spirit for the keeping of them: how far obedience is due to the Church: Prayer for the Dead: the ceſſation of the old Law, are all about <hi>Agenda,</hi> and ſo cut off upon the firſt conſideration.</p>
                        <p n="34">34. Secondly the Queſtion touching Fundamentals, is profitable, but not fundamental. He that believes all Fundamentals, cannot be damned for any error in Faith, though he believe more or leſs to be Fundamental than is ſo. That alſo of the proceſſion of the Holy-Ghoſt from the Father and the Son, of Purgatory, of the Churches Viſibility, of the Books of the New-Teſtament, which were doubted of by a conſiderable part of the Primitive Church: (until I ſee better reaſon for the contrary than the bare authority of men) I ſhall eſteem of the ſame condition.</p>
                        <p n="35">35. Thirdly, Theſe Doctrins, That <hi>Adam</hi> and the Angels ſinned: that there are Angels good and bad: that thoſe Books of Scripture which were never doubted of by any conſiderable part of the Church, are the Word of God: that S. <hi>Peter</hi> had no ſuch Primacy as you pretend: that the Scripture is a perfect Rule of Faith, and conſequently that no neceſſary Doctrine is unwritten: that there is no one Society or Succeſſion of Chriſtians abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infallible: Theſe to my underſtanding are Truths plainly revealed by God, and neceſſary to be believed by them who know they are ſo. but not ſo neceſſary, that every man and woman is bound under pain of damnation particularly to know them to be divine Revelations, and explicitely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. And for this reaſon, theſe with innumerable other Points, are to be referred to the third ſort of Doctrins above-mentioned, which were never pretended to have place in the Creed. There remains one only Point of all that Army you muſtered together, reducible to none of theſe heads, and that is, that God is, and is a Remunerator, which you ſay is queſtioned by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal of Merit. But if there were ſuch a neceſſary indiſſoluble coherence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this Point and the Doctrine of merit, me-thinks with as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and more charity you might conclude, That we hold Merit, becauſe we hold this Point; than that we deny this Point, becauſe we deny Merit. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, when Proteſtants deny the Doctrine of Merits, you know right-well, for ſo they have declared themſelves a thouſand times, that they mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but with <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>their well-doing extendeth not is not truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial, to God</hi> with our Saviour <hi>when they have done all which they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, they have done their duty only,</hi> and no curteſie: And laſtly, with S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>all which they can ſuffer for God</hi> (and yet ſuffering is more then
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:64345:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>doing) <hi>is not worthy to be compared to the glory which ſhall be revealed.</hi> So that you muſt either miſunderſtand their meaning in denying Merit, or you muſt diſcharge their Doctrin of this odious conſequence, or you muſt charge it upon <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf. Nay you muſt either grant their denial of true Merit juſt and reaſonable; or you muſt ſay, that our good actions are really profitable to God: that they are not debts already due to him, but voluntary and undeſerved Favours: and that they are equal unto and well worthy of eternal glory which is prepared for them. As for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience which you ſo much fear, That the denial of Merit makes God a Giver only, and not a Rewarder; I tell you, good Sir, you fear where no fear is: And that it is both moſt true on the one ſide, that you in holding good Works meritorious of eternal glory make God a Rewarder only and not a Giver, contrary to plain Scripture, affirming that <hi>The gift of God is eternal life;</hi> And that it is moſt falſe on the other ſide, that the Doctrin of Proteſtants makes God a Giver only and not a Rewarder; In as much as their Doctrin is, That God gives not Heaven but to thoſe which do ſomething for it, and ſo his Gift is alſo a Reward; but withal, that whatſoever they do is due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God before-hand, and worth nothing to God, &amp; worth nothing in reſpect of Heaven, and ſo mans work is no Merit, and Gods Reward is ſtill a Gift.</p>
                        <p n="36">36. Put the caſe the Pope, for a reward of your ſervice done him in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Book, had given you the honor and means of a Cardinal, would you not, not only in humility, but in ſincerity have profeſſed, that you had not merited ſuch a Reward? And yet the Pope is neither your Creator, nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, nor Preſerver, nor perhaps your very great Benefactor; ſure I am, not ſo great as God Almighty, and therefore hath no ſuch right and title to your ſervice as God hath in reſpect of precedent Obligations. Beſides, the work you have done him hath been really advantagious to him: and laſtly not altogether unproportionable to the fore-mentioned Reward. And therefore if by the ſame work you will pretend that either you have or hope to have deſerved immortal happineſs, I beſeech you conſider well whether this be not to ſet a higher value upon a Cardinals cap, than a Crown of immortal glory, and with that Cardinal to prefer a part in <hi>Paris,</hi> before a part in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>

                        <p n="37">37. In the next Paragraph you beat the air again, and fight manfully with your own ſhadow. The Point you ſhould have ſpoken to, was this, That there are ſome Points of ſimple belief neceſſary to be explicitely believed, which yet are not contained in the Creed. Inſtead hereof you trouble your ſelf in vain to demonſtrate, That <hi>many important Points of Faith are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it,</hi> which yet D. <hi>Potter</hi> had freely granted, and you your ſelf take particular notice of his granting of it. All this pains therefore you have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to no purpoſe; ſaving that to ſome negligent Reader you may ſeem to have ſpoken to the very Point, becauſe that which you ſpeak to, at the firſt hearing, ſounds ſomewhat near it. But ſuch a one I muſt intreat to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, there be many more Points of Faith, than there be Articles of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple belief, neceſſary to be explicitely believed: And that though all of the former ſort are not contained in the Creed, yet all of the latter ſort may be. As for your Diſtinction between Hereſies that have been, and Hereſies that are, and Hereſies that may be, I have already proved it vain; and that whatſoever may be an Hereſie, that is ſo; and whatſoever is ſo, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes hath been ſo, ever ſince the publication of the Goſpel of Chriſt.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:64345:110"/>The Doctrine of your Church may like a Snow-ball increaſe with rowling, and again, if you pleaſe, melt away and decreaſe: But as <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> ſo his Goſpel, <hi>is yeſterday, and today, and the ſame for ever.</hi>

If your Church have any larger, or if ſhe have a Commiſſion at large, to teach what ſhe pleaſeth, and call it the Goſpel of Chriſt, let her produce her Letters-patents from heaven for it. But if this be all you have, then muſt you give me leave to eſteem it both great ſacriledge in you to forbid any thing, be it never ſo ſmall or ceremonious, which Chriſt hath commanded; as the receiving of the Communion in both kinds: and as high a degree of preſumption, to enjoyn men to believe, that there are or can be any other Fundamental Articles of the Goſpel of Chriſt, then what Chriſt himſelf commanded his Apoſtles to teach all men; or any damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, but ſuch as are plainly repugnant to theſe prime Verities.</p>

The ſaying of the moſt learned Prelate, and excellent man, the <hi>Arch-Biſhop of Armach,</hi> is only related by D. <hi>Potter,</hi> p. 155. and not applauded: though the truth is, both the Man deſerves as much applauſe as any man, and his ſaying as much as any ſaying; it being as great, and as good a Truth, and as neceſſary for theſe miſerable times, as poſſibly can be uttered. For this is moſt certain, and I believe you will eaſily grant it, that to reduce Chriſtians to Unity of Communion, there are but two ways that may be conceived probable: The one by taking away diverſity of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions touching matters of Religion: The other, by ſhewing that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Opinions, which is among the ſeveral Sects of Chriſtians, ought to be no hinderance to their Unity in Communion.</p>
                        <p n="40">40. Now the former of theſe is not to be hoped for without a miracle, unleſs that could be done, which is impoſſible to be performed, though it be often pretended; that is, unleſs it could be made evident to all men, that God hath appointed ſome viſible Judge of Controverſies, to whoſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all men are to ſubmit themſelves. What then remains, but that the other way muſt be taken, &amp; Chriſtians muſt be taught to ſet a higher value upon theſe high Points of Faith and Obedience wherein they agree, than upon theſe matters of leſs moment wherein they differ; and underſtand, that agreement in thoſe, ought to be more effectual to joyn them in one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, than their difference in other things of leſs moment to divide them? When I ſay, <hi>in one Communion,</hi> I mean, in a common Profeſſion of thoſe Articles of Faith, wherein all conſent: A joynt-worſhip of God, after ſuch a way as all eſteem lawful; and a mutual performance of all thoſe works of Charity, which Chriſtians owe one to another. And to ſuch a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion what better inducement could be thought of, than to demonſtrate that what was univerſally believed of al Chriſtians, if it were joyned with a love of truth, and with holy obedience, was ſufficient to bring men to heaven? For why ſhould men be more rigid then God? Why ſhould any error ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any man from the Churches Communion, which will not deprive him of eternal Salvation? Now that Chriſtians do generally agree in all thoſe Points of Doctrin, which are neceſſary to Salvation, it is apparent, becauſe they agree with one accord in believing all thoſe Books of the Old &amp; New
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:64345:111"/>Teſtament, which in the Church were never doubted of to be the undoubted Word of God. And it is ſo certain that in all theſe Books, all neceſſary Doctrins are evidently contained, that of all the four Evangeliſts this is very probable, but of S. <hi>Luke</hi> moſt apparent, that in every one of their Books they have comprehended the whole ſubſtance of the Goſpel of Chriſt. For what reaſon can be imagined, that any of them ſhould leave out any thing which he knew to be neceſſary, and yet (as apparently all of them have done) put in many things which they knew to be only profitable and not neceſſary? What wiſe and honeſt man that were now to write the Goſpel of Chriſt, would do ſo great a work of God after ſuch a negligent faſhion? Suppoſe <hi>Xaverius</hi> had been to write the Goſpel of Chriſt for the <hi>Indians,</hi> think you he would have left out any Fundamental Doctrin of it? If not, I muſt beſeech you to conceive as well of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and S. <hi>Mark,</hi> and S. <hi>Luke,</hi> and S. <hi>John,</hi> as you do of <hi>Xaverius.</hi> Beſides, if every one of them have not in them all neceſſary Doctrins, how have they complyed with their own deſign, which was, as the Titles of their Books ſhew, to write <hi>the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> and not a part of it? Or how have they not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us, in giving them ſuch Titles? By the whole Goſpel of Chriſt, I underſtand not the whole Hiſtory of Chriſt, but all that makes up the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant between God and man. Now if this be wholly contained in the Goſpel of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> and S. <hi>John,</hi> I believe every conſidering man will be inclinable to believe that then without doubt, it is contained, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of many other profitable things, in the larger Goſpels of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and S. <hi>Luke.</hi> And that S. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Goſpel wants no neceſſary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of this Covenant, I preſume you will not deny, if you believe <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> when he ſays, Matthew <hi>to the Hebrews in their tongue publiſhed the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Goſpel: When</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>did preach the Goſpel, and found the Church, or a Church at</hi> Rome, <hi>or of</hi> Rome, <hi>and after their departure</hi> Mark <hi>the ſcholar of</hi> Peter, <hi>delivered to us in writing thoſe things which had been preached by</hi> Peter; <hi>and</hi> Luke, <hi>and the follower of</hi> Paul, <hi>compiled in a Book the Goſpel which was preached by him: And afterwards</hi> John, <hi>reſiding in</hi> Aſia, <hi>in the City of</hi> Epheſus, <hi>did himſelf alſo ſet forth a Goſpel.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="41">41. In which words of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> it is remarkable that they are ſpoken by him againſt ſome Heretiques, that pretended (as you know who do now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days) that <hi>ſome neceſſary Doctrins of the Goſpel were unwritten,</hi> and that <hi>out of the Scriptures, truth</hi> (he muſt mean ſufficient truth,) <hi>cannot be found by thoſe which know not Tradition.</hi> Againſt whom to ſay, that part of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel which was preached by <hi>Peter,</hi> was written by S. <hi>Mark,</hi> and ſome other neceſſary parts of it omitted, had been to ſpeak impertinently, and rather to confirm than confute their error. It is plain therefore, that he muſt mean, as I pretend, that all the neceſſary Doctrine of the Goſpel which was preached by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> was written by S. <hi>Mark.</hi> Now you will not deny, I preſume, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> preached all, therefore you muſt not deny that S. <hi>Mark</hi> wrote all.</p>
                        <p n="42">42. Our next inquiry let it be touching S. <hi>John</hi>'s intent in writing his Goſpel, whether it were to deliver ſo much truth, as being believed and obeyed would certainly bring men to eternal life, or only part of it, and to leave part unwritten? A great man there is, but much leſs than the Apoſtle, who ſaith, that <hi>writing laſt, he purpoſed to ſupply the defects of the other Evangeliſts that had wrote before him:</hi> which (if it were true) would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:64345:111"/>juſtifie what I have undertaken, that at leaſt all the four Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts have in them, all the neceſſary parts of the Goſpel of Chriſt. Neither will I deny, but S. <hi>John</hi>'s ſecondary intent might be to ſupply the defects of the former three Goſpels, in ſome things very profitable. But he that pretends, that any neceſſary Doctrine is in S. <hi>John,</hi> which is in none of the other Evangeliſts, hath not ſo well conſidered them as he ſhould do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he pronounce ſentence of ſo weighty a matter. And for his prime in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in writing his Goſpel, what that was, certainly no Father in the world underſtood it better than himſelf. Therefore let us hear him ſpeak: <hi>Many other ſigns</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>alſo did Jeſus in the ſight of his Diſciples, which are not written in this Book: But theſe are written, that you may believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his Name.</hi> By <hi>(theſe are written)</hi> may be underſtood either <hi>theſe things</hi> are written, or <hi>theſe ſigns</hi> are written. Take it which way you will, this concluſion will certainly follow, That either all that which S. <hi>John</hi> wrote in his Goſpel, or leſs then all, and therefore all much more was ſufficient to make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that, which being believed with lively faith, would certainly bring them to eternal life.</p>
                        <p n="43">43. This which hath been ſpoken (I hope) is enough to juſtifie my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to the full, that it is very probable that every one of the four E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts hath in his Book the whole ſubſtance, all the neceſſary parts of the Goſpel of Chriſt. But for S. <hi>Luke,</hi> that he hath written ſuch a perfect Goſpel, in my judgment, it ought to be with them that believe him, no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of queſtion. Conſider firſt the introduction to his Goſpel, where he declares what he intends to write, in theſe words, <hi>For as much as many have taken in hand to ſet forth in order a declaration of thoſe things, which are moſt ſurely believed amongſt us, even as they delivered unto us, which from the beginning were eye-witneſſes, and Miniſters of the Word, it ſeemed good to me alſo, having had perfect underſtanding of things from the firſt, to write to thee in order, moſt excellent</hi> Theophilus, <hi>that thou mighteſt know the certainty of thoſe things wherein thou haſt been inſtructed.</hi> Add to this place, the entrance to his <hi>Hiſtory of the Acts of the Apoſtles: The former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe have I made, O</hi> Theophilus, <hi>of all that Jeſus began both to do and teach, until the day in which he was taken up.</hi> Weigh well theſe two places and then anſwer me freely and ingenuouſly to theſe demands.

When you have well conſidered theſe propoſals, I believe you will be very apt to think (if S. <hi>Luke</hi> be of credit with you) That all things neceſſary to ſalvation, are certainly contained in his writings alone.</item>
                           </list> And from hence you will not chuſe but conclude, that ſeeing all the Chriſtians in the world, agree in the belief of what S. <hi>Luke</hi> hath written, and not only ſo, but in all other Books of Canonical Scripture, which were never doubted of, in and by the Church, the Learned Arch-Biſhop had very juſt and certain ground to ſay, <hi>That in theſe Propoſitions, which without Controverſie are univerſally received in the whole Chriſtian world, ſo much truth is contained, as, being joyned with holy obedience, may be ſufficient to bring a man to everlaſting Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and that we have no cauſe to doubt, but that, as many as walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this rule, neither overthrowing that which they have builded, by ſuperinducing any damnable Hereſie thereupon, nor otherwiſe vitiating their holy Faith, with a lewd and wicked converſation, peace ſhall be upon them, and upon the Iſrael of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="44">44. Againſt this, you object two things. The one, that by this Rule, <hi>Seeing the Doctrin of the Trinity is not received univerſally among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the denial of it ſhall not exclude Salvation.</hi> The other; that <hi>the Biſhop contradicts himſelf, in ſuppoſing a man may believe all neceſſary Truths, and yet ſuperinduce ſome damnable Hereſies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="45">45. To the firſt I anſwer, what I conceive he would, whoſe words I here juſtifie, that he hath declared plainly in this very place, that he meant, not an abſolute, but a limited Univerſality, and ſpeaks not of propoſitions univerſally believed by all Profeſſions of Chriſtianity that are, but only, by all thoſe ſeveral Profeſſions of Chriſtianity that have any large ſpread in any part of the world. By which words be excludes from the univerſality here ſpoken of, the deniers of the Doctrin of the Trinity, as being but a handful of men, in reſpect of all, nay in reſpect of any of theſe Profeſſions which maintain it. And therefore it was a great fault in you, either willingly to conceal theſe words, which evacuate your Objection, or elſe negligently to overſee them. Eſpecially ſeeing your friend, to whom you are ſo much beholding, <hi>Paulus Veridicus,</hi> in his ſcurrilous and ſophiſtical Pamphler, againſt B. <hi>Uſher</hi>'s Sermon, hath ſo kindly offered to lead you by the hand to the obſervation of them, in theſe words: <hi>To conſider of your</hi> Coinopiſta, <hi>or</hi> communiter Credenda, <hi>Articles, as you call them, univerſally believed of all theſe ſeveral Profeſsions of Chriſtianity, which have any large ſpread in the World: Theſe Articles for example, may be the Unity of the Godhead, the Trinity of Perſons, the immortality of the Soul,</hi> &amp;c. Where you ſee that your friend, whom you ſo much magnifie, hath plainly confeſſed, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Biſhop's words, the denial of the Doctrin of the Trinity may exclude Salvation; and therefore in approving and applauding his Anſwer to the Biſhop's Sermon, you have unawares allowed this Anſwer of mine to your own greateſt Objection.</p>
                        <p n="46">46. Now for the foul contradiction, which you ſay the <hi>Doctor</hi> might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily have eſpyed in the Biſhop's ſaying, he deſires your pardon for his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:64345:112"/>ſight, for <hi>Paulus Veridicus</hi> his ſake; who though he ſet himſelf to find faults with the Biſhop's Sermon, yet it ſeems this he could not find, or elſe queſtionleſs we ſhould have heard of it from him. And therefore, if D. <hi>Potter,</hi> being the Biſhop's friend, have not been more ſharp-ſighted than his enemies, this, he hopes, to indifferent Judges will ſeem no unpardonable offence. Yet this I ſay, not as if there were any contradiction at all, much leſs any foul contradiction, in the Biſhop's words; but as <hi>Antipheron</hi>'s picture, which he thought he ſaw in the air before him, was not in the air but in his diſturbed phanſie: ſo all the contradiction which here you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcant upon, is not indeed in the Biſhop's ſaying, but in your imagination. For wherein, I pray, lies this foul contradiction? <hi>In ſuppoſing</hi> (ſay you) <hi>a man may believe all Truths neceſſary to ſalvation, and yet ſuperinduce a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Hereſie.</hi> I anſwer, It is not certain that his words do ſuppoſe this: neither, if they do, doth he contradict himſelf. I ſay, it is not certain that his words import any ſuch matter. For ordinarily men uſe to ſpeak and write ſo, as here he doth, when they intend not to limit or reſtrain, but only to repeat, and preſs, and illuſtrate what they have ſaid before. And I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, why with your Eagles eyes you did not eſpy another foul contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his words as well as this; and ſay, that he ſuppoſes a man may walk according to the rule of holy obedience, and yet vitiate his holy Faith with a lewd and wicked Converſation? Certainly, a lewd Converſation is altogether as contradictious to holy Obedience, as a damnable Hereſie to neceſſary Truth. What then was the reaſon that you eſpyed not this foul contradiction in his words as well as that? Was it becauſe, according to the Spirit and Genius of your Church, your zeal is greater to that which you conceive true doctrin, than holy obedience; and think ſimple error a more capital crime than ſins committed againſt knowledge and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Or was it becauſe your Reaſon told you, that herein he meant only to repeat and not to limit what he ſaid before? And why then had you not ſo much candour to conceive that he might have the ſame meaning in the former part of the disjunction; and intend no more but this, Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever walks according to this rule of believing all neceſſary Truths and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Obedience, (neither poyſoning his faith of thoſe Truths which he holds, with the mixture of any damnable Hereſie, nor vitiating it with a wicked life) Peace ſhall be upon him! In which words what man of any ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will not preſently perceive that the words within the parentheſis, are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a repetition of, and no exception from, thoſe that are without? S. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi> in his Creed tels us, <hi>The Catholique Faith is this, that we worſhip one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, neither confounding the Perſons, nor dividing the Subſtance;</hi> and why now do you not tell him that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts himſelf, and ſuppoſes that we may worſhip a Trinity of Perſons, and one God in ſubſtance, and yet confound the Perſons, or divide the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: which yet is impoſſible, becauſe Three remaining Three, cannot be confounded, and One remaining One cannot be divided? If a man ſhould ſay unto you, he that keeps all the Commandments of God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting no ſin either againſt the love of God, or the love of his neighbour, is a perfect man: Or thus, he that will live in conſtant health had need be exact in his dyet, neither eating too much, nor too little: Or thus, he that will come to <hi>London,</hi> muſt go on ſtraight forward in ſuch a way, and neither turn to the right hand or to the left; I verily believe you would not
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64345:113"/>find any contradiction in his words, but confeſs them as coherent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonant as any in your Book. And certainly, if you would look upon this ſaying of the Biſhop with any indifference, you would eaſily perceive it to be of the very ſame kind, and capable of the very ſame conſtruction. And therefore one of the grounds of your accuſation is uncertain. Neither can you aſſure us, that the Biſhop ſuppoſes any ſuch matter as you pretend. Neither, if he did ſuppoſe this (as perhaps he did) were this to contradict himſelf. For though there can be no damnable Hereſie, unleſs it contradict ſome neceſſary Truth, yet there is no contradiction but the ſame man may at once believe this Hereſie and this Truth; becauſe there is no contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the ſame man, at the ſame time, ſhould believe contradictions. For firſt, whatſoever a man believes true, that he may and muſt believe; But there have been ſome who have believed and taught that contradictions might be true, againſt whom <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> diſputes in the third of his <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicks;</hi> Therefore it is not impoſſible that a man may believe Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. Secondly, they which believe there is no certainty in Reaſon, muſt believe that contradictions may be true: For otherwiſe there will be certainty in this Reaſon; This contradicts Truth, therefore it is falſe. But there be now divers in the world, who believe there is no certainty in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, (and whether you be of their mind or no, I deſire to be informed;) Therefore there be divers in the world who believe contradictions may be true. Thirdly, They which do captivate their underſtandings to the belief of thoſe things which to their underſtanding ſeem irreconcileable contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, may as well believe real contradictions: (For the difficulty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ariſes not from their being repugnant, but from their ſeeming to be ſo:) But you do captivate your underſtandings to the belief of thoſe things which ſeem to your underſtandings irreconcileable contradictions; Therefore it is as poſsible and eaſie for you to believe thoſe that indeed are ſo. Fourthly, ſome men may be confuted in their errors, and perſwaded out of them; but no mans error can be confuted, who together with his error doth not believe and grant ſome true Principle that contradicts his Error: for nothing can be proved to him who grants nothing, neither can there be (as all men know) any rational diſcourſe but out of grounds agreed upon by both parts. Therefore it is not impoſsible but abſolutely certain, that the ſame man at the ſame time may believe contradictions. Fifthly, It is evident, neither can you without extream madneſs and uncharitableneſs, deny that we believe the Bible, thoſe Books, I mean, which we account Canonical: Otherwiſe why diſpute you with us out of them, as out of a common Principle? Either therefore you muſt retract your opinion, and acknowledge that the ſame man at the ſame time may believe contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or elſe you will run into a greater inconvenience, and be forced to confeſs, that no part of our Doctrine contradicts the Bible. Sixthly, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to vindicate from contradiction theſe following Aſſertions: That there ſhould be Length and nothing long: Breadth, and nothing broad: Thickneſs, and nothing thick: Whiteneſs, and nothing white: Roundneſs, and nothing round: Weight, and nothing heavy: Sweetneſs, and nothing ſweet: Moiſture, and nothing moiſt: Fluidneſs, and nothing flowing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many Actions, and no Agent: many Paſsions, and no Patient: That is, that there ſhould be a long, broad, thick, white, round, heavy, ſweet moiſt, flowing, active, paſsive Nothing! That Bread ſhould be turned into the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:64345:113"/>ſubſtance of Chriſt, and yet not any thing of the Bread become any thing of Chriſt; neither the matter, nor the form, nor the Accidents of Bread, be made either the matter, or the Form, or the Accidents of Chriſt. That Bread ſhould be turned into nothing, and at the ſame time with the ſame action turned into Chriſt, and yet Chriſt ſhould not be nothing. That the ſame thing at the ſame time ſhould have its juſt dimenſions, and juſt diſtance of its parts, one from another, and at the ſame time not have it, but all its parts together in one and the ſelf ſame point. That the body of Chriſt, which is much greater, ſhould be contained wholly and in its full dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without any alteration, in that which is leſſer, and that not once only, but as many times over as there are ſeveral points in the Bread and Wine. That the ſame thing at the ſame time ſhould be wholly above it ſelf, and wholly below it ſelf, within it ſelf, and without it ſelf, on the right hand, and on the left hand, and round about it ſelf. That the ſame thing at the ſame time ſhould move to and from it ſelf, and lie ſtill: Or that it ſhould be carried from one place to another through the middle ſpace, and yet not move. That it ſhould be brought from heaven to earth, and yet not come out of Heaven, nor be at all in any of the middle ſpaces between Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth. That to be one, ſhould be to be undivided from it ſelf, and yet that one and the ſame thing ſhould be divided from it ſelf. That a thing may be, and yet be no where. That a Finite thing may be in all places at once. That a Body may be in a place, and have there its dimenſions, and colour, and all other qualities, and yet that it is not in the power of God to make it viſible, and tangible there, nor capable of doing or ſuffering any thing. That there ſhould be no certainty in our ſenſes, and yet that we ſhould know ſomething certainly, and yet know nothing but by our ſenſes. That that which is, and was long ago, ſhould now begin to be. That that is now to be made of nothing, which is not nothing but ſomething. That the ſame thing ſhould be before and after it ſelf. That it ſhould be truly and really in a place, and yet without Locality. Nay, that he which is, Omnipotent, ſhould not be able to give it Locality in this place, where it is, as ſome of you hold: Or, if he can, as others ſay he can, that it ſhould be poſſible, that the ſame man, for example, You or I, may at the ſame time, be awake at <hi>London,</hi> and not awake but aſleep at <hi>Rome:</hi> There run or walk, here not run or walk, but ſtand ſtill, ſit, or lie along: There ſtudy or write; here, do neither, but dine or ſup: There ſpeak, here be ſilent. That he may in one place freeze for cold, in another place burn with heat. That he may be drunk in one place, and ſober in another: Valiant in one place, and a Coward in another: A Thief in one place, and honeſt in another. That he may be a Papiſt, and go to Maſs in <hi>Rome;</hi> A Proteſtant and go to Church in <hi>England.</hi> That he may die in <hi>Rome,</hi> and live in <hi>England:</hi> or dying in both places may go to Hell from <hi>Rome,</hi> and to Heaven from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> That the Body and Soul of Chriſt ſhould ceaſe to be where it was, and yet not go to another place, nor be deſtroyed. All theſe, and many other of the like nature are the unavoidable, and moſt of them the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Conſequences of your Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation, as is explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one way or other by your School-men. Now I beſeech you, Sir, to try your skill, and, if you can compoſe their repugnance. and make peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, certainly, none but you ſhall be <hi>Catholique Moderator.</hi> But if you cannot do it, and that after an intelligible manner, then you muſt give
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:64345:114"/>me leave to believe, that either you do not believe Tranſubſtantiation, or elſe, that it is no contradiction, that men ſhould ſubjugate their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the belief of contradictions.</p>
                        <p n="47">47. Laſtly, I pray tell me whether you have not ſo much Charity in ſtore for the <hi>Biſhop of Armach,</hi> and D. <hi>Porter,</hi> as to think that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves believe this ſaying, which the one preacht and printed, the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, and, as you ſay, applauded? If you think they do, then certainly, you have done unadviſedly, either in charging it with a foul contradiction, or, in ſaying, it is impoſſible, that any man ſhould at once believe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. Indeed that men ſhould not aſſent to contradictions, and that it is unreaſonable to do ſo, I willingly grant: But to ſay, it is impoſſible to be done, is againſt every mans experience, and almoſt as unreaſonable, as to do the thing which is ſaid to be impoſſible. For though perhaps it may be very difficult for a man in his right wits to believe a contradiction ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in terms; eſpecially if he believe it to be a contradiction, yet for men being cowed and awed by ſuperſtition, to perſwade themſelves upon ſlight and trivial grounds, that theſe or theſe, though they ſeem contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, yet indeed are not ſo, and ſo to believe them: or if the plain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance of them, be veiled or diſguiſed a little, with ſome empty unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible non-ſenſe diſtinction; or if it be not expreſt but implyed, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect but by conſequence, ſo that the parties, to whoſe faith the propoſitions are offered, are either innocently, or perhaps affectedly ignorant of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of them: for men in ſuch caſes, eaſily to ſwallow and digeſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, he that denies it poſſible, muſt be a meer ſtranger in the world.</p>
                        <p n="48">48. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 18. This Paragraph conſiſts of two immodeſt Untruths, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded upon us without ſhew, or ſhadow, of Reaſon: and an evident So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſm, grounded upon an affected miſtake of the ſenſe of the word <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="49">49. The firſt Untruth is, that D. <hi>Potter makes a Church, of men agreeing ſcarcely in one Point of Faith: of men concurring in ſome one or few Articles of Belief, and in the reſt holding conceits plainly contradictory: Agreeing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this one Article, that Chriſt is our Saviour; but for the reſt, like to the parts of a Chimaera,</hi> &amp;c. Which I ſay is a ſhameleſs calumny, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe D. <hi>Potter</hi> in this Point delivers not his own judgment, but relates the opinion of others, M. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and M. <hi>Morton;</hi> but eſpecially, becauſe even theſe men (as they are related by D. <hi>Potter</hi>) to the conſtituting of the very Eſſence of a Church, in the loweſt degree, require not only <hi>Faith in Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God and Saviour of the World,</hi> but alſo <hi>ſubmiſsion to his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin in mind and will.</hi> Now I beſeech you Sir, tell me ingenuouſly, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Doctrin of Chriſt may be called without blaſphemy, <hi>ſcarcely one Point of Faith?</hi> or whether it conſiſts only, <hi>of ſome one or few Articles of Belief?</hi> Or whether there be nothing in it, but only this Article, <hi>That Chriſt is our Saviour?</hi> Is it not manifeſt to all the world, that Chriſtians of all Profeſsions do agree with one conſent, in the belief of all thoſe Books of Scripture, which were not doubted of in the Ancient Church without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of damnation? Nay, is it not apparent that no man at this time, can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hypocriſie, pretend to believe in Chriſt, but of neceſsity he muſt do ſo? Seeing he can have no reaſon to believe in Chriſt, but he muſt have the ſame to believe the Scripture. I pray then read over the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture once more, or, if that be too much labour, the New Teſtament
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64345:114"/>only; and then ſay, whether there be nothing there, but <hi>ſcarcely one Point of Faith? But ſome one or two Articles of Belief? Nothing but this Article only, That Chriſt is our Saviour?</hi> Say, whether there be not there an infinite number of Divine Verities, Divine Preecepts, Divine Promiſes, and thoſe ſo plainly and undoubtedly delivered, that if any ſees them not, it cannot be becauſe he cannot, but becauſe he will not! So plainly, that whoſoever ſubmits ſincerely to the Doctrin of Chriſt, in mind and will, cannot poſſibly but ſubmit to theſe in act and performance. And in the reſt, which it hath pleaſed God, for reaſons beſt known to himſelf, to deliver obſcurely or ambiguouſly, yet thus far at leaſt they agree, that the ſenſe of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by God, is certainly true, and that they are without paſſion or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to endeavour to find it out: The difference only is, Which is that true ſenſe which God intended. Neither would this long continue, if the walls of ſeparation, whereby the Devil hopes to make their Diviſions e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, were pulled down; and error were not ſupported againſt Truth, by humane advantages? But for the preſent, God forbid the matter ſhould be ſo ill as you make it! For whereas you looking upon their Points of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and agreement, through I know not what ſtrange glaſſes, have made the firſt innumerable, and the other ſcarſe a number: the truth is clean contrary; That thoſe Divine Verities Speculative and Practical, wherein they univerſally agree (which you will have to be but a few, or but one, or ſcarcely one) amount to <hi>many millions,</hi> (if an exact account were taken of them:) And on the other ſide, the Points in variance, are in compariſon but few, and thoſe not of ſuch a quality, but the Error in them may well conſiſt with the belief and obedience of the entire Covenant, ratified by Chriſt between God and man. Yet I would not be ſo miſtaken, as if I thought the errors even of ſome Proteſtants unconſiderable things, and matters of no moment. For the truth is, I am very fearful, that ſome of their opinions, either as they are, or as they are apt to be miſtaken, (though not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo damnable, but that good and holy men may be ſaved with them, yet) are too frequent occaſions of our remiſneſs, and ſlackneſs, in running the race of Chriſtian Profeſſion, of our deferring Repentance, and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to God, of our frequent relapſes into ſin, and not ſeldom of ſecurity in ſinning; &amp; conſequently, though not certain cauſes, yet too frequent occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of many mens damnation: and ſuch I conceive all theſe Doctrins, which either directly or obliquely, put men in hope of eternal happineſs, by any other means ſaving only the narrow way <hi>of ſincere and univerſal obedience,</hi> grounded upon a true and lively Faith. Theſe errors therefore, I do not elevate or extenuate: an<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="50">50. Your other palpable untruth is, that <hi>Proteſtants are far more bold to diſagree even in matters of Faith, than Catholique Divines</hi> (you mean your own) <hi>in Queſtions meerly Philoſophical, or not determined by the Church.</hi> For neither do they differ at all, in <hi>matters of Faith,</hi> if you take the word in the higheſt ſenſe, and mean, by matters of Faith, ſuch Doctrins as are

                           <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> to Salvation to be believed, or not to be dis-believed. And then in thoſe wherein they do differ, with what colour or ſhadow of Argument, can you make good, that <hi>they are more bold to diſagree, than you are in Queſtions meerly Philoſophical, or not determined by the Church?</hi> For is there not as great repugnancy between your aſſent and diſſent, your affirmation and negation, your <hi>Eſt Eſt, Non Non,</hi> as there is between theirs? You follow your Reaſon, in thoſe things which are not determined by your Church; and they theirs, in things not plainly determined in Scripture. And wherein then conſiſts their greater, <hi>their far greater boldneſs?</hi> And what if they in their contradictory opinions, pretend both to relie upon the truth of God, doth this make their contradictions ever a whit the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant? I had always thought, that all contradictions had been equally contradictions, and equally repugnant; becauſe the leaſt of them are as far aſunder as <hi>Eſt</hi> and <hi>Non eſt</hi> can make them, and the greateſt are no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But then you in your differences, (by name, about Predetermination, the Immaculate Conception, the Pope's Infallibility) upon what other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive do you relie? Do not you cite Scripture, or Tradition, or both, on both ſides? And do you not pretend, that both theſe are the infallible Truths of Almighty God?</p>
                        <p n="51">51. You cloſe up this Section with a fallacy, proving forſooth, that <hi>we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, by our confeſsion, the Church which is the houſe of God, becauſe we ſtand only upon Fundamental Articles, which cannot make up the whole fabrick of the Faith, no more than the foundation of a houſe alone can be a houſe.</hi>

                        <p n="52">52. But I hope, Sir, you will not be difficult in granting, that that is a houſe which hath all the neceſſary parts belonging to a houſe: Now by Fundamental Articles, we mean all thoſe which are neceſſary. And you your ſelf, in the very leaf after this, take notice that D. <hi>Potter</hi> doth ſo. Where to this Queſtion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How ſhall I know in particular which Points be, and which be not Fundamental?

                        <p n="53">53. <hi>Ad</hi> § 19. This long diſcourſe, ſo full of un-ingenuous dealing with your adverſary, perhaps would have done reaſonably in a Farce or a Comedy, and I doubt not but you have made your ſelf and your courteous Readers good ſport with it. But if D. <hi>Potter,</hi> or I, had been by, when you wrote it, we ſhould have ſtopt your carere at the firſt ſtarting, and have put you in mind of theſe old School-Proverbs, <hi>Ex falſo ſuppoſito ſequitur quodlibet,</hi> and <hi>Uno abſurdo dato, ſequuntur mille.</hi> For whereas you ſuppoſe, firſt, that to a man deſirous to ſave his ſoul, and requiring, whoſe direction he might rely upon? the Doctors anſwer would be, <hi>Upon the truly Catholick Church,</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:64345:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>upon better reaſon, becauſe I know his mind, that he would adviſe him to call <hi>no man Maſter on Earth,</hi> but, according to Chriſts command, to rely upon the direction of God himſelf. If he ſhould enquire, where he ſhould find this direction? He would anſwer him; In his Word contained in Scripture. If he ſhould enquire what aſſurance he might have, that the Scripture is the Word of God? He would anſwer him, that the doctrin it ſelf is very fit and worthy to be thought to come from God, <hi>nec vox hominem ſonat,</hi> and that they which wrote and delivered it, confirmed it to be the Word of God by doing ſuch works as could not be done, but by power from God himſelf. For aſſurance of the Truth hereof he would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe him to rely upon that, which all wiſe men in all matters of belief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon; and that is the conſent of Ancient Records, and Univerſal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. And that he might not inſtruct him as partial in this advice, he might farther tell him, that a Gentleman that would be nameleſs, that has written a Book againſt him, called <hi>Charity maintained by Catholiques,</hi> though in many things he differ from him, yet agrees with him in this, that <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſuch a principle as may be reſted in, and which requires no other proof.</hi> As indeed no wiſe man doubts but there was ſuch a man as <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> or <hi>Cicero,</hi> that there are ſuch Cities as <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> though he have no other aſſurance for the one or the other, but only the <hi>ſpeech</hi> of people. This tradition therefore he would counſel him to rely upon, and to believe that the Book which we call Scripture, was confirmed abundantly by the works of God, to be the Word of God. Believing it the Word of God, he muſt of neceſſity believe it true: and if he believe it true, he muſt believe it contains all neceſſary direction to eternal happineſs, becauſe it affirms it ſelf to do ſo. Nay, he might tell him that ſo far is the whole Book, from wanting any neceſſary direction to his eternal Salvation, that one only Author, that hath writ but too little Books of it, S. <hi>Luke</hi> by name, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and in the beginning of his <hi>Story,</hi> ſhews plainly that he alone hath written at leaſt ſo much as is neceſſary. And what they wrote, they wrote by Gods direction, for the direction of the world, not only for the Learned, but for all that would do their true endeavour to know the will of God, and to do it; therefore you cannot but conceive, that writing to all and for all, they wrote ſo as that in things neceſſary they might be underſtood by all. Beſides that, here he ſhould find, that God himſelf has engaged himſelf by promiſe, that if he would love him, and keep his Commandements and pray earneſtly for his Spirit, and be willing to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by it, he ſhould undoubtedly receive it, even the <hi>Spirit of Truth which ſhall lead him into all truth;</hi> that is certainly, at leaſt into all neceſſary Truths, and ſuffer him to fal into no pernicious error. The ſum of his whole directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him briefly would be this, believe the Scripture to be the Word of God, uſe your true endeavour to find the true ſenſe of it, and to live according to it, and then you may reſt ſecurely that you are in the true way to eternal happineſs. This is the ſubſtance of that Anſwer which the Doctor would make to any man in this caſe; and this is a way ſo plain, that fools, unleſs they will, cannot err from it. Becauſe, not knowing abſolutely all truth, nay not all profitable truth, and being feee from err our; but endeavouring to know the truth and obey it, and endeavouring to be free from err our, is by this way made the only condition of Salvation. As for your ſuppoſition That he would adviſe ſuch a man to rely upon the Catholique Church for
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:64345:116"/>the finding out the doctrin of Chriſt; he utterly diſclaims it, and truly very juſtly: There being no certain way to know that any Company is a true Church, but only by their profeſſing the true doctrin of Chriſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as it is impoſſible I ſhould know that ſuch a company of Philoſophers are Peripateticks, or Stoicks; unleſs I firſt know what was the doctrin of the Peripateticks, and Stoicks; ſo is it impoſſible that I ſhould certainly know any company to be the Church of Chriſt, before I know what is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of Chriſt, the Profeſſion whereof conſtitutes the viſible Church, the Belief and Obedience the inviſible. And therefore whereas you would have him be directed by the Catholique Church to the doctrin of Chriſt; the contrary rather is moſt certain and neceſſary, that by the fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the doctrin of Chriſt, he muſt be directed to a certain aſſurance, which is the Catholique Church, if he mean not to chooſe at a venture, but deſire to have certain direction to it. This ſuppoſition therefore, being the hinge whereon your whole Diſcourſe turns, is the <hi>Minerva</hi> of your own Brain; and therefore, were it but for this, have we not great reaſon to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe you of ſtrange immodeſty, in ſaying as you do, That <hi>the whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and Inferences which here you have made, are either D.</hi> Potters <hi>own direct aſſertions, or evident conſequences clearly deduced from them?</hi> Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſeeing your proceeding in it, is ſo conſonant to this ill beginning, that it is in a manner wholly made made up, not of D. <hi>Potters</hi> aſſertions, but your own fictions obtruded on him.</p>
                        <p n="54">54. To the next Queſtion, <hi>Cannot General Councils err?</hi> You pretend he anſwers, <hi>They may err damnably.</hi> Let the Reader ſee the place, and he ſhall find, <hi>damnably</hi> is your addition. To the third Demand, <hi>Muſt I conſult,</hi> (about my difficulties) <hi>with every particular perſon of the Catholick Church?</hi> You anſwer for him, (that which is moſt falſe) that <hi>it ſeems ſo by his words; The whole militant Church, that is, all the members of it cannot poſsibly err ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the whole faith, or any neceſſary Article of it:</hi> which is very certain, for ſhould it do ſo, it ſhould be the Church no longer. But what ſenſe is there that you ſhould collect out of theſe words, that every member of the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church muſt be conſulted with? By like reaſon, if he had ſaid that all men in the world cannot err; If he ſaid that God in his own perſon, or his Angels could not erre in theſe matters, you might have gathered from hence, that he laid a neceſſity upon men in doubt, to conſult with Angels, or with God in his own perſon, or with All men in the world. Is it not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all ſober men, that to make any man or men fit to be conſulted with, beſides the underſtanding of the matter, it is abſolutely requiſite that they may be ſpoken with? And is it not apparently impoſſible, that any man ſhould ſpeak with all the members of the Militant Church? Or, if he had ſpoken with them All, know that he had done ſo? Nay does not D. <hi>Potter</hi> ſay as much in plain terms? Nay more, do not you take notice that he does ſo in the very next words before theſe, where you ſay, <hi>he affirms that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church cannot be told of private injuries:</hi> unleſs you will perſwade us there is a difference between the Catholique Church, and the whole Militant Church. For whereas you make him deny this of the Catholique Church united, and affirm it of the Militant Church diſperſed into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars; The truth is, he ſpeaks neither of united nor diſperſed, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms ſimply (as appears to your ſhame by your own quotations) that <hi>the Catholique Church cannot be told of private injuries:</hi> and then, that the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64345:116"/>
                           <hi>whole Militant Church cannot erre.</hi> But then beſides, that the united Church cannot be conſulted, and the diſperſed may, What a wild imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is it? and what a ſtrange injuſtice was it in you to father it upon him? I beſeech you Sir, to conſider ſeriouſly, how far blind zeal to your ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath tranſported you beyond all bounds of honeſty and diſcretion, and made you careleſs of ſpeaking either truth or ſenſe, ſo you ſpeak againſt D. <hi>Potter!</hi>

A ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council may err; therefore you muſt travel all the world over, and conſult with every particular Chriſtian! As if there were nothing elſe to be conſulted with: Nay, as if according to the Doctrin of Proteſtants, (for ſo you muſt ſay,) there were nothing to be conſulted with, but only, a general Council, or all the World! Have you never heard that Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants ſay, That men for their direction muſt conſult with Scripture? Nay, doth not D. <hi>Potter</hi> ſay it often in this very Book which you are confuting? Nay more, in this very page out of which you take this piece of your <hi>Cento, A General Council may erre damnably?</hi> are there not theſe plain words, <hi>In ſearches of Truth</hi> (he means divine Truth) <hi>God ever directs us to the infallible Rule of Truth, the Scripture?</hi> With what conſcience then, or modeſty, can you impoſe upon him this unreaſonable conſequence, and pretend that your whole diſcourſe, is either his own direct aſſertions, or evident conſequences, clearly deduced from them? You add, that yet he teaches (as if he contradicted himſelf) <hi>that the promiſes of God made to the Church for his aſsiſtance, are not intended to particular perſons, but only to the Catholick Church:</hi> which ſure agrees very well with any thing ſaid by D. <hi>Potter.</hi> If it be repugnant to what you ſaid for him falſely, what is that to him?</p>
                        <p n="56">56. Neither yet is this <hi>to drive any man to deſperation:</hi> unleſs it be ſuch a one, as hath ſuch a ſtrong affection to this word, <hi>Church,</hi> that he will not go to Heaven, <hi>unleſs he hath a Church to lead him thither.</hi> For what though a Council may err, and the whole Church cannot be conſulted with, yet this is not to ſend you on the Fool's <hi>Pilgrimage for Faith,</hi> and bid you go and <hi>conferre with every Chriſtian ſoul, man and woman, by Sea and by Land, cloſe priſoner or at liberty,</hi> as you dilate the matter: But to tell you very briefly, that Univerſal Tradition directs you to the Word of God, and the Word of God directs you to Heaven. And therefore here is no cauſe of deſperation, no cauſe for you to be ſo vain, and tragical, as here you would ſeem. <hi>Yet upon Suppoſal</hi> (you ſay) <hi>of this miraculous pilgrimage for Faith, before I have the Faith of Miracles, how ſhall I proceed at our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?

                        <p n="57">57. Wherein I am yet more confirmed, by the Anſwer you put in his mouth to your next demand, <hi>How ſhall I know whether he hold all Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal points or no?</hi> For, whereas hereunto D. <hi>Potter</hi> having given one Anſwer fully ſatisfactory to it, which is, <hi>If he truly believe the undoubted Books of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Scripture, he cannot but believe all Fundamentals;</hi> and another, which is but ſomething towards a full ſatisfaction of it, That <hi>the Creed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all the Fundamentals of ſimple Belief:</hi> you take no notice of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and pervert the latter, and make him ſay, <hi>The Creed contains all Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of Faith.</hi> Whereas you know, and, within ſix or ſeven lines after this, confeſs, that he never pretended it to contain <hi>all ſimply,</hi> but <hi>all of one ſort,</hi> all <hi>neceſſary Points of ſimple belief.</hi> Which aſſertion becauſe he modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivers as very probable (being willing to conclude rather leſs than more than his reaſons require,) hereupon you take occaſion to ask: <hi>Shall I haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard my ſoul on probabilities, or even wagers!</hi> As if, whatſoever is but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, though in the higheſt degree of probability, were as likely to be falſe as true!

By this reaſon, ſeeing the truth of your whole Religion depends final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon <hi>Prudential motives,</hi> which you do but pretend to be very credible, it will be <hi>an even wager that your Religion is falſe.</hi> And by the ſame reaſon, or rather infinitely greater, ſeeing it is impoſſible for any man (according to the grounds of your Religion) to know himſelf, much leſs another to be a true Pope, or a true Prieſt; nay, to have a Moral certainty of it; becauſe theſe things are abnoxious to innumerable ſecret and undiſcernable nullities, it will be an even wager, nay (if we proportion things indifferently,) a hundred to one, that every Conſecration and Abſolution of yours is void, and that whenſoever you adore the Hoſt, you and your Aſſiſtants commit Idolatry: That there is a nullity in any Decree that a Pope ſhall make, or any Decree of a Council which he ſhall confirm: Particularly, it will be, at leaſt any even wager, that all the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> are void, becauſe it is at moſt but very probable that the Pope which confirmed them was true Pope.

This which follows: <hi>Read my Anſwer to a late Popiſh Pamphlet, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, Charity Miſtaken: There you ſhall find that Fundamental doctrins, are ſuch Catholique verities, as principally and eſſentially pertain to the Faith, ſuch as properly conſtitute a Church, and are neceſſary in ordinary courſe, to be diſtinctly believed by every Chriſtian that will be ſaved. They are thoſe Grand and Captital Doctrins which make up our Faith, that is, the Common Faith, which is alike pretious in all; being one and the ſame, in the higheſt Apoſtle, and the meaneſt believer, which the Apoſtle elſewhere cals, The firſt Principles of the Oracles of God, and, The form of ſound words.</hi>

                        <p n="61">61. But in earneſt, Good Sir, doth the Doctor in theſe places by you quoted, make to this queſtion this ſame ſottiſh anſwer? Or do you think that againſt an Heretique nothing is unlawful? Certainly, if he doth anſwer thus, I will make bold to ſay, he is a very fool. But if he does not, (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he does not) then—: But I forbear you, and beſeech the Reader to conſult the places of D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s Book; and there he ſhall find, that, in the former half of theſe (as you call them) varyed words and phraſes, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared only what he meant by the word <hi>Fundamental,</hi> which was needful to prevent miſtakes, and cavilling about the meaning of the word, which is metaphorical, and therefore ambiguous; and that the latter half of them, are ſeveral places of Scripture imployed by D. <hi>Potter,</hi> to ſhew that his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Fundamental and not Fundamental hath expreſs ground in it. Now of theſe two places, very pertinent unto two very good purpoſes; you have exceeding fairly patcht together a moſt ridiculous Anſwer, to a Queſtion, that D. <hi>Potter</hi> never dreamed of. <hi>But the words,</hi> you will ſay, <hi>are in D.</hi> Potters <hi>Book, though in divers places, and to other purpoſes.</hi> Very true: And ſo the words of <hi>Auſonius</hi> his obſcene <hi>Feſcennine,</hi> are taken out of <hi>Virgil,</hi> yet <hi>Virgil</hi> ſurely was not the Author of this Poem.

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:64345:118"/>you be ignorant which are ſo, and which are not ſo. Now, I believe, your deſire to know which are Fundamentals, proceeds only from a deſire to be aſſured that you do believe them; which ſeeing you may be aſſured of, without knowing which they be, what can it be but curioſity to deſire to deſire to know it? Neither may you think to mend your ſelf herein one whit by having recourſe to them whom we call Papiſts; for they are as far to ſeek as we in this Point, which of the Articles of the Creed are, for their nature, and matter, Fundamental, and which are not. Particularly, you will ſcarce meet with any amongſt their Doctors, ſo adventurous as to tell you for a certain, Whether or no the conception of Chriſt by the Holy Ghoſt, his being born of a Virgin, his Burial, his Deſcent into Hell, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints, be Points of their own nature and matter Fundamental. Such I mean, as without the diſtinct and explicite knowledge of them no man can be ſaved.</p>
                        <p n="63">63. But you will ſay, <hi>at leaſt they give this certain Rule, that all Points de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by Chriſt's viſible Church, belong to the foundation of faith, in ſuch ſenſe, as, to deny any ſuch, cannot ſtand with Salvation.</hi> So alſo Proteſtants give you this more certain Rule, That whoſoever believes heartily thoſe books of Scripture, which all the Chriſtian Churches in the world acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be Canonical, and ſubmits himſelf indeed to this, as to the rule of his belief, muſt of neceſſity believe all things Fundamental; and, if he live according to his faith, cannot fail of Salvation. But beſides, What cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty have you, that that rule of Papiſts is ſo certain? By the viſible Church it is plain, they mean only their own: and why their own only ſhould be the Viſible Church, I do not underſtand: and as little, why all Points defined by this Church ſhould belong to the foundation of faith. Theſe things you had need ſee well and ſubſtantially proved, before you rely upon them, otherwiſe you expoſe your ſelf to danger of imbracing damnable errors inſtead of Fundamental truths. But you will ſay, D. <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelf acknowledges, that you do not err in Fundamentals.</hi> If he did ſo, yet me-thinks you have no reaſon to reſt upon his acknowledgement with any ſecurity, whom you condemn of error in many other matters. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, exceſs of Charity to your perſons, may make him cenſure your errors more favourably than he ſhould do. But the truth is, and ſo I have often told you, though the Doctor hopes that your errors are not ſo unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſtructive, but that ſome men, who ignorantly hold them may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet <hi>in themſelves</hi> he profeſſes and proclaims them <hi>damnable,</hi> and ſuch as, he fears, will be certainly deſtructive to ſuch as you are, that is, to all thoſe, <hi>who have eyes to ſee and will not ſee them.</hi>

But preſently forgetting your ſelf, inſtead of anſwering his Arguments, you fall a confuting his Anſwers to your own. The arguments objected by you which here you vindicate, were two.
<list>
                              <item>1. <hi>The Scripture is not ſo much as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Creed, therefore the Creed contains not all things neceſſary to be believed.</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>2. <hi>Baptiſm is not contained in the Creed, therefore not all things neceſſary.</hi>
                              </item>
                           </list> To both which Arguments my anſwer ſhortly is this, that they prove ſomething, but it is that which no man here denies. For. D. <hi>Potter</hi> (as you have alſo confeſſed) never ſaid, nor undertook to ſhew, that the Apoſtles intended to comprize in the Creed, all Points abſolutely, which
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:64345:118"/>we are bound to believe, or after ſufficient propoſal, not to disbelieve; which yet here and every where you are obtruding upon him: But only that they purpoſed to comprize in it, all ſuch doctrines purely ſpeculative, all ſuch matters of ſimple belief, as are in ordinary courſe, neceſſary to be diſtinctly and explicitly believed by all men. Now neither of theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections do any way infringe or impeach the truth of this Aſſertion. Not the firſt, becauſe according to your own doctrin, all men are not bound to know explicitely what books of Scripture are Canonical. Nor the ſecond, becauſe Baptiſm is not a matter of Faith, but practice: not ſo much to be believed, as to be given, and received. And againſt theſe Anſwers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have brought any conſiderable new matter, let the indifferent Reader judge. As for the other things, which D. <hi>Potter</hi> rather glanceth at than builds upon in anſwering theſe objections, as the Creeds being collected out of Scripture, and, ſuppoſing the Authority of it, which <hi>Grege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of <hi>Valentia</hi> in the place above cited, ſeems to me to confeſs, to have been the Judgment of the Ancient Fathers: and the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creeds inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating the authority of Canonical Scripture, and making mention of Baptiſm: Theſe things were ſaid <hi>ex abundanti;</hi> and therefore I conceive it ſuperfluous to examine your exceptions againſt them. Prove that D. <hi>Potter</hi> did affirm that the Creed contains all things neceſſary to be believed of all ſorts, and then theſe objections will be pertinent, and deſerve an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Or produce ſome Point of ſimple belief, neceſſary to be explicitely believed, which is not contained either in terms, or by conſequence in the Creed, and then I will either anſwer your Reaſons, or confeſs I cannot. But all this while you do but trifle, and are ſo far from hitting the Mark, that you rove quite beſide the Butt.</p>
                        <p n="65">65. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 23, 24, 25. D. <hi>Potter</hi> demands, <hi>How it can be neceſſary for any Chriſtian to have more in his Creed than the Apoſtles had, and the Church of their times?</hi> You Anſwer, <hi>That he trifles, not diſtinguiſhing between the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles belief, and that abridgment of ſome Articles of faith, which we call the Apoſtles Creed.</hi> I reply, that it is you which trifle, affectedly confounding (what D. <hi>Potter</hi> hath plainly diſtinguiſhed) the Apoſtles belief of the whole Religion of Chriſt, as it comprehends both what we are to do, and what we are to believe, with their belief of that part of it, which contains not duties of obedience, but only the neceſſary Articles of ſimple Faith. Now though the Apoſtles Belief be, in the former ſenſe, a larger thing than that which we call the Apoſtles Creed: yet in the latter ſenſe of the word, the Creed (I ſay) is a full comprehenſion of their belief, which you your ſelf have formerly confeſſed, though ſomewhat fearfully, and inconſtantly: and here again unwillingneſs to ſpeak the truth, makes you ſpeak that which is hardly ſenſe, and call it <hi>an abridgement of ſome Articles of Faith.</hi> For I demand, theſe <hi>ſome Articles</hi> which you ſpeak of, Which are they? Thoſe that are out of the Creed, or thoſe that are in it? Thoſe that are in it, it comprehends at large, and therefore it is not an abridgement of them: Thoſe that are out of it, it comprehends not at all, and therefore it is not an abridgement of them. If you would call it now an abridgment of the Faith, this would be ſenſe, and ſignifie thus much, That all the neceſſary Articles of the Chriſtian Faith are compriſed in it. For this is the proper duty of Abridgements, to leave out nothing neceſſary, and to take in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unneceſſary.</p>

66. Moreover, in anſwer to this demand you tell us, that <hi>the Doctor begs the Queſtion, ſuppoſing that the Apoſtles believed no more than is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in their Creed,</hi> I Anſwer, He ſuppoſes no ſuch matter; but only that they knew no more neceſſary Articles of ſimple belief, than what are contained in their Creed. So that here you abuſe D. <hi>Potter</hi> and your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by taking ſophiſtically without limitation, that which is delivered with limitation.</p>
                        <p n="67">67. But this Demand of D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s, was equivalent to a Negation, and intended for one: <hi>How can it be neceſſary for any Chriſtian, to have more in his Creed, than the Apoſtles had?</hi> All one with this, <hi>It cannot be neceſſary,</hi> &amp;c. And this negation of his, he inforces with many arguments which he propoſes by way of interrogation, thus. <hi>May the Church of after Ages make the narrow way to Heaven, narrower than our Saviour left it? Shall it be a fault to ſtraiten and encumber the King's high way with publique nuiſances; and is it lawful by adding new Articles to the Faith, to retrench any thing from the Latitude of the King of Heavens high way to eternal Happineſs? The yoke of Chriſt, which he ſaid was eaſie, may it be juſtly made heavier by the Governors of the Church in after-ages? The Apoſtles profeſs they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to the Church the whole Counſel of God, keeping back nothing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for our Salvation: What tyranny then, to impoſe any new unneceſſary matters on the Faith of Chriſtians, eſpecially (as the late Popes have done) under the high commanding form,</hi> Qui non crediderit, damnabitur? <hi>If this may be done, Why then did our Saviour reprehend the Phariſes ſo ſharply, for binding heavy burdens, and laying them on mens ſhoulders? And why did he teach them, that in vain they worſhipped God, teaching for Doctrines mens Traditions? And why did the Apoſtles call it tempting of God, to lay thoſe things upon the necks of Chriſtians, that were not neceſſary?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="68">68. All which Interrogations ſeem to me to contain ſo many plain and convincing Arguments of the premiſed Aſſertion; to all which (one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,) according to the advice of the beſt Maſters of Rhetorick in ſuch Caſes, you have anſwered very diſcreetly, by ſaying O. But when you write again, I pray take notice of them: and, if you can deviſe no fair, and ſatisfying Anſwer to them, then be ſo ingenuous as to grant the Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That no more can be neceſſary for Chriſtians to believe now, than was in the Apoſtles time. A concluſion of great importance, for the deciſion of many Controverſies, and the disburdening of the Faith of Chriſt from many incumbrances.</p>
                        <p n="69">69. As for that one, which you thought you could faſten upon, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the 20. Act. 27. let me tell you plainly, that by your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering this, you have ſhewed plainly that it was wiſely done of you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the reſt. You tell D. <hi>Potter,</hi> That <hi>needful for ſalvation</hi> is his gloſs, which perhaps you intended for a piece of an Anſwer. But, good Sir, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the place, and you ſhall find, that there S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ſays that he kept back <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>not any thing that was profitable:</hi> and, I hope, you will make no difficulty to grant, that whatſoever is needful for ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is very profitable.</p>
                        <p n="70">70. But then you ſay, <hi>This is no proof unleſs he beg the Queſtion, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that whatſoever the Apoſtles revealed to the Church is contained in the Creed.</hi> I Anſwer, it is not D. <hi>Potter</hi> that begs the Queſtion, but you that miſtake it: which is not here in this particular place, Whether all Points
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:64345:119"/>of ſimple Belief neceſſary for the ſalvation of the Primitive Chriſtians, were contained in the Apoſtles Symbol? (for that and the proofs of it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after, in the next §. p. 223. of D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s Book): but, Whether any thing can be neceſſary for Chriſtians to believe now, which was not ſo from the beginning? D. <hi>Potter</hi> maintains the Negative; and to make good his opinion, thus he argues S. <hi>Paul</hi> declared to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> the whole Counſel of God touching their Salvation; Therefore that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> did not declare, can be no part of the Counſel of God, and therefore not neceſſary. And again: S. <hi>Paul</hi> kept back nothing from the <hi>Epheſians</hi> that was profitable; Therefore he taught them all things neceſſary to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Conſider this, I pray, a little better, and then, I hope, you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that here was no <hi>Petitio principii,</hi> in D. <hi>Potter;</hi> but rather <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noratio Elenchi,</hi> in you.</p>
                        <p n="71">71. Neither is it material, that theſe words were particularly directed by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to the Paſtors of the Church: For (to ſay nothing that the Point here iſſuable, is not, Whom he taught, whether Prieſts or Laymen? But how much he taught, and whether all things neceſſary?) it appears plainly out of the Text, and I wonder you ſhould read it ſo negligently as not to obſerve it, that though he ſpeaks now to the Paſtors, yet he ſpeaks of what he taught not only them, but alſo the Laity as well as them. <hi>I have kept back nothing</hi> (ſays S. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>that was profitable, but have ſhewed, and have taught you publikely, and from houſe, to houſe; Teſtifying</hi> (I pray obſerve) <hi>both to the Jews, and alſo to the Greeks, Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And a little after, <hi>I know that ye all, among whom I have gone Preaching the Kingdom of God, ſhall ſee my face no more: Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am innocent from the blood of all men; for I have kept nothing back, but have ſhewed you all the Counſel of God.</hi> And again, <hi>Remember that by the ſpace of three years I ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to warn every one night and day with tears.</hi> Certainly, though he did all theſe things to the Paſtors among the reſt, nay above the reſt, yet, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Controverſie, they whom he taught publikely, and from houſe to houſe: The <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> to whom he teſtified, (1.) preached Faith and Repentance: Thoſe all, amongſt whom he went preaching the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God: Thoſe Every one, whom for three years together he warned, were not Biſhops and Paſtors only.</p>
                        <p n="72">72. Neither is this to ſay, that the Apoſtles taught Chriſtians nothing but their Creed, nothing of the Sacraments, Commandments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for that is not here the point to be proved: but only, that they taught them all things neceſſary, ſo that nothing can be neceſſary which they did not teach them. But how much of this they put into their Creed, Whether <hi>all the neceſſary Points of ſimple Belief,</hi> as we pretend, or only as you ſay, <hi>I know not what,</hi> is another Queſtion and which comes now to be farther examined. D. <hi>Potter</hi> in confirmation of it, beſides the authorities which you formerly ſhifted off, with ſo egregious tergiverſation, urges five ſeveral Arguments.</p>
                        <p n="73">73. The ſenſe of the firſt is this, <hi>If all the neceſſary Points of ſimple of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief be not comprized in the Creed, it can no way deſerve the name of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Creed, as not being their Creed in any ſenſe, but only a part of it.</hi> To this you Anſwer §. 25. <hi>Upon the ſame affected ambiguity,</hi> &amp;c. Anſw. It is very true that their whole faith was of a larger extent, but that was not the Queſtion: But whether all the Points of ſimple belief which they taught
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:64345:120"/>as neceſſary to be explicitely believed, be not contained in it? And if thus much at leaſt of Chriſtian Religion, be not comprized in it, I again deſire you to inform me, How it could be called the Apoſtles Creed!</p>
                        <p n="74">74. Four other Reaſons D. <hi>Potter</hi> urges to the ſame purpoſe, grounded upon the practice of the Ancient Church; The laſt whereof you anſwer in the ſecond part of your Book. But to the reſt, drawn from the ancient Churches appointing her Infants to be inſtructed (for matters of ſimple be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,) only in the Creed: From her admitting Catechumens unto Baptiſm: and of Strangers to her Communion upon their only profeſſion of the Creed, you have not, for ought I can perceive, thought fit to make any kind of Anſwer.</p>
                        <p n="75">75. The difficulties of the 27. and laſt §. of this Chapter, have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. So that there remains unexamined only the 26. <hi>Section,</hi> wherein you exceed your ſelf in Sophiſtry: Eſpecially in that trick of Cavillers, which is to anſwer objections by other objections; an excellent way to make controverſies endleſs! D. <hi>Potter</hi> deſires to be reſolved, <hi>Why amongſt many things of equal neceſsity to be believed, the Apoſtles ſhould diſtinctly ſet down ſome in the Creed, and be altogether ſilent of others?</hi> Inſtead of reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him in this difficulty, you put another to him, and that it is, <hi>Why are ſome Points not Fundamental expreſſed in it, rather than others of the ſame quality?</hi> Which demand is ſo far from ſatisfying the former Doubt, that it makes it more intricate. For upon this ground it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, How was it poſſible that the Apoſtles ſhould leave out any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles ſimply neceſſary, and put in others not neceſſary, eſpecially if their intention were (as you ſay it was) to deliver it in ſuch Articles as were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt for thoſe times? Unleſs (which were wondrous ſtrange) unneceſſary Articles were fitter for thoſe times, than neceſſary. But now to your Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, the Anſwer is obvious: Theſe unneceſſary things might be put in becauſe they were circumſtances of the neceſſary; <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> of Chriſt's Paſſion; The third day, of the Reſurrection. Neither doth the adding of them make the Creed ever a whit the leſs portable, the leſs fit to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and remembred. And for the contrary reaſons, other unneceſſary things might be left out. Beſide, who ſees not, that the addition of ſome unneceſſary circumſtances is a thing that can hardly be avoided without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation! And therefore not ſo great a fault, nor deſerving ſuch a cenſure, as the omiſſion of any thing eſſential to the work undertaken, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the end propoſed in it.</p>
                        <p n="76">76. You demand again (as it is no hard matter to multiply demands) <hi>Why our Saviour's deſcent to Hell, and Burial was expreſſed, end not his Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, his manifeſtation to the three Kings, and working of Miracles?</hi> I anſwer: His Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and Sitting at the right hand of God are very great Miracles, and they are expreſſed. Beſides, S. <hi>John</hi> aſſures us, <hi>That the Miracles which Chriſt did, were done and written not for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they might be believed;</hi> but for a farther end, that <hi>we might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Jeſus was the Chriſt, and believing have eternal life.</hi> He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that believe this may be ſaved, though he have no explicite and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct faith of any Miracle that our Saviour did. His Circumciſion and Manifeſtation to the Wiſe men (for I know not upon what grounds you call them <hi>Kings</hi>) are neither things ſimply neceſſary to be known, nor have any neer relation to thoſe that are ſo. As for his Deſcent into hell, it may
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:64345:120"/>(for ought you know) be put in as a thing neceſſary of it ſelf to be known. If you ask, why more than his Circumciſion? I refer you to the Apoſtles for an anſwer, who put that in, and left this out of their Creed: and yet ſure, were not ſo <hi>forgetful after the receiving of the Holy Ghoſt, as to leave out any prime and principal foundation of the Faith,</hi> which are the very words of your own <hi>Gordonius Huntlaeus, Contr.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>num.</hi> Likewiſe his Burial was put in perhaps as neceſſary of it ſelf to be known. But though it were not, yet hath it manifeſtly ſo near relation to theſe that are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, his Paſſion, and Reſurrection; (being the Conſequent of the one, and the Antecedent of the other,) that it is no marvel if for their ſakes it was put in. For though I verily believe that there is no neceſſary Point of this nature, but what is in the Creed, yet I do not affirm, becauſe I cannot prove it, that there is nothing in the Creed but what is neceſſary. You demand thirdly, <hi>Why did they not expreſs Scriptures, Sacraments, and all Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Points of Faith tending to practice, as well as thoſe which reſt in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief?</hi> I anſwer; Becauſe their purpoſe was to comprize in it only thoſe neceſſary Points which reſt in Belief: which appears, becauſe of practical Points there is not in it ſo much as one.</p>
                        <p n="77">77. D. <hi>Potter</hi> ſubjoyns to what is ſaid above, <hi>That as well, nay better, they might have given no Article but that of the Church, and ſent us to the Church for all the reſt: For in ſetting down others beſides that, and not all, they make us believe we have all, when we have not all.</hi> This conſequence you deny: and neither give reaſon againſt it, nor ſatisfie his reaſon for it, which yet in my judgment is good and concluding. The Propoſition to be proved is this: That, if your Doctrin were true, this ſhort Creed, <hi>I believe the Roman Church to be infallible,</hi> would have been better, that is, more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to keep the believers of it from Hereſie, and in the true Faith, than this Creed which now we have. A Propoſition ſo evident, that I cannot ſee how either you, or any of your Religion, or indeed any ſenſible man can from his heart deny it. Yet becauſe you make ſhew of doing ſo, or elſe, which I rather hope, do not rightly apprehend the force of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I will endeavour briefly to add ſome light and ſtrength to it, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the effects of theſe ſeveral ſuppoſed Creeds.</p>
                        <p n="78">78. The former Creed therefore would certainly produce theſe effects in the believers of it: An impoſſibility of being in any formal Hereſie: A neceſſity of being prepared in mind to come out of all Error in Faith, or material Hereſie; which certainly you will not deny; or, if you do, you pull down the only pillar of your Church and Religion, and deny that which is in effect the only thing you labour to prove through your whole Book.</p>
                        <p n="79">79. The latter Creed which now we have, is ſo uneffectual for theſe good purpoſes, that you your ſelf tell us of innumerable, groſs, damnable Hereſies, that have been, are, and may be, whoſe contrary Truths are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther explicitly, nor by conſequence comprehended in this Creed: So that no man by the belief of this Creed without the former, can be poſſibly guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from falling into them, and continuing obſtinate in them. Nay, ſo far is this Creed from guarding them from theſe miſchiefs, that it is more likely to enſnare them into them, by ſeeming and yet not being a full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of all neceſſary Points of Faith: which is apt (as experience ſhews,) to miſ-guide men into this (as you conceive it) pernitious error,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64345:121"/>That believing the Creed, they believe all neceſſary Points of Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeed, according to you, they do not ſo. Now upon theſe grounds I thus conclude: That Creed, which hath great commodities and no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, would certainly be better than that which hath great danger, and wants many of theſe great commodities. But the former ſhort Creed propos'd by me, <hi>I believe the Roman Church to be infallible,</hi> (if your doctrin be true) is of the former condition, and the latter, that is, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Creed, is of the latter, Therefore the former (if your doctrin be true) would without controverſie be better than the latter.</p>
                        <p n="80">80. But (ſay you) by this kind of arguing, one might infer quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>If the Apoſtles Creed contain all Points neceſſary to Salvation, What need have we of any Church to teach us? And conſequently what need of the Article of the Church?</hi> To which I anſwer, that having compared your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s together, I cannot diſcover any ſhadow of reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between them, nor any ſhew of Reaſon, why the perfection of the Apoſtles Creed, ſhould exclude a neceſſity of ſome body to deliver it. Much leſs why the whole Creed's containing all things neceſſary ſhould make the belief of a part of it unneceſſary. As well (for ought I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand) you might avouch this inference to be as good as D. <hi>Potters:</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles Creed contains all things neceſſary, therefore there is no need to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God. Neither doth it follow ſo well as D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s Argument fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That if the Apoſtles Creed contains all things neceſſary, that all other Creeds and Catechiſms, wherein are added divers other Particulars, are ſuperfluous. For theſe other Particulars may be the duties of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they may be profitable Points of Doctrine, they may be good expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the Apoſtles Creed, and ſo not ſuperfluous; and yet for all this the Creed may ſtill contain all Points of Belief that are ſimply neceſſary. Theſe therefore are poor conſequences, but no more like D. <hi>Potters</hi> than an apple is like an oiſter.</p>
                        <p n="81">81. But this conſequence after you have ſufficiently ſlighted and diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, at length you promiſe <hi>us news, and pretend to grant it.</hi> But what is that which you mean to grant? That the Apoſtles did put no Article in their Creed but only that of the Church? Or that, if they had done ſo, they had done better than now they have done? This is D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence out of your Doctrin: and truly, if you ſhould grant this, this were news indeed? <hi>Yes,</hi> ſay you, <hi>I will grant it, but only thus far, that Chriſt hath referred us only to his Church.</hi> Yea, but this is clean another thing, and no news at all, that you ſhould grant that, which you would fain have granted to you. So that your dealing with us is juſt as if a man ſhould proffer me a courteſie, and pretend that he would oblige himſelf by a note under his hand, to give me twenty pound; and inſtead of it write, that I owe him forty, and deſire me to ſubſctibe to it and be thankful. Of ſuch favours as theſe it is very ſafe to be liberal.</p>
                        <p n="82">82. You tell us afterward (but how it comes in I know not) that <hi>it were a childiſh argument, The Creed contains not all things neceſſary;</hi> Ergo, <hi>It is not profitable!</hi> Or, <hi>The Church alone is ſufficient to teach us by ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient means:</hi> Ergo, <hi>She muſt teach us without means.</hi> Theſe indeed are childiſh arguments; but, for ought I ſee, you alone are the father of them: for, in D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s book, I can neither meet with them, nor any like them. He indeed tels you, that if (by an impoſſible ſuppoſition) your Doctrin were
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:64345:121"/>true, another and a far ſhorter Creed would have been more expedient: even this alone, <hi>I believe the</hi> Roman <hi>Church to be infallible.</hi> But why you ſhould conclude, he makes this Creed which we have, unprofitable; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſays another that might be conceived upon this falſe ſuppoſition, would be more profitable: or, that he lays a neceſſity upon the Church, of teaching without means: or, of not teaching this very Creed which now is taught; theſe things are ſo ſubtil that I cannot apprehend them. To my underſtanding, by thoſe words, <hi>And ſent us to the Church for all the reſt,</hi> he does rather manifeſtly imply, that the reſt might be very well, not only profitable but neceſſary, and that the Church was to teach this by Creeds, or Catechiſms, or Councels, or any other means which ſhe ſhould make choice of; for, being Infallible, ſhe could not chuſe amiſs.</p>
                        <p n="83">83. Whereas therefore you ſay, <hi>If the Apoſtles had expreſt no Article but that of the Catholique Church, ſhe muſt have taught us the other Articles in particular by Creeds, or other means:</hi> This is very true, but no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the truth of this which follows, that the Apoſtles (if your doctrin be true) had done better ſervice to the Church, though they had never made this Creed of theirs which now we have, if, in ſtead thereof, they had commanded in plain terms that for mens perpetual direction in the Faith, this ſhort Creed ſhould be taught all men, <hi>I believe the</hi> Roman <hi>Church ſhall be for ever infallible.</hi> Yet you muſt not ſo miſtake me, as if I meant, that they had done better, not to have taught the Church the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Chriſtian Religion; For then the Church not having learnt it of them, could not have taught it us, This therefore I do not ſay: but, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing they had written theſe Scriptures as they have written, wherein all the Articles of their Creed are plainly delivered, and preached that Doctrin which they did preach, and done all other things as they have done, beſides the compoſing their Symbol: I ſay, if your doctrin were true, they had done a work infinitely more beneficial to the Church of Chriſt, if they had never compoſed their Symbol, which is but an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect comprehenſion of the neceſſary Points of ſimple Belief, and no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctive mark (as a Symbol ſhould be) between thoſe that are good Chriſtians, and thoſe that are not ſo; But inſtead thereof, had delivered this one Propoſition, which would have been certainly effectual for all the aforeſaid good intents and purpoſes, <hi>The</hi> Roman <hi>Church ſhall be for ever infallible in all things, which ſhe propoſes as matters of Faith.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="84">84. Whereas you ſay, <hi>If we will believe we have all in the Creed when we have not all, it is not the Apoſtles fault but our own:</hi> I tell you plainly, if it be a fault, I know not whoſe it ſhould be but theirs. For ſure it can be no fault in me to follow ſuch Guides whitherſoever they lead me; Now, I ſay, they have led me into this perſwaſion, becauſe they have given me great reaſon to believe it, and none to the contrary. The reaſon they have given me to believe it, is, becauſe it is apparent and confeſt, they did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to themſelves in compoſing it, ſome good end or ends: As <hi>that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans might have a form, by which</hi> (for matter of Faith) <hi>they might profeſs themſelves Catholiques.</hi> So <hi>Putean</hi> out of <hi>Tho. Aquinas: That the faithful might know, what the Chriſtian people is to believe explicitly.</hi> So <hi>Vincent Fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucius: That being ſeparated into divers parts of the World, they might preach the ſame thing:</hi> And, <hi>that, that might ſerve as a mark to diſtinguiſh true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians from Infidels,</hi> So Card, <hi>Riclieu.</hi> Now for all theſe &amp; for any other good
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64345:122"/>intent, I ſay, it will be plainly uneffectual, unleſs it contain at leaſt all Points of ſimple Belief, which are, in ordinary courſe, neceſſary to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly known by all men. So that, if it be a fault in me to believe this, it muſt be my fault to believe the Apoſtles, wiſe and good men: which I cannot do if I believe not this. And therefore, what <hi>Richardus de ſancto Victore</hi> ſays of God himſelf, I make no ſcruple at all to apply to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and to ſay, <hi>Si error eſt quod credo, à vobis deceptus ſum:</hi> If it be an error which I believe, it is you, and my reverend eſteem of you and your actions, that hath led me into it. For as for your ſuſpition, <hi>That we are led into this perſwaſion, out of a hope that we may the better maintain by it ſome opinions of our own,</hi> It is plainly uncharitable. I know no opinion I have, which I would not as willingly forſake as keep, if I could ſee ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to enduce me to believe, that it is the will of God I ſhould forſake it. Neither do I know any opinion I hold againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but I have more evident grounds then this whereupon to build it. For let but theſe Truths be granted: That the authority of the Scripture is independent on your Church, and dependent only in reſpect of us upon univerſal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; That Scripture is the only Rule of Faith: That all things neceſſary to Salvation are plainly delivered in Scripture: Let, I ſay, theſe moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Divine Truths be laid for Foundations, and let our ſuperſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be conſequent and coherent to them; and, I am confident, Peace would be reſtored, and Truth maintained againſt you, though the Apoſtles Creed were not in the World.</p>

And becauſe Schiſm will be found to be a diviſion from the Church, which could not happen, unleſs there were always a viſible Church; we will, Thirdly, prove or rather take it as a Point to be granted by all Chriſtians, that in all Ages, There hath been ſuch a Viſible Congregation of Faithful People.

For the firſt Point touching the <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>Quality</hi> of Schiſm: As the natural perfection of man conſiſts in his being the <hi>Image</hi> of God his Creator, by the powers of his ſoul; ſo his ſupernatural perfection is placed in <hi>ſimilitude</hi> with God, as his laſt End and Felicity; and, by having the ſaid ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual faculties, his <hi>Underſtanding</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> is linked to him. His Underſtanding is united to God by <hi>Faith;</hi> his Will, by <hi>Charity.</hi> The former relies upon his infallible <hi>Truth:</hi> The latter carrieth us to his infinite <hi>Goodneſs. Faith</hi> hath a deadly oppoſite, <hi>Hereſie.</hi> Contrary to the Union, or Unity of <hi>Charity,</hi> is Separation and <hi>Diviſion.</hi> Charity is twofold. As it reſpects God, his Oppoſite Vice is <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi> againſt God: as it uniteth us to our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> his contrary is <hi>Separation</hi> or diviſion of affections and will, from our <hi>Neighbour.</hi> Our Neighbour may be conſidered, either as one private perſon hath a ſingle relation to another, or as all concur to make one Company or Congregation, which we call the Church; and this is the moſt principal reference and Union of one man with another: becauſe the chiefeſt Unity is that of the <hi>Whole,</hi> to which the particular Unity of <hi>Parts</hi> is ſubordinate. This Unity, or Oneneſs, (if ſo I may call it) is effected by Charity, uniting all the members of the Church in one <hi>Myſtical Body;</hi> contrary to which, is <hi>Schiſm,</hi> from the Greek word ſignifying <hi>Sciſſure,</hi> or <hi>Diviſion.</hi> Wherefore upon the whole matter, we find that <hi>Schiſm,</hi> as the Angelical Doctor, S. <hi>Thomas,</hi> defines it, is; <hi>A voluntary ſeparation</hi>

Nevertheleſs (ſaith S. <hi>Thomas</hi>)<note n="(f)" place="margin">Ubi ſupra,</note> As he who is deprived of Faith muſt needs want Charity: ſo every Heretique is a Schiſmatique, but not converſively every Schiſmatique is an Heretique; though becauſe want of Charity diſpoſes and makes way to the deſtruction of Faith (according to thoſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Which</hi> [a good conſcience] <hi>ſome caſting off, have ſuffered ſhipwrack in their Faith</hi>) Schiſm ſpeedily degenerates to Hereſie, as S. <hi>Hierom</hi> after the rehearſed words teacheth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Though Schiſm in the beginning may in ſome ſort be underſtood different from Hereſie; yet there is no Schiſm which doth not faign ſome Hereſie to it ſelf, that ſo it may ſeem to have departed from the Church upon good reaſon.</hi> Nevertheleſs when Schiſm proceeds originally from Hereſie, Hereſie as being in that caſe the predominant quality in theſe two peccant humours, giveth the denomination of an <hi>Heretique;</hi> as on the other ſide we are wont, eſpecially in the beginning, or for a while, to call <hi>Schiſmatiques,</hi> thoſe men who firſt began with only <hi>Schiſm,</hi> though in proceſs of time they fell into ſome <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and by that means are indeed both Schiſmatiques and Heretiques.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The reaſon why both Hereſie and Schiſm are repugnant to the being of a good <hi>Catholique,</hi> is: Becauſe the <hi>Catholique,</hi> or Univerſal Church ſignifies <hi>One</hi> Congregation, or Company of faithful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and therefore implies not only <hi>Faith,</hi> to make them <hi>Faithful</hi> believers, but alſo <hi>Communion,</hi> or <hi>common Union,</hi> to make them <hi>One</hi> in Charity, which excludes Separation, and <hi>Diviſion:</hi> and therefore in the Apoſtles Creed, <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> is immediatly joyned to the <hi>Catholique Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. From this definition of Schiſm may be inferred, that the guilt thereof is contracted, not only by diviſion from the Univerſal Church; but alſo, by a Separation from a particular Church or Dioceſs which agrees with the Univerſal.

                        <hi>enough for the Church, that the Lord in mercy will ſecure her from all capital dangers, and conſerve her on earth againſt all enemies; but ſhe may not hope to triumph over all ſin and error, till ſhe be in heaven.</hi> Out of which words I obſerve, that, according to D. <hi>Potter,</hi> the ſelf-ſame Church, which is the Univerſal Church, remaining the Univerſal true Church of Chriſt, may fall into errors and corruptions: from whence it clearly followeth, that it is impoſſible to leave the <hi>External communion</hi> of the Church ſo corrupted, and retain <hi>external</hi> communion with the Catholique Church; ſince the Church Catholique, and the Church ſo corrupted is the ſelf-ſame one Church, or company of men. And the contrary imagination talks in a dream, as if the errors and infections of the Catholique Church were not inherent in her, but were ſeparate from her, like to <hi>Accidents</hi> without any <hi>Subject,</hi> or rather indeed, as if they were not <hi>Accidents,</hi> but <hi>Hypoſtaſes,</hi> or <hi>Perſons,</hi> ſubſiſting by themſelves; for men cannot be ſaid to live, in, or out of, the Communion of any dead creature, but with perſons, endued with life and reaſon; and much leſs can men be ſaid to live in the Communion of Accidents, as errors and corruptions are: and therefore it is an abſurd thing to affirm, that Proteſtants divided themſelves from the corruptions of the Church, but not from the Church her ſelf, ſeeing the corruptions of the Church were inherent in the Church. All this is made more clear, if we conſider, that when <hi>Luther</hi> appeared, there were not two diſtinct viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble true Catholique Churches, holding contrary Doctrines, and divided in external Communion; one of the which two Churches did <hi>triumph over all error,</hi> and corruption in Doctrine and practice; but the other was ſtained with both. For to faign this diverſity of two Churches, cannot ſtand with record of hiſtories, which are ſilent of any ſuch matter. It is againſt D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s own grounds, that the Church may err in Points not Fundamental, which were not true, if you will imagine a certain viſible Catholique Church free from error even in Points not Fundamental. It contradicteth the words in which he ſaid, the Church may <hi>not hope to triumph over all error, till ſhe be in heaven.</hi> It evacuateth the brag of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, that <hi>Luther</hi> reformed the whole Church: and laſtly, It maketh <hi>Luther</hi> a Schiſmatique, for leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Communion of all viſible Churches, ſeeing (upon this ſuppoſition) there was a viſible Church of Chriſt free from all corruption, which therefore could not be forſaken without juſt imputation of <hi>Schiſm.</hi> We muſt therefore truly affirm, that ſince there was but one viſible Church of Chriſt, which was truly Catholique, and yet was (according to Proteſtants) ſtained with corruption; when <hi>Luther</hi> left the external Communion of that corrupted Church, he could not remain in the Communion of the Catholique Church, no more than it is poſſible to keep company with D. <hi>Chriſtopher Potter,</hi> and not keep company with the Provoſt of Queens Colledge in Oxford, if D. <hi>Potter</hi> and the Provoſt be one and the ſelf-ſame man: For ſo one ſhould be, and not be, with him at the ſame time. This very Argument, drawn from the Unity of God's Church, S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> urgeth to convince, that <hi>Novatianus</hi> was cut oſt from the Church, in theſe words: <hi>The Church is</hi>

For in this Point there is great difference between <hi>internal acts</hi> of our underſtanding, and will; and of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal deeds.</hi> Our Underſtanding and Will, are faculties (as Philſophers ſpeak) abſtractive, and able to diſtinguiſh, and, as it were, to part things, though in themſelves they be really conjoyned. But real external deeds do take things in groſs as they find them, not ſeparating things which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality are joyned together. Thus, one man may conſider and love a ſinner as he is a man, friend, benefactor, or the like; and at the ſame time not conſider him, nor love him as he is a ſinner; becauſe theſe are acts of our Underſtanding and Will, which may reſpect their objects under ſome one formality, or conſideration, without reference to other things contained in the ſelf-ſame objects. But if one ſhould ſtrike, or kill a ſinful man, he will not be excuſed by alledging that he killed him, not as a man, but as a ſinner; becauſe the ſelf-ſame perſon being a man, and the ſinner, the <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> act of murder fell joyntly upon the man, and the ſinner. And for the ſame reaſon one cannot avoid the company of a ſinner, and at the ſame time be really preſent with that man who is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:64345:125"/>And this is our caſe: and in this our Adverſaries are egregiouſly, and many of them affectedly miſtaken. For one may in ſome Points believe as the Church believeth, and diſagree from her in other. One may love the truth which ſhe holds, and deteſt her (pretended) corruptions. But it is impoſſible that a man ſhould really ſeparate himſelf from her external Communion, as ſhe is corrupted, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally within the ſame external Communion as ſhe is ſound; becauſe ſhe is the ſelf-ſame Church which is ſuppoſed to be ſound in ſome things, and to err in others. Now, our queſtion for the preſent doth concern only this Point of <hi>external Communion:</hi> becauſe <hi>Schiſm,</hi> as it is diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Hereſie,</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted when one divides himſelf from the <hi>External Communion</hi> of that Church with which he agrees in <hi>Faith;</hi> Whereas Hereſie doth neceſſarily imply a difference in matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> and belief: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſay, that they left not the viſible Church; but her errors, can only excuſe them from <hi>Hereſie</hi> (which ſhall be tryed in the next Chapter) but not from <hi>Schiſm,</hi> as long as they are really divided from the <hi>external Communion</hi> of the ſelf-ſame viſible Church; which, notwithſtanding thoſe errors wherein they do in judgment diſſent from her, doth ſtill remain the true Catholique Church of Chriſt; and therefore while they forſake the corrupted Church, they forſake the Catholique Church. Thus then it remaineth clear, that their chiefeſt Anſwer changeth the very ſtate of the queſtion; confoundeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal acts of the Underſtanding with the <hi>external Deeds;</hi> doth not diſtinguiſh between <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie;</hi> and leaves this demonſtrated againſt them, That they divided themſelves from the Communion of the viſible Catholique Church, becauſe they conceived that ſhe needed Reformation.

Now then, that corruptions in Doctrin (I ſtill ſpeak upon the untrue ſuppoſition of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries) could not afford any ſufficient cauſe, or colourable neceſſity to depart from that Viſible Church, which was extant when <hi>Luther</hi> roſe, I demonſtrate out of D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s own confeſſion; that the Catholique Church neither hath, nor can err, in Points <hi>Fundamental,</hi> as we ſhewed out of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:64345:125"/>his own expreſs words, which he alſo of ſet purpoſe delivereth in divers other places, and all they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to maintain the ſame, who teach that Chriſt had alwayes a viſible Church upon earth: becauſe any one <hi>Fundamental</hi> error overthrows the <hi>being</hi> of a true Church. Now (as Schoolmen ſpeak) it is <hi>implica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio in terminis</hi> (a contradiction ſo plain, that one word deſtroyeth the other, as if one ſhould ſay, A living dead man) to affirm, that the Church doth not err in Points neceſſary to Salvation, or damnably; and yet that it is damnable to remain in her Communion, becauſe ſhe teacheth errors which are confeſſed not to be damnable. For if the error be not damnable, nor againſt any Fundamental Article of Faith, the belief thereof cannot be damnable. But D. <hi>Potter</hi> teacheth, that the Catholique Church <hi>cannot,</hi> and that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church <hi>hath not</hi> erred againſt any Fundamental Article of Faith: Therefore it cannot be damnable to remain in her Communion; and ſo the pretended corruptions in her doctrins could not induce any obligation to depart from her Communion; nor could excuſe them from Schiſm, who, upon pretence of neceſſity in Point of Conſcience, forſook her. And D. <hi>Potter</hi> will never be able to ſalve a manifeſt contradiction in theſe his words: <hi>To depart from the Church</hi> (a) <hi>of</hi> Rome <hi>in ſome Doctrins and practiſes, there might be neceſſary cauſe, though ſhe wanted nothing neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> For if, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe Doctrins and practiſes, <hi>ſhe wanted nothing neceſſary to Salvation;</hi> how could it be <hi>neceſſary to Salvation</hi> to forſake her? And therefore we muſt ſtill conclude, that to forſake her was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly an act of <hi>Schiſm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="20">20. From the ſelf-ſame ground of the infallibility of the Church in all Fundamental Points, I argue after this manner: The viſible Church cannot be forſaken without damnation, upon pretence that it is damnable to remain in her Communion, by reaſon of corruption in Doctrin; as long as, for the truth of her Faith and belief, ſhe performeth the duty, which ſhe oweth to God, and her Neighbour: As long as ſhe performeth what our Saviour exacts at her hands: as long as ſhe doth, as much as lies in her power to do. But (even according to D. <hi>Potters</hi> Aſſertions) the Church performeth all theſe things, as long ſhe erreth not in Points Fundamental, although ſhe were ſuppoſed to err in other Points not Fundamental: Therefore, the Communion of the viſible Church cannot be forſaken without dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, upon pretence that it is damnable to remain in her Communion, by reaſon of corruption in Doctrin. The <hi>Major,</hi> or firſt Propoſition, of it ſelf is evident.

And this reaſon is yet ſtronger; if we ſtill remember, that even according to D. <hi>Potter,</hi> the viſible Church hath a bleſſing not to err in Points Fundamental, in which any private <hi>Reformer</hi> may fail: and therefore they could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any neceſſity to forſake that Church, out of whoſe Communion they were expoſed to danger of falling into many more, and even into damnable errors.

Moreover if (as you ſay) no Church may hope <hi>to triumph over all error till ſhe be in heaven;</hi> You muſt either grant, that errors not Fundamental cannot yield ſufficient cauſe to forſake the Church, or elſe you muſt affirm that all Community may, and ought to be forſaken, and ſo there will be no end of Schiſms: or rather indeed there can be no ſuch thing as Schiſm, becauſe, according to you, all communities are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to errors not Fundamental, for which, if they may be lawfully forſaken, it followeth clearly that it is not Schiſm to forſake them.

But no length of Time, no Quality of Perſons, no Circumſtance of Neceſſity can legitimate actions which are of their own nature unlawful: and therefore diviſion from Chriſts Myſtical Body, being of the number of thoſe Actions, which Divines teach to be <hi>intrinſecè malas, evil of their own nature and eſſence,</hi> no difference of Perſons or Time can ever make it lawful. D. <hi>Potter</hi> ſaith: <hi>There neither was, nor can be any cauſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the Church of Chriſt, no more than from Chriſt himſelf.</hi> And who dates ſay, that it is not damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>continue</hi> a Separation from Chriſt? <hi>Preſcription</hi> cannot in conſcience run, when the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and his ſucceſſors are conſcious that the thing to be <hi>preſcribed,</hi> for example, goods or lands, were unjuſtly poſſeſſed at the firſt.

Humane Laws may come to nothing by diſcontinuance of time, but the Law of God,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:64345:129"/>commanding us to conſerve Unity in his Church, doth ſtill remain. The continued diſobedience of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren cannot deprive Parents of their parental right, nor can the Grand-child be undutiful to his Grand-Father, becauſe his Father was unnatural to his own Parent. The longer Gods Church is ſo diſobeyed; the profeſſion of her Doctrin denyed; her Sacraments neglected; her Liturgy condemned; her Unity violated: the more grievous the fault grows to be: As the longer a man withholds a due debt, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his neighbours goods, the greater injuſtice he commits. Conſtancy in evil doth not extenuate, but aggravate the ſame, which by extenſion of time, receiveth increaſe of ſtrength, and addition of greater malice. If theſe mens conceits were true, the Church might come to be wholly divided by wicked Schiſms, and yet after ſome ſpace of time, none could be accuſed of Schiſm, nor be obliged to return to the viſible Church of Chriſt: and ſo there ſhould remain no one true viſible Church. Let therefore theſe men who pretend to honour, reverence, and believe the Doctrin, and practice of the Viſible Church, and to condemn their forefathers who forſook her, and ſay, They would not have done ſo, if they had lived in the dayes of their Fathers, and yet follow their example in remaining divided from her Communion; conſider how truly theſe words of our Saviour fall upon them, <hi>Woe be to you, becauſe you build</hi>

                           <hi>The ANSWER to the FIFTH CHAPTER.</hi> The ſeparation of Proteſtants from the Roman Church, being upon juſt and neceſſary cauſes, is not any way guilty of Schiſm.</head>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>
                              <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>D</hi> §. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. In the ſeven firſt Sections of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there be many things ſaid, and many things ſuppoſed by you which are untrue, and deſerve a cenſure. As,</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Firſt, <hi>That Schiſm could not be a Diviſion from the Church, or that a Diviſion from the Church could not happen, unleſs there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had been and ſhould be a viſible Church.</hi> Which Aſſertion is a manifeſt falſhood; For although there never had been any Church Viſible or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible before this Age, nor ſhould be ever after; yet this could not hinder, but that a Schiſm might now be, and be a Diviſion from the preſent viſible Church. As though in <hi>France</hi> there never had been until now a lawful Monarch, nor after him ever ſhould be; yet this hinders not, but that now there might be a Rebellion, and that Rebellion might be an Inſurrection againſt Soveraign Authority.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>That it is a point to be granted by all Chriſtians, that in all Ages there hath been a viſible Congregation of faithful people.</hi> Which Propoſition howſoever you underſtand it, is not abſolutely certain. But if you mean by <hi>Faithful,</hi> (as it is plain you do) <hi>free from all error in faith,</hi> then you know all Proteſtants with one conſent affirm it to be falſe; and therefore without proof to take it for granted is to beg the Queſtion.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>That ſuppoſing</hi> Luther <hi>and they which did firſt ſeparate from the Roman Church were guilty of Schiſm, it is certainly conſequent, that all who perſiſt in this Diviſion muſt be ſo likewiſe.</hi> Which is not ſo certain as you pretend. For they, which alter without neceſſary cauſe the preſent government of any State, Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, do commit a great fault; whereof notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they may be innocent who continue this alteration, and to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their power oppoſe a change though to the former State, when continuance of time hath once ſetled the preſent. Thus have I known ſome of your own Church, condemn the Low-countrey men who firſt revolted from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> of the ſin of Rebellion; yet abſolve them from it
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:64345:131"/>who now being of your Religion there, are yet faithful maintainers of the common liberty againſt the pretences of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. Fourthly, <hi>That all thoſe which a Chriſtian is to eſteem neighbours do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to make one company, which is the Church.</hi> Which is falſe: for a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is to eſteem thoſe his neighbours, who are not members of the true Church.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. Fifthly, <hi>That all the Members of the Viſible Church, are by charity uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into one Myſtical body.</hi> Which is manifeſtly untrue; for many of them have no Charity.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. Sixthly, <hi>That the Catholique Church ſignifies one company of faithful people,</hi> which is repugnant to your own grounds. For you require, not true Faith, but only the Profeſſion of it, to make men members of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Seventhly, <hi>That every Heretique is a Schiſmatique.</hi> Which you muſt acknowledge falſe in thoſe, who though they deny, or doubt of ſome Point profeſſed by your Church, and ſo are Heretiques; yet continue ſtill in the Communion of the Church.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. Eighthly, <hi>That all the Members of the Catholique Church, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity be united in external Communion.</hi> Which though it were much to be deſired it were ſo, yet certainly cannot be perpetually true. For a man unjuſtly excommmunicated, is not in the Churches Communion, yet he is ſtill a Member of the Church: and divers time it hath happened, as in the caſe of <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> that particular men, and particular Churches, have upon an overvalued difference, either renounced Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion mutually, or one of them ſeparated from the other, and yet both have continued Members of the Catholique Church. Theſe things are in thoſe <hi>ſeven Sections,</hi> either ſaid or ſuppoſed by you untruly, without all ſhew, or pretence of proof. The reſt is impertinent common place, wherein Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and the cauſe in hand, are abſolutely unconcern'd. And therefore I paſs to the <hi>eighth Section.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">10. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 8. Wherein you obtrude upon us a double Fallacy; One, in ſuppoſing and taking for granted, that whatſoever is affirmed by <hi>three Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> muſt be true; whereas your ſelves make no ſcruple of condemning many things of falſhood, which yet are maintained by more than thrice three Fathers. Another, in pretending their words to be ſpoken abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which by them are limited and reſtrained to ſome particular caſes. For whereas you ſay S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> c. 62. l. 2. <hi>cont. Parm.</hi> inferrs out of the former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>That there is no neceſsity to divide Unity:</hi> to let paſs your want of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, in quoting the 62. Chapter of that Book, which hath but 23. in it: to paſs by alſo, that theſe words which are indeed in the 11. Chapter, are not inferred out of any ſuch premiſes as you pretend; this, I ſay, is evident, that he ſays not abſolutely, that there never is, or can be any neceſſity to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Unity (which only were for your purpoſe,) but only in ſuch a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al caſe, as he there ſets down: That is, <hi>When good men tolerate bad men, which can do them no ſpiritual hurt, to the intent they may not be ſeparated from theſe, who are ſpiritually good; Then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is no neceſsity to divide Unity.</hi> Which very words do clearly give us to underſtand, that it may fall out (as it doth in our caſe,) that we cannot keep Unity with bad men, without ſpiritual hurt, <hi>i.e.</hi> without partaking with them in their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, and that then there is a neceſſity to divide Unity from them:
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:64345:131"/>I mean, to break off conjunction with them in their impieties. Which that it was <hi>S. Auſtin</hi>'s mind, it is moſt evident out of the 21. c. of the ſame Book: where, to <hi>Parmenian</hi> demanding, <hi>How can a man remain pure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned with thoſe that are corrupted?</hi> he anſwers, <hi>Very true, this is not poſsible, if he be joyned with them, that is, if he commit any evil with them, or favour them which do commit it. But if he do neither of theſe, he is not joyned with them.</hi> And preſently after, <hi>Theſe two things retained, will keep ſuch men pure and uncorrupted; that is, neither doing ill, nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving it.</hi> And therefore ſeeing you impoſe upon all men of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, a neceſſity of <hi>doing,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>approving</hi> many things unlawful, certainly there lies upon us an unavoidable neceſsity of dividing Unity, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with you, or with God; and whether of theſe is rather to be done, be ye Judges.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> alſo ſays not ſimply (which only would do you ſervice,) there cannot poſsibly be any ſo important Reformation, as to juſtifie a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from them who will not reform: But only, <hi>they cannot make any corruption ſo great, as is the pernitiouſneſs of a Schiſm:</hi> Now, <hi>They,</hi> here, is a relative, and hath an antecedent expreſſed in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> which, if you had been pleaſed to take notice of, you would eaſily have ſeen, that what <hi>Irae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus</hi> ſays, falls heavy upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but toucheth Proteſtants nothing at all. For the men he ſpeaks of, are ſuch as <hi>Propter modicas &amp; quaſlibet cauſas, for trifling or ſmall cauſes, divide the body of Chriſt; ſuch as ſpeak of peace, and make war; ſuch as ſtrain at gnats and ſwallow Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels. And theſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>can make no reformation of any ſuch importance, as to countervail the danger of a diviſion.</hi> Now, ſeeing the cauſes of our ſeparation from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are (as we pretend, and are ready to juſtifie,) becauſe we will not be partakers with her in Superſtition, Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Impiety, and moſt cruel Tyranny, both upon the bodies and ſouls of men, Who can ſay, that the cauſes of our ſeparation, may be juſtly eſteemed <hi>Modicae &amp; quaelibet cauſae?</hi> On the other ſide, ſeeing the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who was contemporary to <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> did (as much as in him lay) cut off from the Churches unity, many great Churches, for not conforming to him in an indifferent matter, upon a difference, <hi>Non de Catholico dogmate, ſed de Ritu, vel Ritus potiùs tempore; Not about any Catholique doctrine, but only a Ceremony, or rather about the time of obſerving it?</hi> ſo <hi>Petavius</hi> values it: which was juſt all one, as if the Church of <hi>France</hi> ſhould excommunicate thoſe of their own Religion in <hi>England,</hi> for not keeping Chriſtmas upon the ſame day with them. And ſeeing he was reprehended ſharply and bitterly for it, by moſt of the Biſhops of the world, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> teſtifies,<note place="margin">Euſeb. hiſt. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>24.</hi> Perron Replic. <hi>3.</hi> l. <hi>2.</hi> c.</note> and (as Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> though mincing the matter, yet confeſſeth) by this very <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renaeus</hi> himſelf in particular admoniſhed, that for ſo ſmall a cauſe <hi>(propter tam modicam cauſam,)</hi> he ſhould not have cut off ſo many Provinces from the body of the Church: and laſtly, ſeeing the Eccleſiaſtical Story of thoſe times, mentions no other notable example of any ſuch Schiſmatical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, but this of <hi>Victor;</hi> certainly we have great inducement to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in this place by you quoted, had a ſpecial aim at the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop and Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Once, this I am ſure of, that the place fits him, and many of his ſucceſſors, as well as if it had been made purpoſely for them. And this alſo, that be which finds fault with them <hi>who ſeparate upon ſmall cauſes,</hi> implies clearly, that he conceived, there might be ſuch cauſes
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64345:132"/>as were great and ſufficient: And that then a Reformation was to be made, notwithſtanding any danger of diviſion that might enſue upon it.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. Laſtly S. <hi>Denis</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſays indeed and very well, <hi>that all things ſhould be rather endured, than we ſhould conſent to the diviſion of the Church:</hi> I would add Rather than conſent to the continuation of the diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it might be remedied. But then, I am to tell you, that he ſays not, All things ſhould rather <hi>be done,</hi> but only, All things ſhould rather <hi>be endured or ſuffered:</hi> wherein he ſpeaks not of the evil of Sin, but of Pain and Miſery: Not of tolerating either Error or Sin in others (though that may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,) much leſs of joyning with others for quietneſs ſake, (which only were to your purpoſe) in the profeſſion of Error, and practice of Sin: but of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any affliction, nay even martyrdom in our own perſons, rather than conſent to the diviſion of the Church. <hi>Omnia incommoda,</hi> ſo your own <hi>Chriſto pherſon,</hi> enforced by the circumſtances of the place, tranſlates <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius</hi> his words, All <hi>miſeries ſhould rather be endured, than we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Churches diviſion.</hi>

                        <p n="13">13. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 9. In the next Paragraph you affirm two things, but prove neither, unleſs a vehement Aſſeveration, may paſs for a weak proof. You tell us firſt, <hi>That the Doctrin of the total deficiency of the viſible Church, which is maintained by divers chief Proteſtants, implies in it vaſt Abſurdity, or rather ſacrilegious Blaſphemy.</hi> But neither do the Proteſtants, alledged by you maintain the deficiency of the Viſible Church, but only of the Churches viſibility; or of the Church as it is Viſible, which ſo acute a man as you, now that you are minded of it, I hope, will eaſily diſtinguiſh: Neither do they hold, that the viſible Church hath failed totally and from its Eſſence, but only from its purity: and that it fell into many corruptions, but yet not to nothing. And yet if they had held, that there was not only no pure vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, but none at all: ſurely they had ſaid more than they could juſtifie; but yet they do not ſhew, neither can I diſcover, any ſuch <hi>Vaſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity or Sacrilegious Blaſphemy</hi> in this Aſſertion. You ſay ſecondly, that the <hi>Reaſon which caſt them upon this wicked Doctrin, was a deſperate volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary neceſsity, becauſe they were reſolved not to acknowledge the Roman to be the true Church, and were convinced by all manner of evidence, that for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Ages before</hi> Luther <hi>there was no other.</hi> But this is not to diſpute but to divine, and take upon you the property of God which is to know the hearts of men. For why, I pray, might not the Reaſon hereof rather be, becauſe they were convinced by all manner of evidence, as Scripture, Reaſon, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that all the viſible Churches in the world, but above all the Roman, had degenerated from the purity of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and thereupon did conclude there was no viſible Church, meaning by <hi>no Church, none free from corruption,</hi> and conformable in all things to the doctrin of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="14">14 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 10. Neither is there anyr epugnance (but in words only) between theſe as you are pleaſed to ſtile them, <hi>exterminating Spirits,</hi> &amp; thoſe other, whom out of Courteſie you intitle, in your 10. §. <hi>more moder<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>te Proteſtants.</hi> For theſe affirming the Perpetual Viſibility of the Church, yet neither deny, nor doubt of her being ſubject to manifold and grievous corruptions, and thoſe, of ſuch a nature, as, were they not mitigated by invincible, or at leaſt a very probable ignorance, none ſubject to them could be ſaved. And they, on the other ſide, denying the Churches Viſibility, yet plainly affirm, that they conceive very good hope of the Salvation of many, of their ignorant
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:64345:132"/>and honeſt Fore fathers. Thus declaring plainly, though in words they deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Viſibility of the true Church, yet their meaning was not to deny the perpetuity, but the perpetual purity &amp; incorruption of the Viſible Church.</p>
                        <p n="15">15. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 11. Let us proceed therefore to your 11. Section, where though D. <hi>Potter</hi> and other Proteſtants granting the Churches perpetual Viſibility, make it needleſs for you to prove it, yet you will needs be doing that which is needleſs. But you do it ſo coldly and negligently, that it is very happy for you, that D. <hi>Potter</hi> did grant it.</p>
                        <p n="16">16. For, <hi>What if the Prophets ſpake more obſcurely of Chriſt, than of the Church? What if they had fore-ſeen, that greater contentions would ariſe about the Church than Chriſt?</hi> Which yet, he that is not a meer ſtranger in the ſtory of the Church muſt needs know to be untrue, and therefore not to be fore-ſeen by the Prophets. What <hi>if we have manifeſtly received the Church from the Scriptures?</hi> Does it follow from any, or all theſe things, that the Church of Chriſt muſt be always viſible?</p>
                        <p n="17">17. Beſides, What Proteſtant ever granted (that which you preſume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo confidently,) that <hi>every man for all the affairs of his ſoul muſt have recourſe to ſome Congregation?</hi> If ſome one Chriſtan lived alone among Pagans in ſome Countrey, remote from Chriſtendom, ſhall we conceive it impoſſible for this man to be ſaved, becauſe he cannot have recourſe to any Congregation, for the affairs of his ſoul? will it not be ſufficient, for ſuch a ones ſalvation, to know the doctrin of Chriſt, and live according to it? Such fancies as theſe, you do very wiſely to take for granted, becauſe you know well, 'tis hard to prove them.</p>
                        <p n="18">18. Let it <hi>be as unlawful as you pleaſe, to deny and diſſemble matters of faith. Let them that do ſo, not be a Church, but a damned crew of Sycophants:</hi> What is this to the Viſibility of the Church? May not the Church be Inviſible, and yet theſe that are of it profeſs their faith? No, ſay you: Their profeſſion will make them viſible. Very true, viſible in the places where, and in the times when they live, and to thoſe perſons, unto whom they have neceſſary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to make their profeſſion: But not viſible to all, or any great, or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of the world while they live, much leſs conſpicuous to all ages after them. Now it is a Church thus illuſtriouſly and conſpicuouſly viſible that you require: by whoſe ſplendour all men may be directed and drawn to repair to her, for the affairs of their ſouls: Neither is it the Viſibility of the Church abſolutely, but this degree of it, which the moſt rigid Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants deny: which is plain enough out of the places of <hi>Napper,</hi> cited by you in your 9<hi rend="sup">•h</hi>. Part of this Chapter. Where his words are, <hi>God hath withdraw his viſible Church from open Aſſemblies, to the hearts of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar godly men.</hi> And this Church which had not open Aſſemblies, he calls <hi>The Latent and Inviſible Church.</hi> Now, I hope, Papiſts in <hi>England</hi> will be very apt to grant, men may be ſo farr Latent and Inviſible, as not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their faith in open Aſſemblies, nor to proclàim it to the world, and yet not deny, nor diſſemble it; nor deſerve to be eſteemed a <hi>damned crew of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p n="19">19. But, <hi>Preaching of the word, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but make a Church viſible: and theſe are inſeparable notes of the Church.</hi> I anſwer, they are ſo far inſeparable, that whereſoever they are, there a Church is: But not ſo, but that in ſome caſes there may be a Church, where theſe notes are not. Again, theſe notes will make the Church viſible:
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:64345:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>But to whom? Certainly not to all men, nor to moſt men: But to them only to whom the Word is preached, and the Sacraments are adminiſtred. They make the Church viſible, to whom themſelves are viſible, but not to others. As where your Sacraments are adminiſtred, and your Doctrin preached, it is viſible, that there is a Popiſh Church. But this may perhaps be viſible to them only, who are preſent at theſe performances, and to others as ſecret, as if they had never been performed.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. But <hi>S.</hi> Auſtin <hi>ſaith, It is an impudent, abominable, deteſtable ſpeech,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to ſay, The Church hath periſhed.</hi> I anſwer;
<list>
                              <item>1. All that S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays, is not true.</item>
                              <item>2. Though this were true, it were nothing to your purpoſe, unleſs you will conceive it all one, not to be, and not to be conſpicuouſly viſible.</item>
                              <item>3. This very ſpeech that the Church periſhed, might be falſe and impudent in the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and yet not ſo in the Proteſtants. For there is no incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that what hath lived 500 years, may periſh in 1600. But. <hi>S.</hi> Auſtin <hi>deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not only the actual periſhing,</hi> but <hi>the poſsibility of it:</hi>
                              </item>
                           </list> 
                           <hi>and not only of its falling</hi> to nothing, <hi>but of its falling into corruption.</hi> I anſwer: though no ſuch thing appears out of thoſe places, yet, I believe, heat of diſputation againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and a deſire to over-confute them, tranſported him ſo far, as to urge againſt them more than was neceſſary, and perhaps more than was true. But were he now revived, and did but confront the doctrin of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, with that; his own experience would enforce him to change his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As concerning the laſt ſpeech of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> I cannot but wonder very much, why he ſhould think it abſurd for any man to ſay, <hi>There are ſheep which he knows not, but God knows:</hi> and no leſs at you, for obtruding this ſentence upon us as pertinent proof of the Churches viſibility.</p>
                        <p n="21">21. Neither do I ſee, <hi>how the Truth of any preſent Church depends upon the Perpetual Viſibility, nay nor upon the perpetuity</hi> of that which is paſt or fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For what ſenſe is there, that it ſhould not be in the power of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, to reſtore to a flouriſhing eſtate, a Church which oppreſſion hath made Inviſible? to repair that which is ruined; to reform that which was corrupted, or to revive that which was dead? Nay, what Reaſon is there, but that by ordinary means this may be done, ſo long as the Scriptures by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence are preſerved in their Integrity and Authority? As a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth though never ſo far collapſed and over-run with diſorders, is yet in poſſibility of being reduc'd unto its Original ſtate, ſo long as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Laws, and Fundamental Conſtitutions are extant, and remain invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, from whence men may be directed how to make ſuch a Reformation. <hi>But S. Auſtine urges this very Argument againſt the Donatiſts, and therefore it is good.</hi> I anſwer, that I doubt much of the Conſequence, and my Reaſon is, becauſe you your ſelves acknowledge, that even General Councils (and therefore much more particular Doctors) though infallible in their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, are yet in their Reaſons and Arguments, whereupon they ground them, ſubject to like Paſſions and Errors with other men.</p>
                        <p n="22">22. Laſtly, whereas you ſay, <hi>That all Divines define Schiſm, A Diviſion from the true Church,</hi> and from thence collect, That <hi>there muſt be a known Church from which it is poſsible for men to depart:</hi> I might very juſtly queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Antecedent, and deſire you to conſider, whether Schiſm be not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or at leaſt be not as well a diviſion of the Church, as from it? A ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not of a part from the whole, but of ſome parts from the other. And if you liked not this definition, I might deſire you to inform me in thoſe many
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64345:133"/>Schiſms, which have hapned in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which of the parts was the Church, and which was divided from it. But to let this paſs, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly your conſequence is moſt unreaſonable. For though whenſoever there is a Schiſm, it muſt neceſſarily ſuppoſe a Church exiſtent there, yet ſure we may define a Schiſm that is, declare what the word ſignifies (for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining is no more) though at this preſent there were neither Schiſm nor Church in the world. Unleſs you will ſay, that we cannot tell what a Roſe is, or what the word Roſe ſignifies, but only in the Summer when we have Roſes: or that in the world to come, when men ſhall not marry, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to know, what it is to marry: or that the Plague is not a diſeaſe, but only when ſome body is infected: or that Adultery is not a ſin, unleſs there be Adulterers: or that before <hi>Adam</hi> had a Child, he knew not, and God could not have told him, what it was to be a Father. Certainly Sir, you have forgot your Metaphyſicks, which you ſo much glory in, if you know not, that the connexions of eſſential predicates with their ſubjects, are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and depend not at all upon the actual exiſtence of the thing defined. This definition therefore of Schiſm, concludes not the exiſtence of a Church, even when it is defined: much leſs the perpetual continuance of it, and leaſt of all the continuance of it in perpetual viſibility and purity, which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing that we deny, &amp; you are to prove. By this time, you perceive I hope, that I had reaſon to ſay, that it was well for you, that D. <hi>Potter</hi> granted the Churches perpetual Viſibility: for, for ought I can perceive, this Conceſſion of his, is the beſt ſtake in your hedge, the beſt piller upon which this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſtands; which yet is the only ground-work of your whole Accuſation.</p>
                        <p n="23">23. <hi>Ad</hi> § 12.47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55. The remainder of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to convince <hi>Luther,</hi> and all that follow him to be Schiſmatiques, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords us Arguments of two ſorts: the firſt drawn from the nature of the thing: the ſecond from D. <hi>Potters</hi> words and acknowledgements. So that the former if they be good, muſt be good againſt all Proteſtants: the later only againſt D. <hi>Potter.</hi> I will examin them all, and doubt not to make it appear even to your ſelf, if you have any indifference, that there is not any ſound and concluding reaſon amongſt them, but that they are all poor and miſerable Sophiſms.</p>
                        <p n="24">24 Firſt then to prove us Schiſmatiques, you urge from the nature of Schiſm this only Argument.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Whoſoever leave the external Communion of the viſible Church, are Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques: But</hi> Luther <hi>and his followers left the external Communion of the viſible Church of Chriſt. Therefore they are Schiſmatiques.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Major of this Syllogiſm you leave naked without proof; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, as it ſhould ſeem, able enough to ſhift for it ſelf. The Minor or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Propoſition of this Argument, you prove by two other. The firſt is this.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>They which forſook the external Communion of all viſible Churches, muſt needs forſake the external Communion of the true viſible Church of Chriſt: But</hi> Luther <hi>and his followers forſook the external Communion of all viſible Churches: Therefore they forſook the external Communion of the true viſible Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Major</hi> of this Syllogiſm you take for granted (as you have reaſon:) The <hi>Minor</hi> you proſecute with great pomp of words, and prove with plenty of Reaſons, built upon the confeſſions of D. <hi>Potter, Luther, Calvin,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proteſtants; and this you do in the 12 § of this Chapter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="234" facs="tcp:64345:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The ſecond Argument to prove the Aſſumption of your Syllogiſm, ſtands thus.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The</hi> Roman <hi>Church, when</hi> Luther <hi>and his followers made the ſeparation, was the true viſible Church of Chriſt: But</hi> Luther <hi>and his followers for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook the external Communion of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church: Therefore they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook the external Communion of the true viſible Church of Chriſt.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Aſſumption of this Syllogiſm needs no proof: the Propoſition which needs it very much, you endeavour to confirm by theſe Reaſons.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>The</hi> Roman <hi>Church had the notes of the Church aſsigned by Proteſtants.</hi> i.e. <hi>The true Preaching of the Word, and due adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: Therefore ſhe was the true Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Antecedent is proved: <hi>Becauſe D.</hi> Potter <hi>confeſſes ſhe wanted nothing Fundamental or neceſſary to ſalvation: Therefore for the Subſtance of the matter ſhe had theſe notes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Either the</hi> Roman <hi>Church was the true viſible Church, or Proteſtants can name and prove ſome other, diſagreeing from the</hi> Roman, <hi>and agreeing with Proteſtants, in their particular Doctrins; or elſe they muſt ſay, There was no viſible Church: But they will not ſay, There was no Church: They cannot name and prove any other diſagreeing from the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>and agreeing with Proteſtants, in their particular Doctrins: becauſe this cannot be the</hi> Greek <hi>Church, nor that of the</hi> Waldenſes, Wick i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites, Huſſites, <hi>nor that of the</hi> Muſcovites, Armenians, Georgians, Aethiopians, <hi>which you confirm by ſeveral Arguments: Therefore they muſt grant, that the</hi> Roman <hi>Church was the true viſible Church.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And this is the buſineſs of your 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of this Chapter.</p>
                        <p n="25">25. Now to all this, I anſwer very briefly thus: That you have played the unwiſe builder, and erected a ſtately ſtructure upon a falſe foundation. For whereas you take for granted as an undoubted Truth, <hi>That whoſoever leave the external communion of the viſible Church, are Schiſmatical,</hi> I tell you Sir, you preſume too much upon us, and would have us grant, that which is the main point in Queſtion. For either you ſuppoſe the external Communion of the Church corrupted, and that there was a neceſſity for them that would communicate with this Church to communicate in her cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions: Or you ſuppoſe her Communion uncorrupted. If the former, and yet will take for granted, that all Schiſmatiques, that leave her Communion though it be corrupted, you beg the Queſtion in your Propoſition. If the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you beg the Queſtion in your ſuppoſition; for Proteſtants, you know, are Peremptory and Unanimous in the Denial of both theſe things: Both that the Communion of the Viſible Church was then uncorrupted; And that they are truly Schiſmatiques, who leave the Communion of the Viſible Church, if corrupted; eſpecially, if the caſe be ſo (and <hi>Luther</hi>'s was ſo) that they muſt either leave her Communion, or of neceſſity Communicate with her in her corruptions. You will ſay perhaps, <hi>That you have already proved it impoſſible, that the Church, or her Communion ſhould be corrupted.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they are Schiſmatiques, who leave the external Communion of the viſible Church, becauſe ſhe cannot be corrupted. And that <hi>hereafter you will prove, that corruptions in the Churches Communion, though the belief &amp; profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them be made the condition of her communion, cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>uſtifie a ſeparation from it:</hi> &amp; therefore that they are ſchiſmaticks, who leave the Churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:64345:134"/>though corrupted. I anſwer, that I have examined your proofs of the former, and found that a vein of Sophiſtry runs clean through them: And for the later it is ſo plain and palpable a falſehood, that I cannot but be confident, whatſoever you bring in proof of it, will, like the Apples of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> fall to Aſhes upon the firſt touch. And this is my firſt and main excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt your former diſcourſe: that accuſing Proteſtants of a very great and horrible crime, you have proved your accuſation only with a Fallacy.</p>
                        <p n="26">26. Another is, that although it were granted Schiſm, to leave the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Communion of the viſible Church in what ſtate or caſe ſo ever it be, and that <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers were Schiſmatiques, for leaving the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Communion of all viſible Churches: yet you fail exceedingly of clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the other neceſſary point undertaken by you, <hi>That the Roman Church was then the Viſible Church.</hi> For neither do <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (as you miſtake) <hi>make the true preaching of the Word, and due adminiſtration of the Sacraments, the notes of the viſible Church,</hi> but only of a viſible Church: now theſe you know are very different things, the former ſignifying <hi>the Church Catholique,</hi> or the whole Church: the later a <hi>Particular Church,</hi> or a part of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique. And therefore, ſuppoſe out of curteſie, we ſhould grant, what by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument you can never evince, that your Church had theſe notes, yet would it by no means follow, that your Church were <hi>the Viſible Church,</hi> but only a <hi>Viſible Church:</hi> not the whole Catholique, but only a part of it. But then beſides, where doth D. <hi>Potter</hi> acknowledge any ſuch matter as you pretend? Where doth he ſay, that you had for the ſubſtance, <hi>the true Preaching of the Word,</hi> or <hi>due Adminiſtration of the Sacraments?</hi> Or where does he ſay, that (from which you collect this) <hi>you wanted nothing Fundamental, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation?</hi> He ſays indeed, that though your <hi>Errors were in themſelves damnable, and full of great impiety, yet he hopes, that thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, who were invincibly ignorant of the truth, might by Gods great mercy, have their errors pardoned, and their ſouls ſaved:</hi> And this is all he ſays, and this you confeſs to be all he ſays, in divers places of your Book: which is no more than you your ſelf do, and muſt affirm of Proteſtants: and yet I believe, you will not ſuffer us to inferr from hence, that you grant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants to have, for the ſubſtance, the true preaching of the Word, and due adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and want nothing fundamental or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation. And if we ſhould draw this conſequence from your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, certainly we ſhould do you injury, in regard many things may in themſelves, and in ordinary courſe be neceſſary to ſalvation, to thoſe that have means to attain them, as your Church generally hath: which yet, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, to theſe which were, by ſome impregnable impediment, debarred of theſe means, may by Gods mercy be made unneceſſary.</p>
                        <p n="27">27. Laſtly, whereas <hi>you ſay, that Proteſtants muſt either grant that your Church then was the viſible Church, or name ſome other, diſagreeing from yours and agreeing with Proteſtants in their particular doctrin, or acknowledge there was no viſible Church.</hi> It is all one, as if (to uſe S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſimilitude) the head ſhould ſay to the foot, Either you muſt grant that I am the whole body, or name ſome other member that is ſo, or confeſs that there is no body. To which the foot may anſwer; I acknowledge there is a body: and yet, that no member beſide you is this body: nor yet that you are it, but only a part of it. And in like manner ſay we, We acknowledge a Church there was, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted indeed univerſally; but yet ſuch a one as we hope by Gods gracious
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64345:135"/>acceptance, was ſtill a Church. We pretend not to name any one Society that was this Church; and yet we ſee no reaſon, that can inforce us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that yours was the Church, but only a part of it, and that one of the worſt then extant in the World. In vain therefore have you troubled your ſelf in proving, that we <hi>cannot pretend, that either the Greeks, Waldenſes, Wickliffites, Huſſites, Muſcovites, Armenians, Georgians, Abyſſines, were then the viſible Church.</hi> For all this diſcourſe proceeds upon a falſe and vain ſuppoſition, and begs another point in Queſtion between us, which is, that <hi>ſome Church of one denomination and one Communion</hi> (as the <hi>Roman,</hi> the <hi>Greek,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>muſt be always</hi> excluſively to all other Communions, <hi>the whole viſible Church.</hi> And though, perhaps ſome weak Proteſtant having this falſe principle ſetled in him, that there was to be always ſome Viſible Church of one denomination, pure from all error in doctrin, might be wrought upon, &amp; prevailed with by it, to forſake the <hi>Church</hi> of Proteſtants: yet why it ſhould induce him to go to yours, rather than the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, or any other, which pretends to perpetual ſucceſſion as well as yours, that I do not underſtand; unleſs it be for the reaſon which <hi>Aeneus Sylvius</hi> gave, why more held the Pope above a Council, than a Council above the Pope: which was becauſe <hi>Popes did give Biſhopricks and Archbiſhopricks, but Councils gave none,</hi> and therefore ſuing in <hi>Forma Pauperis,</hi> were not like to have their cauſe very well maintained. For put the caſe, I ſhould grant of meer favour, that there muſt be always ſome Church of one Denomination and Communion, free from all errours in doctrin, and that Proteſtants had not always ſuch a Church: it would follow indeed from thence, that I muſt not be a Proteſtant: But that I muſt be a Papiſt, certainly it would follow by no better conſequence than this; If you will leave <hi>England,</hi> you muſt of neceſſity go to <hi>Rome.</hi> And yet with this wretched Fallacy, have I been ſometimes abuſed my ſelf, and known many other poor ſouls ſeduced, not only from their own Church, and Religion, but unto yours. I beſeech God to open the eyes of all that love the truth, that they may not always be held captive, under ſuch miſerable deluſions.</p>
                        <p n="28">28. We ſee then, how unſucceſsful you have been in making good your accuſation, with reaſons drawn from the nature of the thing, and which may be urged in common againſt all Proteſtants. Let us come now to the Arguments of the other kind, which you build upon D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s own words, out of which you promiſe unanſwerable reaſons to convince Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of Schiſm.</p>
                        <p n="29">29. But let the underſtanding Reader, take with him but three or four ſhort Remembrances, and I dare ſay he ſhall find them upon examination, not only anſwerable, but already anſwered. The Memorandums I would commend to him, are theſe,</p>
                        <p n="30">30. 1. That not every ſeparation, but only a cauſeleſs ſeparation from the external Communion of any Church, is the Sin of Schiſm.</p>
                        <p n="31">31. 2. That, Impoſing upon men under pain of Excommunication a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of profeſſing known errours, and practiſing known corruptions, is a ſufficient and neceſſary cauſe of ſeparation: and that this is the cauſe which Proteſtants alleage to juſtifie their ſeparation from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="32">32. 3. That to leave the Church, and to leave the external Communion of a Church, at leaſt as D. <hi>Potter</hi> underſtands the words, is not the ſame thing: That being done, by ceaſing to be a member of it, by ceaſing to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:64345:135"/>have thoſe requiſites which conſtitute a man a member of it, as faith and Obedience: This, by refuſing to communicate with any Church in her Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies and publike worſhip of God. This little Armour if it be rightly placed, I am perſwaded, will repel all thoſe Batteries which you threaten ſhall be ſo furious.</p>
                        <p n="33">33. <hi>Ad</hi> § 13, 14, 15. The firſt is a ſentence of S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> againſt <hi>Donatus,</hi> applyed to <hi>Luther</hi> thus. <hi>If the Church periſhed; what Church brought forth Donatus,</hi> (you ſay Luther)? <hi>If ſhe could not periſh, what madneſs moved the ſect of Donatus to ſeparate, upon pretence to avoyd the Communion of bad men?</hi> Whereunto, one fair anſwer (to let paſs many others) is obvious out of the ſecond obſervation: That this ſentence though it were Goſpel, as it is not, is impertinently applyed to <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Lutherans,</hi> whoſe pretence of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration (be it true, or be it falſe,) was not (as that of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi>) only to avoid the Communion of bad men: but to free themſelves from a neceſſity (which but by ſeparating was unavoidable,) of joyning with bad men in their impieties. And your not ſubſtituting <hi>Luther</hi> inſtead of <hi>Donatus</hi> in the later part of the Dilemma as well as in the former, would make a ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man conjecture that you your ſelf took notice of this exception of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparity between <hi>Donatus</hi> and <hi>Luther.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="34">34. <hi>Ad</hi> § 16. Your ſecond onſet drives only at thoſe Proteſtants, who <hi>hold the true Church was inviſible for many ages.</hi> Which Doctrin (if by the <hi>true Church</hi> be underſtood, <hi>the pure Church,</hi> as you do underſtand it) is a certain truth, and it is eaſier for you to declaim (as you do) than to diſpute againſt it. But <hi>theſe men you ſay muſt be Heretiques, becauſe they ſeparated from the Communion of the viſible Church: and therefore alſo from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of that which they ſay was inviſible: In as much as the inviſible Church communicated with the viſible.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="35">35. <hi>Anſw.</hi> I might very juſtly deſire ſome proof of that which ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently you take for granted: That, there were no perſecuted and oppreſſed maintainers of the Truth in the days of our Fore-fathers, but only ſuch as diſſembled their opinions, and lived in your Communion. And truly if I ſhould ſay, there were many of this condition, I ſuppoſe, I could make my Affirmative much more probable, than you can make your Negative. We read in Scripture, that <hi>Elias</hi> conceived <hi>There was none left beſide himſelf in the whole Kingdom of Iſrael,</hi> who had not revolted from God: and yet God himſelf aſſures us that he was deceived. And if ſuch a man, a Prophet, and one of the greateſt, erred in his judgment touching his own time, and his own countrey, why may not you, who are certainly but a man, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the ſame paſſions as <hi>Elias</hi> was, miſtake in thinking, that in former ages, in ſome countrey or other, there were not always ſome good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which did not ſo much as externally bow their knees to your <hi>Baal?</hi> But this anſwer I am content you ſhall take no notice of, and think it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to tell you, that if it be true that this ſuppoſed inviſible Church did hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritically communicate with the viſible Church, in her corruptions, then Proteſtants had cauſe, nay, neceſſity, to forſake their Communion alſo; for otherwiſe they muſt have joyn'd with them in the practiſe of impieties: and ſeeing they had ſuch cauſe to ſeparate, they preſume their ſeparation cannot be ſchiſmatical.</p>
                        <p n="36">36. Yes, you reply, <hi>To forſake the external Communion of them with whom they agree in faith, is the moſt formal and proper ſin of Schiſm.</hi>
                           <pb n="238" facs="tcp:64345:136"/>Anſw. Very true, but I would fain know <hi>wherein.</hi> I would gladly be informed, whether I be bound, for fear of Schiſm, to communicate with thoſe that believe as I do, only in lawful things, or abſolutely in every thing: whether I am to joyn with them in ſuperſtition and Idolatry, and not only in a common profeſſion of the faith wherein we agree, but in a common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation or abjuration of it. This is that which you would have them do, or elſe, forſooth, they muſt be Schiſmatiques. But hereafter, I pray you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that there is no neceſſity of communicating even with true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in wicked actions. Nay, that there is a neceſſity herein to ſeparate from them. And then I dare ſay, even you being their judge, the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of their cauſe to ſeparate ſhall, according to my firſt obſervation, juſtifie their ſeparation from being ſchiſmatical.</p>
                        <p n="37">37. Arg. <hi>But the property of Schiſm, according to D.</hi> Potter, <hi>is to cut off from the hope of ſalvation, the Church from which it ſeparates: And theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants have this property, Therefore they are Schiſmatiques.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="38">38. Anſ. I deny the Syllogiſm, it is no better than this:
<q>
                              <l>One Sympton of the Plague is a Feaver,</l>
                              <l>But ſuch a man hath a Feaver,</l>
                              <l>Therefore he hath the Plague.</l>
                           </q>
                        </p>
                        <p>The true Concluſion which iſſues out of theſe Premiſſes, ſhould be this, Therefore he hath one Sympton of the Plague. And ſo likewiſe in the former, Therefore they have one property or one quality of Schiſmatiques. And as in the former inſtance, The man that hath one ſign of the Plague, may by reaſon of the abſence of other requiſites, not have the plague: So theſe Proteſtants may have ſomething of Schiſmatiques, and yet not be Schiſmatiques. A Tyrant ſentencing a man to death for his pleaſure, and a juſt judge that condemns a malefactor, do both ſentence a man to death, and ſo for the matter do both the ſame thing: yet the one does wickedly, the other juſtly. What's the reaſon? becauſe the one hath cauſe, the other hath not. In like manner Schiſmatiques, either always or generally denounce damnation to them from whom they ſeparate. The ſame do theſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and yet are not Schiſmatiques. The reaſon: becauſe Schiſmatiques do it, and do it without cauſe, and Proteſtants have cauſe for what they do. The impieties of your Church, being, generally ſpeaking, damnable; unleſs where they are excus'd by ignorance, and expiated at leaſt by a general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. In fine, though perhaps it may be true, that all Schiſmatiques do ſo: yet univerſal affirmatives are not converted, and therefore it follows not by any good Logick, that all that do ſo, when there is juſt cauſe for it, muſt be Schiſmatiques. The cauſe in this matter of ſeparation is all in all, and that for ought I ſee, you never think of. But <hi>if theſe rigid Proteſtants have juſt cauſe to cut off your Church from the hope of ſalvation: How can the milder ſort allow hope of Salvation to the Members of this Church?</hi> Anſ. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the quality of the Perſons cenſur'd, and this ſeeming repugnance of their cenſures will vaniſh into nothing. For your Church may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered either in regard of thoſe, in whom, either negligence, or pride, or worldly fear, or hopes, or ſome other voluntary ſin, is the cauſe of their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, which I fear is the caſe of the generality of men amongſt you: or in regard of thoſe who owe their Errours from Truth, to want of capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, or default of inſtruction; either in reſpect of thoſe that might know the truth and will not, or of thoſe who would know the truth, but (all
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64345:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>things conſidered) cannot: In reſpect of thoſe that have eyes to ſee, and will not ſee; or thoſe that would gladly ſee, but want eyes, or light. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the former ſort of men, (which your more rigid cenſures ſeem eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to reflect upon,) and the heavieſt ſentence will not be too heavy. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the later, and the mildeſt will not be too mild. So that here is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence but in words only, neither are you flatter'd by the one, nor uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably cenſur'd by the other.</p>
                        <p n="39">39. Your next blow is directed againſt the milder ſort of Proteſtants, <hi>who (you ſay) involve themſelves in the ſin of Schiſm by communicating with thoſe (as you call them) exterminating Spirits, whom you conceive your ſelf to have proved Schiſmatiques:</hi> And now load them further with the crime of Hereſie. For, ſay you, <hi>If you held your ſelves obliged under pain of damnation, to forſake the Communion of the Roman-Church by reaſon of her Errours, which yet you confeſs were not fundamental: ſhall it not be much more damnable, to live in confraternity with theſe, who defend an Errour of the failing of the Church, which in the</hi> Donatiſts <hi>you confeſs to have been properly Heretical?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="40">40. <hi>Anſw.</hi> You miſtake, in thinking that Proteſtants hold themſelves obliged not to communicate with you, only or principally by reaſon of your Errours and Corruption. For the true reaſon according to my third Obſervation, is not ſo much becauſe you <hi>maintain</hi> Errours and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as becauſe you <hi>impoſe</hi> them: and will allow your Communion to none but to thoſe that will hold them with you; and have ſo ordered your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, that either we muſt communicate with you in theſe things, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And for this very reaſon, though it were granted, that theſe Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants held this Doctrin which you impute to them; And though this Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour were as damnable, and as much againſt the Creed as you pretend: Yet, after all this, this-parity between you and them, might make it more lawful for us to communicate with them than you: becauſe what they hold, they hold to themſelves, and refuſe not (as you do) to communicate with them that hold the contrary.</p>
                        <p n="41">41. Thus we may anſwer your Argument, though both your former Suppoſitions were granted. But then for a ſecond anſwer, I am to tell you, that there is no neceſſity of granting either of them. For neither do theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants hold the failing of the Church from its being, but only from its viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility: which if you conceive all one, then muſt you conceive that the Stars fail every day, and the Sun every night. Neither is it certain that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the Churches failing is repugnant to the Creed. For as the truth of the Article of the remiſſion of ſins, depends not upon the actual remiſſion of any mans ſins, but upon Gods readineſs and reſolution to forgive the ſins of all that believe and repent; ſo that although unbelief or impenitence ſhould be univerſal, and <hi>the Faithful ſhould</hi> abſolutely <hi>fail from the children of men,</hi> and <hi>the Son of Man ſhould find no faith on the earth;</hi> yet ſhould the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle ſtill continue true, that God would forgive the ſins of all that repent: In like manner: It is not certain that the truth of the Article of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church, depends upon the actual exiſtence of a Catholique Church; but rather upon the right, that the Church of Chriſt, or rather (to ſpeak properly) the Goſpel of Chriſt hath to be univerſally believed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Article may be true, though there were no Church in the world. In regard, this notwithſtanding, it remains ſtill true, that there ought to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64345:137"/>be a Church, and this Church ought to be Catholique. For as, of theſe two Propoſitions, There is a Church in <hi>America,</hi> and, There ſhould be a Church in <hi>America,</hi> the truth of the later depends not upon truth of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſo neither does it in theſe two: There is a Church diffuſed all the world over, and, There ſhould be a Church diffuſed all the world over.</p>
                        <p n="42">42. Thirdly, if you underſtand by errors <hi>not fundamental,</hi> ſuch as are <hi>not damnable,</hi> it is not true, as I have often told you, that we confeſs your errors not fundamental.</p>
                        <p n="43">43. Laſtly, for your deſire that I ſhould here apply an authority of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> alleaged in your next number I would have done ſo very willingly, but indeed I know not how to do it: for in my apprehenſion it hath no more to do with your preſent buſineſs of proving it unlawful, to communicate with theſe men, who hold the Church was not alwayes viſible, than <hi>In nova fert animus.</hi> Beſides, I am here again to remember you, that St. <hi>Cyprians</hi> words, were they never ſo pertinent, yet are by neither of the parts litigant eſteemed any <hi>rule of faith.</hi> And therefore the urging of them, and ſuch like authorities, ſerves only to make Books great, and Controverſies endleſs.</p>
                        <p n="44">44. <hi>Ad</hi> § 17. The next Section in three long leaves, delivers us this ſhort ſenſe. <hi>That thoſe Proteſtants which ſay they have not left the Churches exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Communion, but only her corruptions, pretend to do that which is impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Becauſe theſe corruptions were inherent in the Churches external Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: and therefore he that forſakes them, cannot but forſake this.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="45">45. Anſ. But, Who are they that pretend, they forſook the Churches cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and not her external communion? Some there be that ſay, they have not left the Church, that is, not ceaſed to be members of the Church, but only left her corruptions: ſome, that they have not left the communion, but the corruptions of it; meaning the internal communion of it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with it, by faith and obedience: which diſagree from the former only in the maner of ſpeaking: for he that is in the Church, is in this kind of communion with it: and he that is not in this internal communion, is not in the Church. Some perhaps, that they left not your external commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in all things; meaning, that they left it not voluntarily being not <hi>fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivi</hi> but <hi>fugati,</hi>

And if perhaps you were led into error, by thinking that to leave the Church, and to leave the external communion of it, was all one in ſenſe and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, I hope by this time you are diſabus'd and begin to underſtand, that as a man may leave any faſhion or cuſtome of a Colledge, and yet remain ſtill a member of the Colledge; ſo a man may poſſibly leave ſome opinion or practice of a Church, formerly common to himſelf and others, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtill a member of that Church: Provided that what he forſakes be not one of thoſe things, wherin the eſſence of the Church conſiſts. Wheras per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:64345:137"/>this practiſe may be ſo involved with the external communion of this Church, that it may be ſimply impoſſible, for him to leave this practiſe, and not to leave the Churches external communion.</p>
                        <p n="46">46 You will reply perhaps, <hi>That the difficulty lies as well againſt thoſe who pretend to forſake the Churches corruptions and not the Church, as againſt thoſe who ſay, they forſook the Churches corruptions and not her external com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. And that the reaſon is ſtill the ſame: becauſe theſe ſuppoſed corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were inherent in the whole Church, and therefore, by like reaſon with the former, could not be forſaken, but if the whole Church were forſaken.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="47">47. Anſ. A pretty Sophiſm, and very fit to perſwade men that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them, to forſake any error they hold, or any vice they are ſubject to, either peculiar to themſelves, or in common with others: Becauſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, they cannot forſake Themſelves; and Vices and Errors are things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in themſelves. The deceit lies, in not diſtinguiſhing between a Local and a Moral forſaking of any thing. For as it were an abſurdity, fit for the maintainers of Tranſubſtantiation to defend, that a man may Locally and properly depart from the Accidents of a ſubject, and not from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it ſelf: So is it alſo againſt reaſon to deny, that a man may (by an uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe phraſe of ſpeech) forſake any cuſtom or quality, good or bad, either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to himſelf, or common to himſelf with any company, and yet never truly or properly forſake either his company or himſelf. Thus if all the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits in the Society, were given to write Sophiſtically, yet you might leave this ill cuſtom, and yet not leave your Society. If all the Citizens of a City, were addicted to any vanity, they might, either all, or ſome of them, forſake it, and yet not forſake the City. If all the parts of a mans body were dirty or filthy, nothing hinders but that all or ſome of them might clenſe themſelves, and yet continue parts of the body. And what reaſon then in the world is there, if the whole Viſible Church were over-run with tares and weeds of ſuperſtitions, and corruptions, but that ſome members of it might reform themſelves, and yet continue ſtill true members of the body of the Church, and not be made no members, but the better by their Reformation? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is ſo obvious and ſenſible a Truth, that this thing is poſſible, that no man in his wits, will be perſwaded out of it, with all the Quirks &amp; Metaphyſicks in the world. Neither is this to ſay, <hi>that a man may keep company with</hi> Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Potter, <hi>and not keep company with the</hi> Provoſt of Qu. Colledge: <hi>Nor that a man can avoid the company of a ſinner, and at the ſame time be really preſent with the man who is the ſinner:</hi> which we leave to thoſe Proteſtants of your invention, who are ſo fooliſh, as to pretend, that a man may really ſeparate himſelf from the Churches external Communion as ſhe is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and yet continue in that Churches external Communion, which in this external Communion is corrupted. But we, that ſay only the whole Church being corrupted, ſome parts of it might and did reform themſelves, and yet might and did continue parts of the Church, though ſeparated from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal communion of the other parts, which would not reform, need not trouble our ſelves to reconcile any ſuch repugnance. For the caſe put by you, of keeping D. <hi>Potters</hi> company, and leaving the company of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt of Queens Colledge;</hi> and of leaving a ſinners company, and not the mans: are nothing at all like ours. But if you would ſpeak to the point, you muſt ſhew, that D. <hi>Potter</hi> cannot leave being <hi>Provoſt of Q. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> without ceaſing to be himſelf: or, that a ſinner cannot leave his ſin,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64345:138"/>without ceaſing to be a man: or that he that is part of any ſociety, cannot renounce any Vice of that ſociety, but he muſt relinquiſh the ſociety. If you would ſhew any of theſe things, then indeed (I dare promiſe) you ſhall find us apt enough to believe, that the particular parts of the viſible Church could not reform themſelves, but they muſt of neceſſity become no parts of it. But until we ſee this done, you muſt pardon us, if we chooſe to believe ſenſe rather than Sophiſtry.</p>
                        <p n="48">48. In this Paragraph you bring in the ſentence of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> whereto you refer'd us in the former: but, Why, in a controverſie of faith, do you cite any thing, which is confeſſed on all hands, not to be a rule of faith? Beſides, in my apprehenſion, this ſentence of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> is, in this place, and to this purpoſe, meerly impertinent. S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> words are, <hi>The Church</hi> (he ſpeaks of the particular Church, or Dioceſs of <hi>Rome</hi>) <hi>being one, cannot be within and without: If ſhe be with</hi> Novatianus, <hi>ſhe was not with</hi> Cornelius: <hi>But if ſhe were with</hi> Cornelius <hi>who ſucceeded</hi> Fabianus <hi>by lawful Ordination,</hi> Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus <hi>is not in the Church.</hi> And now, having related the words, I am on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to remember the Reader, that your buſineſs was to prove it <hi>impoſsible, For a man to forſake the Churches corruptions and not the Church,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt him to tell me Whether, as I ſaid, <hi>In nova fert animus,</hi> had not been as much to the purpoſe?</p>
                        <p n="49">49. Toward the concluſion of this Section, you <hi>number up your Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and tell us, That out of your diſcourſe it remaineth cleer, that this our chiefeſt Anſwer changeth the very ſtate of the Queſtion: confoundeth internal Acts of the underſtanding, with external dieds: doth not diſtinguiſh between Schiſm and Hereſie, and leaves this demonſtrated againſt us, that they (Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants) divided themſelves from the communion of the Viſible Catholique Church, becauſe they conceived that ſhe needed Reformation.</hi> To which Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, if any reply be needful, then briefly thus: We do not change the ſtate of the Queſtion, but you miſtake it. For the Queſtion was not, Whether they might forſake the corruptions of the Church, and continue in her exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal communion, which we confeſs impoſſible, becauſe theſe corruptions were in her communion: But the Queſtion was, Whether they might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake ſake the corruptions of the Church, and not the Church, but continue ſtill the members of it. And to this Queſtion, there is not in your whole diſcourſe one pertinent ſyllable.</p>
                        <p n="50">50. We <hi>do not confound internal Acts of underſtanding with external deeds,</hi> but acknowledge (as you would have us) that <hi>we cannot</hi> (as matters now ſtand) <hi>ſeparate from your corruptions, but we muſt depart from your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal communion.</hi> For you have ſo ordered things, that whoſoever will Communicate with you at all, muſt communicate with you, in your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. But it is you that will not perceive the difference, between, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part of the Church, and being in external Communion with all the other parts of it: taking for granted, that which is certainly falſe, that no two Men or Churches, divided in external communion, can be both true parts of the Catholique Church.</p>
                        <p n="51">51. We are not <hi>to learn the difference between Schiſm and Hereſie,</hi> for Hereſie we conceive, An obſtinate defence of any error againſt any neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Article of the Chriſtian faith: and Schiſm, A cauſleſs ſeparation of one part of the Church from another. But this we ſay, That if we convince you of errors, and corruptions, profeſſed and practiſed in your Communion,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:64345:138"/>then we cannot be Schiſmaticks, for refuſing to joyn with you in the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe Errors, and the practiſe of theſe corruptions. And therefore you muſt free either us from Schiſm, or your ſelves from error: at leaſt from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the profeſſion of it as a condition of your communion.</p>
                        <p n="52">52. Laſtly, whereas you ſay, <hi>That you have demonſtrated againſt us, that Proteſtants divided themſelves from the external communion of the Viſible Church,</hi> add, <hi>which external communion was corrupted,</hi> and we ſhall confeſs the accuſation, and glory in it. But this is not that <hi>Quod erat demonſtrandum,</hi> but that we divided our ſelves from the Church, that is, made our ſelves out-lawes from it, and no members of it. And moreover, in the Reaſon of our ſeparation from the external communion of your Church you are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken: for it was not ſo much becauſe ſhe, your Church, as becauſe your Churches external communion, was corrupted, and needed Reformation.</p>
                        <p n="53">53. <hi>That a pretence of Reformation will acquit no man from Schiſm,</hi> we grant very willingly, and therefore ſay, that it concernes every man who ſeparates from any Churches communion, even as much as his Salvation is worth, to look moſt carefully to it, that the cauſe of his ſeparation be juſt and neceſſary: For unleſs it be neceſſary, it can very hardly be ſufficient. But whether a true Reformation of our ſelves from errors, ſuperſtition, and impieties, will not juſtifie our ſeparation in theſe things; our ſeparation, I ſay, from them who will not reform themſelves, and, as much as in them lies, hinder others from doing ſo: This is the point you ſhould have ſpoken to, but have not. As for the ſentences of the Fathers to which you refer us, for the determination of this Queſtion, I ſuppoſe by what I have ſaid above, the Reader underſtands, by alleadging them you have gain'd little credit to your cauſe or perſon. And that, if they were competent Judges of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, their ſentence is againſt you much rather than for you.</p>
                        <p n="54">54. Laſtly, <hi>whereas you deſire</hi> D. Potter <hi>to remember his own words: There neither was nor can be any juſt cauſe to depart from the Church of Chriſt, no more than from Chriſt himſelf, and pretend that you have ſhewed that</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>did ſo:</hi> The Doctor remembers his words very well, and hath no reaſon to be aſhamed of them. Only he deſires you to remember that hereafter you do not confound, as hitherto you have done, Departing from the Church (<hi>i.e.</hi> ceaſing to be a member of it,) with departing from the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es external communion; and then he is perſwaded it will appear to you, that againſt <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers you have ſaid many things, but ſhewed nothing.</p>
                        <p n="55">55. But <hi>the Church Univerſal, remaining the Church Univerſal, according to D.</hi> Potter <hi>may fall into error: And from hence it cleerly followes, that it is impoſsible to leave the external communion of the Church ſo corrupted, and retain external communion with the Catholique Church.</hi> Anſ. The reaſon of this conſequence which you ſay is ſo cleer, truly I cannot poſſibly diſcern; But the concluſion inferr'd, me-thinks, is evident of it ſelf, and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proof I grant it. I mean, that it is impoſſible to leave the external com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Catholique Church corrupted, and to retain external com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Catholique Church. But what uſe you can make of it, I do not underſtand: Unleſs you will pretend, that to ſay a man may forſake the Churches corruptions, and not the Church, is all one as to ſay, he may forſake the Churches external communion and not forſake it. If you mean ſo, ſure you miſtake the meaning of Proteſtants when they ſay, They forſook
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:64345:139"/>not the Church but her corruptions. For in ſaying ſo, they neither affirm, nor deny that they forſook the external communion of the Church, nor ſpeak at all of it: But they mean only, that they ceaſed not to be ſtill members of the Church, though they ceaſed to believe and practiſe ſome things which the whole Church formerly did believe and practiſe. And as for the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Communion of the Viſible Church, we have without ſcruple formerly granted, that Proteſtants did forſake it, that is, renounce the practice of ſome obſervances, in which the whole Viſible Church before them did communicate. But this we ſay they did without Schiſm, becauſe they had cauſe to do ſo, and no man can have cauſe to be a Schiſmatique,</p>
                        <p n="56">56. But your Argument you conceive, will be more convincing, <hi>if we conſider that when</hi> Luther <hi>appeared, there were not two diſtinct Viſible true Churches, one Pure, the other Corrupted, but one Church only.</hi> Anſ. The ground ſay, Hiſtories are ſilent of any ſuch matter; I anſwer, there is no neceſſity, that you or I ſhould have read all Hiſtories, that may be extant of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; nor that all ſhould be extant that were written, much leſs extant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted: eſpecially, conſidering your Church, which had lately all the power in her hands, hath been ſo pernitiouſly induſtrious, in corrupting the monuments of Antiquity that made againſt her; nor that all Records ſhould remain which were written; nor that all ſhould be recorded which was done. Neither ſecondly, to ſuppoſe a Viſible Church before <hi>Luther,</hi> which did not err, is it to contradict this ground of D. <hi>Potters,</hi> that the Church may err. Unleſs you will have us believe, that, <hi>May be,</hi> and <hi>Muſt be</hi> is all one, and that all which may be true, is true: which rule if it were true, then ſure all men would be honeſt, becauſe all men may be ſo; and you would not make ſo bad Arguments, unleſs you will pretend, you cannot make better. Nor thirdly, is it to contradict theſe words, <hi>The Church may not hope to triumph over all error, till ſhe be in Heaven:</hi> For to triumph over error is to be ſecure from it, to be out of danger of it, not to be obnoxious to it. Now a Church may be free from error, and yet not ſecure from it, and conſequently in this <hi>Proteſtants, that</hi> Luther <hi>reformed the whole Church;</hi> perhaps (though I know not who they be that ſay ſo,) by a frequent Synecdoche, they may mean by the whole the greateſt, and moſt illuſtrious part of it, the luſtre whereof did much obſcure the other, though it were not wholly inviſible. Beſides, if their brag be evacuated, (as you call it) let it be ſo, I ſee no harm will come of it. Laſtly whereas you ſay, that ſuppoſing a viſible pure Church, <hi>Luther</hi> muſt be a Schiſmatick who ſeparated from all viſible Churches: I tell you, if you will ſuppoſe a viſible Church extant before and when <hi>Luther</hi> aroſe, conformable to him in all points of doctrin, neceſſary and profitable, then <hi>Luther</hi> ſeparated not from this Church, but adjoyned himſelf to it: Not indeed in place, which was not neceſſary, not in external communion which was impoſſible, but by the Union of faith and charity. Upon theſe grounds, I ſay, that the ground of this Argument is no way made certain; yet becauſe it is not manifeſtly falſe, I am content to let it paſs. And, for ought I ſee, it is very ſafe for me to do ſo: for you build nothing upon it which I may not fairly grant. For what do you rupted, <hi>Luther</hi> forſaking the external communion of the corrupted C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>urch, could not but forſake the external communion of the Catholique Church?
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:64345:139"/>Well, let this alſo be granted, what will come of it? What, that <hi>Luther</hi> muſt be a Schiſmatique? By no means: For not every ſeparation, but only a cauſleſs ſeparation from the communion of the Church we maintain to be Schiſmatical. Hereunto may be added, that though the whole Church were corrupted, yet properly ſpeaking, it is not true, that <hi>Luther</hi> and his Followers forſook the whole corrupted Church, or the external communion of it: But only that he forſook that Part of it which was corrupted, and ſtill would be ſo, and forſook not, but only reformed another Part, which Part they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were, and I ſuppoſe you will not go about to perſuade us, that they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook themſelves or their own communion. And if you urge, that they joyned themſelves to no other part, therefore they ſeparated from the whole: I ſay, it follows not, in as much as themſelves were a part of it, and ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo: and therefore could no more ſeparate from the whole than from themſelves. Thus though there were no part of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> to whom the <hi>Plebeians</hi> joyned themſelves, when they made their Seceſſion into the Aventine Hill; yet they divided themſelves from the <hi>Patricians</hi> only and not from the whole people, becauſe themſelves were a part of this people, and they divided not from themſelves.</p>
                        <p n="57">57. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 18. In the 18. §. you prove that which no man denies, that <hi>Corruption in manners yeelds no ſufficient cauſe to leave the Church:</hi> yet ſure, it yields ſufficient cauſe to caſt them out of the Church, that are, after the Churches publique admonition, obſtinate in notorious impieties. Neither doth the cutting off ſuch men from the Church, lay any neceſſary upon us, either to go out of the world, or out of the Church, but rather puts theſe men out of the Church into the world, where we may converſe with them freely, without ſcandal to the Church. <hi>Our bleſſed Saviour foretold,</hi> you ſay, <hi>that there ſhould be in the Church tares with choiſe corn.</hi> Look again, I pray, and you ſhall ſee, that the field he ſpeaks of, is not the Church, but <hi>the world:</hi> and therefore neither do you obey our Saviour's command, Let <hi>both grow up till the harveſt,</hi> who teach it to be lawfull to root theſe tares (ſuch are Heretiques) out of the world: neither do Proteſtants diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey it, if they eject manifeſt Hreretiques and notorious ſinners out of the Church.</p>

For if the error be not damnable, the belief thereof cannot. Anſ. D. <hi>Potter</hi> confeſſeth no ſuch matter: but only that <hi>he hopes that your errors though in themſelves ſufficiently damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet by accident did not damn all that held them:</hi> ſuch he means and ſaies, as were excuſably ignorant of the Truth, and amongſt the number of their unknown ſins, repented daily of their unknown errors. The truth is, he thinks as ill of your errors and their deſert, as you do of ours: only he is not ſo peremptory and preſumptuous in judging your perſons, as you are in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ours, but leaves them to ſtand or fall to their own Maſters, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely merciful, and therefore will not damn them for meer errors, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to find the truth and cannot: and withal infinitely juſt, and therefore (it is to be feared) will not pardon them, who might eaſily have come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:64345:140"/>of the truth, and either through Pride, or Obſtinacie, or Negligence would not.</p>
                        <p n="59">59. To your minor alſo, I anſwer almoſt in your own words, §. 42. of this Chap. <hi>I thank you for your courteous</hi> Suppoſal, that your Church may erre, and <hi>in recompence thereof, will do you a charity, by putting you in mind, into what Labyrinths you caſt your ſelf,</hi> by ſuppoſing that the Church may erre in ſome of her Propoſals, and yet denying it lawful for any man though he know this, which you ſuppoſe, to oppoſe her judgement, or leave her communion. <hi>Will you have ſuch a man diſſemble againſt his conſcience, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally deny that which he knows true?</hi> No, that you will not for them that do ſo, you your ſelf have pronouced a damned crew of diſſembling Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants. Or would you have him continue in your Communion, and yet profeſs your Church to erre? This you your ſelves have made to him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. Or would you have him believe thoſe things true, which together profeſs your Church to erre? This you your ſelves have made to him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. Or would you have him believe thoſe things true, which together with him you have ſuppoſed to be Errors? This is ſuch a one, as is aſſur'd or perſwaded of that, which you here ſuppoſe, that your Church doth erre, (and ſuch only, we ſay, are obliged to forſake your communion,) is, <hi>as Schoolmen ſpeak,</hi> Implicatio in terminis, <hi>a contradiction ſo plain, that one word deſtroyeth another; as if one ſhould ſay, a living dead man.</hi> For it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that they which believe ſome part of your Doctrin falſe, ſhould with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all believe it all true. Seeing therefore, for any man to believe your Church in error, and profeſs the contrary, is damnable Hypocriſie; to believe it and not believe it, a manifeſt repugnancy; and thirdly, to profeſs it and to continue in your Communion (as matters now ſtand) a plain impoſſibility; what remians, but that whoſoever is ſuppoſed to have juſt reaſon to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any doctrin of your Church, muſt of neceſsity forſake her Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Unleſs you would remit ſo far from your preſent rigour, as to allow them your Churches communion, who publikely profeſs that they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every article of her eſtabliſhed doctrin. Indeed, if you would do ſo, you might with ſome coherence ſuppoſe your Church in error, and yet find fault with men for abandoning her communion, becauſe they might continue in it, and ſuppoſe her in error. But to ſuppoſe your Church in error, and to excommunicate all thoſe that believe your own ſuppoſition, and then to complain that they continue not in your communion, is the moſt ridiculous incongruity that can be imagined. And therefore though your corruptions in doctrin, in themſelves (which yet is falſe) did not, yet your obliging us to profeſs your doctrin uncorrupted againſt knowledge and conſcience, may induce an obligation to depart from your communion. As, if there were any ſociety of Chriſtians, that held there were no Antipodes; notwithſtanding this error, I might communicate with them. But if I could not do ſo, without profeſsing my ſelf of their belief in this matter, then I ſuppoſe I ſhould be excus'd from Schiſm, if I ſhould forſake their communion, rather than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs my ſelf to believe that which I do not believe. Neither is there any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction or ſhadow of contradiction, that it may be neceſſary for my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to depart from this Churches communion: And that this Church (though erring in this matter) wants nothing neceſſary to Salvation. And yet this is that manifeſt contradiction, which D. <hi>Potter</hi> (you ſay) will never be able to ſalve; <hi>viz. That there might be neceſſary cauſe to depart from the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in ſome Doctrins and Practiſes, though ſhe wanted nothing neceſſary to Salvation.</hi>

Me thinks if you would convince D. <hi>Potters</hi> words of manifeſt contradiction, you ſhould ſhew, that he affirms and denies the ſame of the ſame. From which fault me thinks he ſhould be very innocent, who ſaies only, that that may be damnable to one, which is not ſo to another; and that may be neceſſary for one, which is not neceſſary for another. And this is all that D. <hi>Potter</hi> ſaies here: <hi>viz.</hi> That the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a falſehood to him that believes it, may be not damnable: and yet damnable to him that believes the contrary. Or that, not to profeſs a falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in him that knows it to be ſo, is neceſſary to ſalvation: and yet not ſo, in him that by error conceives it to be a truth. The words by you cited, and charged with unſalvable contradiction are in the 75. pag. But in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the ſame particular diſcourſe, in the next page but one he gives ſuch evident reaſon of them, (which can hardly be done to prove implicancy true) that whereas you ſay, <hi>he will never be able to ſalve them from contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> I believe any indifferent reader, having conſidered the place, will be very apt to think, that you (whatſoever you pretend) were very able to have done this curteſie for him, if your will had been anſwerable to your ability. I will ſet down the words, and leave the Reader to condemn or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve them. <hi>To forſake the errors of that Church, and not to joyn with her in thoſe practiſes which we account erroneous, we are inforced by neceſsity. For though in the iſſue they are not damnable to them which believe as they profeſs, yet for us to profeſs a vow by oath</hi> (<hi>as the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>enjoyns</hi>) <hi>what we believe not, were without queſtion damnable. And they with their errors, by the grace of God might go to Heaven, when we for our hypocriſie and diſsimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> (he might have added, <hi>and perjury</hi>) <hi>ſhould certainly be condemned to Hell.</hi>

                        <p n="61">61. <hi>Ad</hi> § 20. <hi>But a Church not erring in Fundamentals, though erring in other matters, doth what our Saviour exacts at her hands, doth as much as lies in her power to do: Therefore the communion of ſuch a Church is not upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Error to be forſaken.</hi> The conſequence is manifeſt. The antecedent is proved, becauſe <hi>God, by D.</hi> Potters <hi>confeſsion, hath promiſed his aſsiſtance no further, nor is it in her power to do more than God doth aſsiſt her to do.</hi> Anſ. The promiſe of Divine Aſſiſtance is two-fold: Abſolute, or Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional. That there ſhall be by Divine providence preſerv'd in the world to the worlds end, ſuch a Company of Chriſtians, who hold all things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely and indiſpenſably neceſſary to ſalvation, and nothing inevitably deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of it: This and no more the Doctor affirms that God hath promiſed abſolutely. Yet he neither doubts nor denies, but that a farther aſſiſtance is conditionally promiſed us, even ſuch an aſſiſtance as ſhall lead us, if we be not wanting to it and our ſelves, into all not only neceſſary, but very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table truth, and guard us from all not only deſtructive, but alſo hurtful Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. This, I ſay, he neither denies nor queſtions. And ſhould he have done ſo, he might have been confuted by evident and expreſs Text of Scripture. When therefore you ſay, That <hi>a Church not erring in Fundamentals, doth as much as by God's aſsiſtance lies in her power to do,</hi> This is manifeſtly untrue.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:64345:141"/>For God's aſſiſtance is alwaies ready to promote her farther. It is ready, I ſay, but on condition the Church does implore it: on condition, that when it is offered in the divine directions of Scripture and Reaſon, the Church be not negligent to follow it. If therefore there be any Church, which, retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Foundation, builds <hi>hay and ſtubble</hi> upon it; which believing what is ſo preciſely neceſſary, errs ſhamefully and dangerouſly in other things very profitable: This by no means argues defect of divine aſſiſtance in God, but neglect of this aſſiſtance in the Church. Neither is there any reaſon, why ſuch a Church ſhould pleaſe her ſelf too much for retaining fundamental truths, while ſhe remains ſo regardleſs of others. For though the ſimple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſome truths profitable only and not ſimply neceſſary, may conſiſt with ſalvation; yet, Who is there that can give her ſufficient aſſurance, that the neglect of ſuch truths is not damnable? Beſides, Who is there that can put her in ſufficient caution, that theſe Errors about profitable matters may not, according to the uſual fecundity of error, bring forth others of a higher quality, ſuch as are pernicious and peſtilent, and undermine by ſecret conſequences the very foundations of Religion and Piety? Laſtly, Who can ſay that ſhe hath ſufficiently diſcharged her duty to God &amp; man by avoiding only Fundamental Hereſies, if in the mean time ſhe be negligent of others, which though they do not plainly deſtroy Salvation, yet obſcure and hinder, and only not block up the way to it? Which though of themſelves and immediatly they damn no man, yet are cauſes and occaſions that many men run the race of Chriſtian piety more remiſly than they ſhould, many deferr their repentance, many go on ſecurely in their ſins, and ſo at length are damn'd by means and occaſion of theſe Errors, though not for them. Such Errors as theſe, (though thoſe of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be much worſe, even <hi>in themſelves damnable, and by accident only pardonable</hi>) yet, I ſay, ſuch Errors as theſe, if any Church ſhould tolerate, diſſemble, and ſuffer them to reign, and neglect to reform them, and not permit them to be freely, yet peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, oppoſed and impugned; Will any wiſe man ſay, that ſhe hath ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcharged her duty to God and man? that ſhe hath with due fidelity diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed the Goſpel of Chriſt? that ſhe hath done what ſhe could, and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What if ſhe thunder out her curſes againſt thoſe that will not believe them? What if ſhe rave and rage againſt them, and perſecute them with fire &amp; ſword, &amp; all kinds of moſt exquiſite torments? Truly I do much fear, that from ſuch a Church (though it hold no error abſolutely unconſiſtent with ſalvation,) the Candleſtick of God, either is already removed, or will be very ſhortly; and becauſe ſhe is negligent of profitable truths, that ſhe will loſe thoſe that are Neceſſary; and becauſe ſhe will not be led into all truths, that in ſhort time ſhe ſhall be led into none. And although this ſhould not happen, yet what mortal man can ſecure us, that not only a probable unaffected ignorance, not only a meer neglect of profitable truths, but alſo a retchleſs ſupine negligence, manifeſt contempt, Diſſimulation, Oppoſition, Oppreſſion of them may conſiſt with ſalvation? I truly for my part, though I hope very well of all ſuch, as, ſeeking all truth, find that which is neceſſary; who endeavouring to free themſelves from all Errors, any way contrary to the purity of Chriſtianity, yet fail of perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance and remain in ſome: yet if I did not find in my ſelf a love and deſire of all profitable truth; If I did not put away idleneſs, and prejudice, and
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:64345:141"/>worldly affections, and ſo examin to the bottom all my opinions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine matters, being prepar'd in mind to follow God, and God only, which way ſoever He ſhall lead me; If I did not hope, that I either do, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to do theſe things, certainly I ſhould have little hope of obtaining ſalvation.</p>
                        <p n="62">62. <hi>But to oblige any man under pain of damnation to forſake a Church by reaſon of ſuch errours, againſt which Chriſt thought it ſuperfluous to promiſe his aſsiſtance, and for which he neither denies his grace here, nor his glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, what is it but to make the narrow way to heaven, narrower than Chriſt left it? Anſw.</hi> It is not: for Chriſt himſelf hath obliged us hereunto. He hath forbad us under pain of damnation to profeſs what we believe not, and conſequently under the ſame penalty, to leave that Communion, in which we cannot remain without this hypocritical profeſſion of thoſe things, which we are convinc'd to be erroneous. But then beſides, it is here falſely ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, (as hath been ſhewed already) that Chriſt hath not promiſed aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to thoſe that ſeek it, but only in matters ſimply neceſſary. Neither is there any reaſon, why any Church, even in this world, ſhould deſpair of victory over all errours pernitious or noxious; provided ſhe humbly and earneſtly implore divine aſſiſtance, depend wholly upon it, and be not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it. Though a <hi>Triumph over all ſin and errour,</hi> that is, ſecurity that ſhe neither doth nor can err, be rather to be deſired than hoped for on earth, being a felicity reſerved for heaven.</p>
                        <p n="63">63. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 21. <hi>But at leaſt the Roman Church is as infallible as Proteſtants, and Proteſtants as fallible as the Roman Church: therefore to forſake the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church for errours, what is it but to flit from one erring Society to another? Anſ.</hi> The inconſequence of this Argument is too apparent: Proteſtants may err as well as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> therefore they did ſo! Boys in the Schools know, that <hi>à Poſſe ad Eſſe,</hi> the Argument follows not. He is equally falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble who believes twice two to be four, as he that believes them to be twenty: yet in this, he is not equally deceived, and he may be certain that he is not ſo. One Architect is no more infallible than another, and yet he is more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that his work is right and ſtreight who hath made it by the level, than he which hath made it by gueſs and by chance. So he that forſakes the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore renounceth her communion, that he may renounce the profeſsion of her errours, though he knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf fallible, as well as thoſe whom he hath forſaken, yet he may be certain (as certain as the nature of the thing will bear) that he is not herein decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: becauſe he may ſee the doctrin forſaken by him repugnant to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and the doctrin embraced by him conſonant to it. At leaſt, this he may know, that the doctrin which he hath choſen, to him ſeems true, and the contrary which he hath forſaken, ſeems falſe: And therefore without remorſe of conſcience, he may profeſs that, but this he cannot.</p>
                        <p n="64">64. But <hi>we are to remember, that, according to D.</hi> Potter, <hi>the viſible Church hath a bleſsing not to err in Fundamentals, in which any private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former may fail, therefore there was no neceſſity of forſaking the Church, out of whoſe communion they were expoſed to danger of falling into many more, and even into damnable errours. Anſw.</hi> The viſible Church is free indeed from all errours abſolutely deſtructive and unpardonable, but not from all errour which in it is ſelf damnable: not from all which will actually bring damnation upon them, that keep themſelves in them, by their own
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:64345:142"/>voluntary and avoidable fault. From ſuch errours which are thus damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, D. <hi>Potter</hi> doth no where ſay, that the viſible Church hath any privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or exemption. Nay, you your ſelf teach, that he plainly teacheth the contrary, and thereupon will allow him to be no more charitable to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, than Papiſts are to Proteſtants: and yet upon this affected miſtake your Diſcourſe is founded in almoſt forty places of your Book. Beſides, any private man who truly believes the Scripture, and ſeriouſly endeavours to know the will of God, and to do it, is as ſecure as the viſible Church, more ſecure than your Church, from the danger of erring in fundamentals: for it is impoſſible, that any man ſo qualified ſhould fall into any errour which to him will prove damnable. For God requires no more of any man to his Salvation, but his true endeavour to be ſaved. Laſtly, abiding in your Churches Communion is ſo farr from ſecuring me or any man from damnable errour, that if I ſhould abide in it, I am certain I could not be ſaved. For abide in it I cannot, without profeſſing to believe your entire doctrin true: profeſs this I cannot, but I muſt lie perpetually, and exulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate my conſcience. And though your errours were not in themſelves dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, yet to reſiſt the known Truth, and to continue in the profeſſion of known errours and falſehood, is certainly a capital ſin, and of great affinity with the ſin which ſhall never be forgiven.</p>
                        <p n="65">65. But <hi>neither is the Church of Proteſtants perfectly free from errours and corruptions: ſo the Doctor confeſſes p.</hi> 69. <hi>which he can only excuſe, by ſaying, they are not fundamental, as likewiſe thoſe in the Roman Church, are confeſſed not to be fundamental. And what man of judgment will be a Proteſtant, ſince that Church is confeſſedly a corrupted one? Anſ.</hi> And yet you your ſelf make large Diſcourſes in this very Chapter, to perſwade Proteſtants to continue in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> though ſuppoſed to have ſome corruptions. And why, I pray, may not a man of judgment continue in this Communion of a Church confeſſedly corrupted, as well as a Church ſuppoſed to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, requires the belief and profeſſion of her ſuppoſed corruptions, as the condition of her Communion: which this Church, confeſſedly corrupted, doth not? What man of judgment will think it any diſparagement to his judgment, to preferr the better, though not ſimply the beſt, before that which is ſtark naught? To preferr indifferent good health, before a diſeaſed and corrupted ſtate of Body? To preferr a field not perfectly weeded, before a field that is quite over-run with weeds and thorns? And therefore though Proteſtants have ſome Errours, yet ſeeing they are neither ſo great as yours, nor impos'd with ſuch tyranny, nor maintained with ſuch obſtinacy; he that conceives it any diſparagement to his judgment, to change your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion for theirs, though confeſſed to have ſome corruptions, it may well be preſum'd that he hath but little judgment. For as for your pretence that yours are confeſſed not to be Fundamental, it is an affected miſtake as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready I have often told you.</p>
                        <p n="66">66. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 22. <hi>But D.</hi> Potter <hi>ſayes, It is comfort enough for the Church, that the Lord in mercy will ſecure her from all her capital dangers: but ſhe may not hope to triumph over all ſin and errour, till ſhe be in heaven. Now if it be comfort enough, to be ſecur'd from all capital dangers, which can ariſe only from errour in fundamental points, Why were not our firſt Reformers content with enough, but would needs diſmember the Church, out of a pernitious gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of more than enough? Anſw.</hi> I have already ſhewed ſufficiently,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:64345:142"/>how capital danger may ariſe from errours, though not fundamental. I add now, that what may be enough for men in ignorance, may be to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men not enough: according to that of the Goſpel, <hi>to whom much is given, of him much ſhall be required:</hi> That the ſame errour may be not capital to thoſe who want means of finding the truth, and capital to others who have means, and neglect to uſe them: That to continue in the profeſſion of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour diſcovered to be ſo, may be damnable, though the errour be not ſo. Theſe I preſume are reaſons enough, and enough why the firſt Reformers might think, and juſtly, that not enough for themſelves, which yet to ſome of their Predeceſſors they hope might be enough.

Anſw.</hi> The Doctor does not ſay, that no Church may hope to be free from all errour, either perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, or any way noxious: But that <hi>no Church may hope to be ſecure from all errour ſimply,</hi> for this were indeed truly to triumph over all. But then we ſay not, that the Communion of any Church is to be forſaken for errors unfundamental, unleſs it exact withall either a diſſimulation of them being noxious; or a Profeſſion of them againſt the dictate of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, if they be meer errours. This, if the Church does (as certainly yours doth,) then her Communion is to be forſaken, rather than the ſin of Hypocriſie to be committed. Whereas to forſake the Churches of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants for ſuch errours, there is no neceſſity, becauſe they err to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and do not under pain of Excommunication exact the profeſsion of their errours.</p>

Not the quality, becauſe we ſuppoſe them not fundamental. Not the number, becauſe the foundation is ſtrong enough to ſupport them. Anſw.</hi> Here again you vainly ſuppoſe, that we conceive your errours in themſelves not damnable: Though, we hope, they are not abſolutely unpardonable: but to ſay they are pardonable, is indeed to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them damnable. Secondly, though the errours of your Church did not warrant our departure, yet your Tyrannous Impoſition of them, would be our ſufficient juſtification.

                        <p n="70">70. Our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour hath declared his will, that we forgive a private offender ſeventy ſeven times, that is, without limitation of quantity of time, or quality of treſpaſſes; and then, how dare we alledge his command, that we muſt not pardon his Church for errours acknowledged to be not fundamental? Anſ.</hi> He that commands us to pardon our brother ſinning againſt us ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, will not allow us for his ſake to ſin with him, ſo much as once. He will have us do any thing but ſin, rather than offend any man. But his will is alſo, that we offend all the World, rather than ſin in the leaſt matter. And therefore though his will were, and it were in our power (which yet is falſe) to pardon the errours of an erring Church; yet certainly it is not his will, that we ſhould err with the Church, or if we do not, that we ſhould againſt conſcience profeſs the errours of it.</p>

But <hi>Schiſmatiques from the Church of</hi> England, <hi>or any other Church, with this very Anſwer, that they forſake not the Church, but the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of it, may caſt off from themſelves the imputation of Schiſm. Anſ.</hi> True, they may make the ſame Anſwer, and the ſame defence as we do, as a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer can cry Not guilty, as well as an innocent perſon, but not ſo truly, nor ſo juſtly. The queſtion is, not what may be pretended, but what can be proved by Schiſmatiques. They may object errours to other Churches, as well as we do to yours; but that they prove their accuſation ſo ſtrongly as we can, that appears not. To the Prieſts and Elders of the Jews, impoſing that ſacred ſilence mentioned in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> anſwered, <hi>They muſt obey God rather than men.</hi> The three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> gave in effect the ſame anſwer. Give me now any factious Hypocrite, who makes Religion the pretence and cloak of his Rebellion, and, Who ſees not that ſuch a one may anſwer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in thoſe very formal words, which the holy Apoſtles and Martyrs made uſe of? And yet, I preſume, no Chriſtian will deny, but this Anſwer was good, in the mouth of the Apoſtles and Martyrs, though it were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to be abuſed, by Traytors, and Rebels. Certainly therefore it is no good conſequence to ſay, Schiſmatiques may make uſe of this Anſwer, therefore all that do make uſe of it are Schiſmatiques. But moreover, it is to be obſerved, that the chief part of our defence, that you deny your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to all that deny or doubt of any part of your doctrin, cannot with any colour be imployed againſt Proteſtants: who grant their Communion to all who hold with them, not all things, but things neceſſary, that is, ſuch as are in Scripture plainly delivered.</p>

If all men would ſubmit themſelves to the chief Mufty of the Turks, it is apparent there-would be no diviſions; yet unity is not to be purchaſed at ſo dear a rate. It were a thing much to be deſired, that there were no diviſions: yet difference of opinions touching points controverted, is rather to be choſen, than unanimous concord in damned errours: As it is better for men to go to heaven by divers ways, or rather by divers paths of the ſame way, than in the ſame path to go on peaceably to hell. <hi>Amica Pax, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis amica Veritas!</hi>

But who, I pray, are they that teach them? Where does D. <hi>Potter</hi> accuſe thoſe Proteſtants of <hi>damnable Schiſm,</hi> who left your Church becauſe they hold it erroneous in neceſſary points? What Proteſtant is there that holds not that you taught things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the plain precepts of Chriſt; both Ceremonial, in mutilating the Communion; and Moral, in points of Superſtition and Idolatry, and moſt bloody tyranny? which is without queſtion to err in neceſſary matters. Neither does D. <hi>Potter</hi> accuſe any man of Schiſm for holding ſo: if he ſhould, he ſhould call himſelf a Schiſmatique. Only he ſays, ſuch (if there be any ſuch) as affirm, that ignorant ſouls among you, who had no means to know the truth, cannot poſſibly be ſaved, that their wiſdom and charity cannot be juſtified.

Again, where doth D. <hi>Potter</hi> ſuppoſe (as you make him) that there were other Proteſtants, who believed that your Church had no errours? Or, where does he ſay, they did well to forſake her, upon this ridiculous reaſon, becauſe they judged that ſhe retained all means neceſſary to ſalvation? Do you think us ſo ſtupid, as that we cannot diſtinguiſh between that which D. <hi>Potter</hi> ſays, and that which you make him ſay? He vindicates Proteſtants from Schiſm two ways: The one is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had juſt and great and neceſſary cauſe to ſeparate, which Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques never have; becauſe they that have it, are no Schiſmatiques: For ſchiſm is always a cauſeleſs ſeparation. The other is, becauſe they did not joyn with their ſeparation, an uncharitable damning of all thoſe from whom they did divide themſelves, as the manner of Schiſmatiques is. Now that
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:64345:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>which he intends for a circumſtance of our ſeparation, you make him, make the cauſe of it, and the motive to it. And whereas he ſays, <hi>Though we ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from you in ſome things, yet we acknowledge your Church a member of the body of Chriſt, and therefore are not Schiſmatiques:</hi> You make him ſay moſt abſurdly, <hi>We did well to forſake you, becauſe we judged you a member of the body of Chriſt.</hi> Juſt as if a brother ſhould leave his brothers company in ſome ill courſes, and ſhould ſay to him, Herein I forſake you, yet I leave you not abſolutely, for I acknowledge you ſtill to be my brother, and ſhall uſe you as a brother: And you perverting his ſpeech ſhould pretend that he had ſaid, I leave your company in theſe il courſes, and I do well to do ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are my brother: ſo making that the cauſe of leaving him, which indeed is the cauſe that he left him no farther.</p>
                        <p n="75">75. But you ſay, <hi>The very reaſon for which he acquitteth himſelf from Schiſm, is, becauſe he holds that the Church which they forſook, is not cut off from the Body of Chriſt. Anſ.</hi> This is true: But can you not perceive a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between juſtifying his ſeparation from Schiſm by this reaſon, and making this the reaſon of his ſeparation? If a man denying obedience in ſome unlawful matter to his lawful Soveraign, ſhould ſay to him, Herein I diſobey you, but yet I am no Rebel, becauſe I acknowledg you my Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord, and am ready to obey you in all things lawful; ſhould not he be an egregious Sycophant, that ſhould accuſe him, as if he had ſaid, I do well to diſobey you, becauſe I acknowledge you my lawful Soveraign? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he that joyns this acknowledgment with his neceſſitated obedience, does well; but he that makes this conſideration the reaſon of diſobedience doth ill. Urge therefore this (as you call it) moſt ſolemn foppery as far as you pleaſe: For every underſtanding Reader will eaſily perceive that this is no foppery of D. <hi>Potters,</hi> but a calumny of yours; from which he is as far, as he is from holding yours to be the true Church: whereas it is a ſign of a great deal of Charity in him, that he allows you to be a Part of it.</p>
                        <p n="76">76. And <hi>whereas you pretend to find ſuch unſpeakable comfort herein, that we cannot clear our ſelves from Schiſm, otherwiſe than by acknowledging that they do not, nor cannot, cut off your Church from the hope of ſalvation:</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to take care that this falſe comfort coſt you not too dear. For why this good opinion of God Almighty, that he will not damn men for errour, who were without their own fault ignorant of the truth, ſhould be any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to them, who, having the key of knowledge, will neither uſe it themſelves, nor permit others to uſe it; who have eyes to ſee and will not ſee, who have ears to hear and will not hear! this, I aſſure you, paſſeth my capacity to apprehend. Neither <hi>is this to make our ſalvation depend on yours,</hi> but only ours and yours not deſperately inconſiſtent, nor to ſay, we <hi>muſt be damn'd, unleſs you may be ſaved;</hi> but that we aſſure our ſelves, if our lives be anſwerable, we ſhall be ſaved by our knowledge. And that we hope, (and I tell you again, <hi>Spes eſt rei incertae nomen</hi>) that ſome of you may poſſibly be ſaved by occaſion of their unaffected Ignorance.</p>
                        <p n="77">77. For our brethren, whom you ſay, <hi>we condemn of hereſie for denying the Churches perpetuity,</hi> we know none that do ſo: unleſs you conceive a corrupted Church to be none at all; and, if you do, then for ought I know, in your account we muſt be all Heretiques; for all of us acknowledge that the Church might be corrupted even with errours in themſelves damnable, and not only might, but hath been.</p>

78. <hi>But Schiſm conſiſts in being divided from that true Church, with which a man agreeth in all points of faith: Now we muſt profeſs, you ſay, that we agree with the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in all Fundamental Articles; Therefore we are Schiſmatiques. Anſ.</hi> Either in your Major, <hi>by all points of faith,</hi> you mean <hi>all fundamental points only,</hi> or <hi>all ſimply and abſolutely.</hi> If the former, I deny your Major: for I may without all ſchiſm divide from that Church which errs in any point of faith Fundamental, or otherwiſe, if ſhe require the profeſſion of this Error among the conditions of her Communion. Now this is our caſe. If the later, I deny the ſyllogiſm, as having manifeſtly four tearms, and being coſen-german to this,</p>

                        <p n="79">79. <hi>But they who judge a reconciliation with the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>to be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, they that ſay, there might be juſt and neceſsary cauſe to depart from it, and that they of that Church which have underſtanding and means to diſcover their Errour, and neglect to uſe them, are not to be ſlattered with hope of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; they do cut off that Church from the body of Chriſt, and the hope of ſalvation, and ſo are Schiſmatiques: but D.</hi> Potter <hi>doth the former; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is a ſchiſmatique. Anſ.</hi> No, he doth not: not cut off that whole Church from the hope of ſalvation, not thoſe members of it who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincibly, or excuſably ignorant of the truth; but thoſe only who having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and means to diſcover their errour, neglect to uſe them. Now theſe are not the whole Church; and therefore he that, ſuppoſing their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence, cuts theſe off from hope of ſalvation, cannot be juſtly ſaid to cut off that whole Church from the Body of Chriſt, and the hope of ſalvation.</p>
                        <p n="80">80. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 28, 29. Whereas D. <hi>Potter ſays, There is a great difference between a Schiſm from them, and a Reformation of our ſelves: this,</hi> you ſay, <hi>is a quaint ſubtilty, by which all Schiſm and Sin may be as well excuſed.</hi> It ſeems then in your judgment, that theeves and adulterers, and murtherers, and traytors may ſay with as much probability as Proteſtants, that they did no hurt to others, but only reform themſelves. But then methinks it is very ſtrange, that all Proteſtants ſhould agree with one conſent in this defence of themſelves from the imputation of Schiſm: &amp; that to this day, never any Theef or Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer ſhould have been heard of, to make uſe of this Apologie! And then for Schiſmatiques I would know, Whether <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated the Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> for not conſorming to his Church in keeping <hi>Eaſter;</hi> whether <hi>Novatian</hi> that divided from <hi>Cornelius,</hi> upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that himſelf was elected Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> when indeed he was not; whether <hi>Feliciſſimus</hi> and his Crew, that went out of the Church of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> and ſet up Altar againſt Altar, becauſe having fallen in perſecution, they might not be reſtored to the peace of the Church preſently, upon the interceſsion of the Confeſſours; whether the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who divided from, and damned all the World, becauſe all the World would not excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate them who were accuſed only, and not convicted, to have been Traditors of the ſacred Books; whether they which for the ſlips and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of others, which they might and ought to tolerate, or upon ſome difference in matters of Order and Ceremony, or for ſome Errour in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, neither pernitious nor hurtful to Faith or Piety, ſepatate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from others, or others from themſelves; or laſtly, whether they
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:64345:145"/>that put themſelves out of the Churches unity and obedience, becauſe their opinions are not approved there, but reprehended and confuted, or becauſe being of impious converſation, they are impatient of their Churches cenſure: I would know, I ſay, whether all, or any of theſe, may with any face, or without extream impudency, put in this plea of Proteſtants, and pretend with as much likelyhood as they, that they did not ſeparate from others, but only reform themſelves? But ſuppoſe they were ſo impudent as to ſay ſo in their own defence falſely, doth it follow by any good Logick, that therefore this Apology is not to be imployed by Proteſtants, who may ſay ſo truly? <hi>We make</hi> ſay they) <hi>no Schiſm from you, but only a reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our ſelves: This,</hi> you reply, <hi>is no good juſtification, becauſe it may be pretended by any Schiſmatique.</hi> Very true, any Schiſmatique that can ſpeak may ſay the ſame words, (as any Rebel that makes Conſcience the cloak of his impious diſobedience, may ſay with Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and Saint <hi>John, We muſt obey God rather than men:</hi>) But then the queſtion is, whether any Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique may ſay ſo truly? And to this queſtion you ſay juſt nothing: but conclude, becauſe this defence may be abuſed by ſome, it muſt be uſed by none. As if you ſhould have ſaid, S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>John</hi> did ill to make ſuch an anſwer as they made, becauſe impious Hypocrites might make uſe of the ſame to palliate their Diſobedience and Rebellion againſt the lawful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of lawful Authority.</p>
                        <p n="81">81. <hi>But ſeeing their pretended Reformation conſiſted in forſaking the Churches corruptions, their Reformation of themſelves, and their diviſion from you, falls out to be one and the ſame thing.</hi> Juſt as if two men having been a long while companions in drunkenneſs, one of them ſhould turn ſober; this Reformation of himſelf, and deſertion of his companion, in this ill cuſtom, would be one and the ſame thing, and yet there is no neceſſity that he ſhould leave his love to him at all, or his ſociety in other things. So Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants forſaking their own former corruptions, which were common to them with you, could not chooſe but withal forſake you in the practice of theſe corruptions: yet this they might, and would have done without breach of Charity towards you; and without a renunciation of your company in any act of piety and devotion, confeſſedly lawful. And therefore though both theſe were by accident joyned together, yet this hinders not but that the end they aimed at, was not a ſeparation from you, but a reformation of themſelves.</p>
                        <p n="82">82. Neither <hi>doth their diſagreement in the particulars of the Reformation,</hi> (which yet when you meaſure it without partiality, you will find to be farr ſhort of infinite) nor <hi>their ſymbolizing in the general of forſaking your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,</hi> prove any thing to the contrary, or any way advantage your deſign or make for your purpoſe. For it is not any ſign at all, much leſs an evident ſign, that they had no ſetled deſign, but only to forſake the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> for nothing but malice can deny, that their intent at leaſt was, to reduce Religion to that original purity from which it was fallen. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination from which, ſome conceiving to have begun (though ſecretly) in the Apoſtles times, <hi>(the myſtery of iniquity being then in work;)</hi> and after their departure to have ſhewed it ſelf more openly: Others again believing, that the Church continued pure for ſome Ages after the Apoſtles, and then declined: And conſequently ſome aiming at an exact conformity with the Apoſtolique times: Others thinking they ſhould do
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:64345:145"/>God and Men good ſervice, could they reduce the Church to the condition of the fourth and fifth Ages: Some taking their direction in this work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, only from Scripture; others, from the writings of Fathers, and the Decrees of Councels of the firſt five Ages: certainly, it is no great marvail, that there was, as you ſay, diſagreement between them, in the particulars of their Reformation; nay morally ſpeaking, it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it ſhould be otherwiſe. Yet let me tell you, the difference between them (eſpecially in compariſon of your Church and Religion,) is not the difference between good and bad, but between good and better: And they did beſt that followed Scripture interpreted by Catholique written-Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which Rule the reformers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> propoſed to themſelves to follow.</p>
                        <p n="83">83. <hi>Ad</hi> § 30, 31, 32. To this effect D. <hi>Potter,</hi> p. 81, 82. of his Book, ſpeaks thus. <hi>If a Monaſtery ſhould reformat it ſelf, and ſhould reduce into pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice ancient good diſcipline, when others would not: In this caſe could it be charged with Schiſm from others, or with Apoſtacy from its rule and order? So in a Society of men univerſally infected with ſome diſeaſe, they that ſhould free themſelves from it, could they be therefore ſaid to ſeparate from the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi> He preſumes they could not, and from hence concludes, <hi>that neither can the Reformed Churches be truly accuſed for making a Schiſm, (that is, ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the Church, and making themſelves no members of it) if all they did was (as indeed it was) to reform themſelves.</hi> Which Caſes, I believe, any underſtanding man will plainly ſee to have in them an exact parity of Reaſon, and that therefore the Argument drawn from them is preſsing and unanſwerable. And it may well be ſuſpected, that you were partly of this mind, otherwiſe you would not have ſo preſum'd upon the ſimplicity of your Reader, as pretending to anſwer it, to put another of your own making in place of it, and then to anſwer that.</p>
                        <p n="84">84. This you do § 31, 32. of this Chapter, in theſe words, <hi>I was very glad to find you in a Monaſtery, &amp;c.</hi> Where I beſeech the Reader to obſerve theſe things to detect the cunning of your tergiverſation: Firſt, That you have no reaſon to ſay, <hi>That you found D.</hi> Potter <hi>in a Monaſtery:</hi> and as little, <hi>That you find him inventing wayes how to forſake his vocation, and to maintain the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Schiſm from the Church, and Apoſtacy from a Religious Order.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the innocent caſe put by the Doctor, of a Monaſtery reforming it ſelf, hath not deſerved ſuch grievous accuſations. Unleſs Reformation with you be all one with Apoſtacy: and to forſake ſin and diſorder, be to forſake ones Vocation. And ſurely, if it be ſo, your vocations are not very lawlful, &amp; your Religious Orders not very religious. Secondly, that you quite pervert and change D. <hi>Potters</hi> caſes, and inſtead of the caſe, of a <hi>whole Monaſtery reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf, when other Monaſteries of their Order would not;</hi> and of <hi>ſome men freeing themſelves from the common diſeaſe of their Society, when others would not:</hi> you ſubſtitute two others, which you think you can better deal with; of <hi>ſome particular Monks, upon pretence of the neglect of leſſer mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtical obſervances going out of their Monaſtery, which Monaſtery yet did confeſſedly obſerve their ſubſtantial Vows, and all Principal Statutes: And of a diſeaſed Reaſon, quitting the company of thoſe that were infected with the ſame diſeaſe: though in their company, there was no danger from his diſeaſe, it being impoſsible that ſhould be mortal: and out of it, no hope of eſcaping others like that for which he forſook the firſt infected Company.</hi> I appeal now to
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:64345:146"/>any indifferent judge, whether theſe caſes be the ſame or neer the ſame with D. <hi>Potters?</hi> Whether this be fair and ingenuous dealing, in ſtead of his two Inſtances, which plainly ſhewed it poſſible in other Societies, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in that of the Church, to leave the faults of a Society, and not leave being of it, to foiſt in two others clean croſs to the Doctors purpoſe, of men under colour of faults, abandoning the Society wherein they lived? I know not what others may think of this dealing, but, to me, this declining D. <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's</hi> caſes and conveying others into their place, is a great aſſurance, that as they were put by him, you could ſay nothing to them,</p>
                        <p n="85">85. But that no ſuſpicion of tergiverſation may be faſtened upon me, I am content to deal with you a little, at your own weapons. Put the caſe then, though not juſt as you would have it, yet with as much favour to you, as in reaſon you can expect, That a Monaſtery did obſerve her ſubſtantial vows, and all Principal Statutes; but yet did generally practiſe, and alſo enjoyn the violation of ſome leſſer, yet obliging obſervances, and had done ſo time out of mind: And that ſome inferiour Monks more conſcientious than the reſt, diſcovering this abuſe, ſhould firſt with all earneſtneſs ſollicite their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours for a general and orderly reformation of theſe, though ſmall and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial corruptions, yet corruptions: But finding they hop'd and labour'd in vain to effect this, ſhould reform theſe faults in themſelves, and refuſe to joyn in the practiſe of them, with the reſt of their Confraternity, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting reſolutely in ſuch a refuſal, ſhould by their Superiours be caſt out of their Monaſtery, and being not to be re-admitted without a promiſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting from their ſtiffeneſs in theſe things, and of condeſcending to others in the practiſe of theſe ſmall faults, ſhould chooſe rather to continue exiles, than to re-enter upon ſuch conditions: I would know whether you would condemn ſuch men of Apoſtacy from the Order? Without doubt, if you ſhould, you would find the ſtream of your Caſuiſts againſt you; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, involve S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſame condemnation, who plainly tells us, that <hi>we may not do the leaſt evil, that we may do the greateſt good.</hi> Put caſe again, you ſhould be part of a Society univerſally infected with ſome diſeaſe, and diſcovering a certain remedy for this diſeaſe, ſhould perſwade the whole company to make uſe of it, but find the greateſt part of them ſo farr in love with their diſeaſe, that they were reſolved to keep it; nay ſo fond of it, that they ſhould make a decree, that whoſoever would leave it, ſhould leave their company. Suppoſe now, that your ſelf and ſome few others, ſhould notwithſtanding their injunction to the contrary, free your ſelves from this diſeaſe, and thereupon they ſhould abſolutely forſake and reject you: I would know in this caſe who deſerves to be condemned, whether you of uncharitable deſertion of your company, or they of a tyrannical peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? And if in theſe caſes you will (as I verily believe you will,) acquit the inferiors and condemn the ſuperiors, abſolve the minor part and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the major, then can you with no reaſon condemn Proteſtants, for chooſing rather to be ejected from the communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, than with her to perſiſt (as of neceſſity they were to do, if they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in her communion) in the profeſsion of errors, though not deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of ſalvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet hindring edification; and in the Practiſe, or at leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of many (ſuppoſe not mortal but venial) corruptions.</p>
                        <p n="86">86. Thirdly, the Reader may be pleas'd to be advertis'd that you cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure too partially the corrupt eſtate of your <hi>Church in comparing it to a
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:64345:146"/>Monaſtery, which did confeſſedly obſerve their ſubſtantial vows, and all prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Statutes of their Order, and moreover was ſecured by an infallible aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, for the avoiding of all ſubſtantial corruptions:</hi> for of your Church we confeſs no ſuch matter, but ſay plainly, That ſhe not only might fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſubſtantial corruptions, but did ſo; that ſhe did not only generally vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, but of all the members of her communion, either in act or approbation, require and exact the violation of many ſubſtantial laws of Chriſt, both Ceremonial and Moral, which though we hope it was pardonable in them, who had not means to know their error, yet, of its own nature, and to them who did or might have known their error, was certainly damnable. And that it was not the <hi>tything of Mint, and Anniſe, and Cummin,</hi> the neglect whereof we impute unto you, but <hi>the neglect of judgment, juſtice, and the weightier matters of the Law.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="87">87. Fourthly, I am to repreſent unto you, that you uſe Proteſtants very ſtrangely, in comparing them to a company, who all were <hi>known to be led to their pretended Reformation, not with an intent of Reformation, but with ſome other ſiniſter Intention;</hi> which is impoſſible to be known of you, and therefore to judge ſo, is againſt Chriſtian charity, and common equity: and to ſuch a <hi>Company as acknowledge that themſelves, as ſoon as they were gone out from the Monaſtery that refuſed to reform, muſt not hope to be free from thoſe or the like Errors, and Corruptions, for which they left their Brethren:</hi> ſeeing this very hope and nothing elſe, moved them to leave your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: and this ſpeech of yours, ſo farr as it concerns the ſame errors, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyes it ſelf. For how can they poſſibly fall into the ſame errors by forſaking your Communion, which that they may forſake they do forſake your Communion? And then for other errors of the like nature and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or more enormious than yours, though they deny it not poſsible, but by their negligence and wickedneſs they may fall into them, yet they are ſo far from acknowledging that they have no hope to avoid this miſchief, that they proclaim to all the world, that it is moſt prone and eaſie to do ſo, to all thoſe that fear God and love the Truth; and hardly poſsible for them to do otherwiſe, without ſupine negligence and extream impiety.</p>
                        <p n="88">88. To fit the Reddition of your perverted Simile, to the Propoſition of it, you tell <hi>us that we teach, that for all fundamental points, the Church is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from error.</hi> I anſwer, Fundamental errors may ſignifie, either ſuch as are repugnant to Gods command, and ſo in their own nature damnable, though to thoſe which out of invincible ignorance practiſe them, not unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable: or ſuch as are not only meritoriouſly, but remedileſsly pernitious and deſtructive of Salvation. We hope that yours, and the <hi>Greek,</hi> and other Churches before the Reformation, had not ſo far apoſtated from Chriſt, as to be guilty of errors of the later ſort. We ſay, that not only the Catholique Church, but every particular true Church, ſo long as it continues a Church, is ſecur'd from Fundamental errors of this kind, but ſecur'd not abſolutely by any promiſe of divine aſſiſtance, which being not ordinarily irreſiſtible, but temper'd to the nature of the Receivers, may be neglected, and therefore withdrawn; but by the Repugnance of any error in this ſenſe fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental to the eſſence and nature of a Church. So that, to ſpeak proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not any ſet known company of men is ſecur'd, that, though they neglect the means of avoiding error, yet certainly, they ſhall not err in fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, which were neceſſary for the conſtitution of an infallible guide of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64345:147"/>faith: But rather they which know what is meant by a Church, are ſecur'd or rather certain that a Church remaining a Church cannot fall into funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental errors; becauſe, when it does ſo, it is no longer a Church. As they are certain, that men cannot become unreaſonable creatures, becauſe when they do ſo, they are no longer men. But for fundamental errors of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſort, which yet, I hope, will warrant our departure from any Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion infected with them and requiring the profeſſion of them; from ſuch fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental errors, we do not teach ſo much as that the Church Catholique, much leſs, (which only were for your purpoſe,) that your Church hath any protection or ſecurity, but know for a certain, that many errors of this nature, had prevailed againſt you; and that a vain preſumption of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute divine aſſiſtance (which yet is promiſed but upon conditions,) made both your preſent errors incurable and expoſed you to the imminent danger of more and greater. This therefore is either to abuſe what we ſay, or to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe falſely upon us what we ſay not. And to this you preſently add ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manifeſt falſehood, <hi>viz.</hi> that we ſay, <hi>That no particular perſon, or Church, hath any promiſe of aſsiſtance in points fundamental.</hi> Whereas, croſs to this in diameter, there is no Proteſtant but holds, and muſt hold, that there is no particular Church; no, nor perſon; but hath promiſe of divine aſſiſtance to lead them into all neceſſary truth, if they ſeek it as they ſhould, by the means which God hath appointed. And ſhould we ſay otherwiſe, we ſhould contrary plain Scripture, which aſſures us plainly, That <hi>every one that ſeeketh findeth, and every one that as keth receiveth:</hi> and that <hi>if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil, can give good gifts to our children, much more ſhall our heavenly Father, give his Spirit to them that ask it:</hi> and that, <hi>if any man want wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> (eſpecially ſpiritual wiſdom) <hi>he is to ask of God, who giveth to all men, and upbraideth not.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="89">89. You obtrude upon us thirdly, <hi>That when</hi> Luther <hi>began, he being but one, oppoſed himſelf to all, as well Subjects as Superiors. Anſ.</hi> If he did ſo in the cauſe of God, it was heroically done of him.

Secondly, it is more than you can juſtifie. For though no man before him lifted up his voyce like a trumpet, as <hi>Luther</hi> did; yet who can aſſure us, but that many before him, both thought, and ſpake in the lower voyce of petitions and remonſtrances, in many points, as he did.</p>

Fourthly and laſtly, whereas you ſay, that <hi>many chief learned Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, are forced to confeſs the Antiquity of your Doctrin and Practiſe:</hi> I anſwer: Of many Doctrins and Practiſes of yours, this is not true, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be true by thoſe that have dealt in this Argument. Search your
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:64345:147"/>Store-houſe, M. <hi>Brerely,</hi> who hath travailed as far in this Northweſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, as it was poſſible for humane induſtry, and when you have done ſo, I pray inform me, what confeſſions of Proteſtants have you, for the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the Doctrin of the Communion in one kind: the lawfulneſs and expedience of the <hi>Latin</hi>-Service: For the preſent uſe of Indulgences: For the Popes power in Temporalities over Princes: For the picturing of the Trinity: For the lawfulneſs of the worſhip of Pictures: For your Beads and Roſary, and Ladies Pſalter; and in a word, for your whole worſhip of the Bleſſed Virgin: For your Oblations by way of Conſumption, and therefore in the quality of Sacrifices to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and other Saints: For your ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Pater-noſters,</hi> and Creeds to the honour of Saints, and of <hi>Ave-Maries</hi> to the honor of other Saints beſides the Bleſſed Virgin: For the infallibility of the Biſhop or Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> For your prohibiting the Scripture to be read publikely in the Church, in ſuch languages as all may underſtand: For your Doctrin of the bleſſed Virgin's immunity from actual ſin; and for your doctrin and worſhip of her immaculate Conception: For the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Auricular Confeſſion: For the neceſſity of the Prieſts Intention to obtain benefit by any of your Sacraments: And laſtly, (not to trouble my ſelf with finding out more) for this very Doctrin of Licentiouſneſs, That though a man live and die without the Practiſe of Chriſtian vertues, and with the habits of many damnable ſins unmortified; yet if in the laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life, he have any ſorrow for his ſins, and joyn confeſſion with it, certainly he ſhall be ſaved? Secondly, they that confeſs ſome of your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins to have been the Doctrin of the Fathers, may be miſtaken, being abuſed by many words and phraſes of the Fathers, which have the <hi>Roman</hi> ſound, when they are farr from the ſenſe. Some of them I am ſure are ſo, I will name <hi>Goulartius,</hi> who in his Commentaries on S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s 35. <hi>Ep.</hi> grants that the ſentence [<hi>Hereſies have ſprung,</hi> &amp;c.] quoted by you §. 36. of this Chapter, was meant of <hi>Cornelius:</hi> whereas it will be very plain to any attentive Reader, that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks there of himſelf. Thirdly, though ſome Proteſtants confeſs ſome of your Doctrin to be Ancient, yet this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo long as it is evident, even by the confeſſion of all ſides, that many errors, I inſtance in that of the <hi>Millenaries,</hi> and the communicating of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, were more ancient. Not any Antiquity therefore, unleſs it be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and primitive, is a certain ſign of true Doctrin. For if the Church were obnoxious to corruption (as we pretend it was), who can poſſibly war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant us, that, part of this corruption might not get in and prevail in the 5. or 4. or 3. or 2. age? Eſpecially ſeeing the Apoſtles aſſure us, that the <hi>myſtery of iniquity was working,</hi> though more ſecretly even in their times. If any man ask, How could it become univerſal in ſo ſhort a time? Let him tell me how the Errour of the Millenaries, and the communicating of Infants, became ſo ſoon univerſal; and then he ſhall acknowledge, what was done in ſome, was poſſible in others. Laſtly, to cry quittance with you: as there are Proteſtants who confeſs the antiquity, but always poſt-nate to Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, of ſome poynts of your Doctrin: ſo there want not Papiſts who acknowledge as freely, the Novelty of many of them, and the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of ours.

Whereas therefore you cloſe up this Simile with <hi>conſider theſe points, and ſee whether your Similitude do not condemn your Progenitors of Schiſm from God's viſible Church:</hi> I aſſure you, I have well conſidered them, and do plainly ſee that this is not D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s ſimilitude, but your own; and beſides, that it is wholly made up of miſtakes and falſhoods, and is at no hand, a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient proof of this great Accuſation.</p>
                        <p n="92">92. Let us come now to the ſecond ſimilitude of your making: in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance whereunto you tell us, that from the <hi>Monaſtery D.</hi> Potter <hi>is fled to an Hoſpital of perſons Univerſally infected with ſome diſeaſe, where he finds to be true, what you ſuppoſed, that, after his departure from his Brethren, he might fall into greater inconveniences, and more infectious diſeaſes than thoſe for which he left them.</hi> Thus you. But, to deal truly with you, I find nothing of all this, nor how it is conſequent from any thing ſaid by you, or done by D. <hi>Potter.</hi> But this I find, that you have compoſed this your ſimilitude as you did the former, of a heap of vain Suſpitions, pretended to be grounded on our confeſſions. As firſt, that <hi>your diſeaſes which we forſook, neither were nor could be mortal:</hi> whereas we aſſure our ſelves and are ready to juſtifie, that they are and were mortal in themſelves, and would have been ſo to us, if, when <hi>light came to us, we had loved darkneſs more than light.</hi> And D. <hi>Potter,</hi> though he hope your Church wanted no neceſſary vital part, that is, that ſome in your Church by ignorance might be ſaved; yet he nothing doubts but that it is full of ulcers without, and diſeaſes within, and is far from ſo extenuating your errors as to make them only like the ſuperfluous fingers of the gyant of <hi>Gath.</hi> Secondly, <hi>that we had no hope to avoyd other diſeaſes like thoſe for which we forſook your company, nor to be ſecure out of it from damnable errors:</hi> whereas the hope hereof was the only motive of our departure; and we aſſure our ſelves that the means to be ſecured from damnable error, is not to be ſecure as you are, but carefully to uſe thoſe means of avoyding it, to which God hath promiſed, and will never fail to give a bleſſing. Thirdly, that <hi>thoſe innumerable miſchiefs which followed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the departure of Proteſtants, were cauſed by it as by a proper cauſe:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as their doctrin was no otherwiſe the occaſion of them, than the Goſpel of Chriſt of the diviſion of the world. The only fountain of all theſe miſchiefs, being indeed no other than your pouring out a flood of perſecutions againſt Proteſtants, only becauſe they would not ſin and be damn'd with you for company.

                        <p n="93">93. But you proceed; and falling into a fit of admiration, crie out and ſay thus, <hi>To what paſs hath Hereſie brought men, who bluſh not to compare the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Spouſe of the Lord, the only Dove,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to a Monaſtery that muſt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken; to the gyant in Gath with ſuperfluous fingers!</hi> But this <hi>Spouſe of Chriſt,</hi> this only <hi>Dove,</hi> this <hi>purchaſe of our Saviours blood,</hi> this <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> which you thus almoſt deifie, what is it but a Society of men, whereof every particular, and by conſequence, the whole company is or may be
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:64345:148"/>guilty of many ſins daily committed againſt knowledge and conſcience? Now I would fain underſtand why one error in faith, eſpecially if not fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, ſhould not conſiſt with the holineſs of this Spouſe, this Dove, this Church, as well as many and great ſins committed againſt knowledge and conſcience? If this be not to ſtrain at gnats and ſwollow camels, I would fain underſtand what it is! And here, by the way, I deſire you to conſider whether as it were with one ſtroke of a ſpunge you do not wipe out all that you have ſaid, to prove Proteſtants Schiſmatiques for ſeparating from your Church, though ſuppoſed to be in ſome errors not fundamental! <hi>For if any ſuch error may make her deſerve to be compared to a Monaſtery ſo diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it muſt be forſaken;</hi> then if you ſuppoſe (as here you do) your Church in ſuch errors, your Church is ſo diſordered that it muſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without queſtion may, be forſaken, I mean in thoſe her diſorders and corruptions, and no farther.</p>
                        <p n="94">94. And yet you have not done with thoſe ſimilitudes, <hi>But muſt obſerve</hi> (you ſay) <hi>one thing, and that is, That as theſe Reformers of the Monaſtery, and others who left the diſeaſed company, could not deny but that they left the ſaid communities: So</hi> Luther <hi>and the reſt cannot pretend, not to have left the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church. And that D.</hi> Potter <hi>ſpeaks very ſtrangely when he ſayes, In a ſociety of men univerſally infected with ſome diſeaſe, they that ſhould free themſelves from the common diſeaſe, could not be therefore ſaid to ſeparate from the ſociety. For if they do not ſeparate themſelves from the ſociety of the infected perſons, how do they free themſelves frrom the common diſeaſe?</hi> To which I anſwer: That indeed, if you ſpeak of the Reformers of a Monaſtery and of the Deſertors of the diſeaſed company, as you put the caſes, that is, of thoſe which left theſe communities, then is it as true as Goſpel, that they cannot deny but that they left the ſaid communities. But it appears not to me, how it will enſue hereupon, That <hi>Luther</hi> and the reſt cannot pretend not to have left the viſible Church. For, to my apprehenſion, this argument is very weak,</p>
                        <p>They which left ſome communities cannot truly deny but that they left them; therefore <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers cannot deny but that they left the viſible Church.</p>
                        <p>Where, me thinks, you prove little, but take for granted that which is one of the greateſt Queſtions amongſt us, that is, That the Company which <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> left, was the whole Viſible Church: whereas you know we ſay, It was but a part of it, and that corrupted, and obſtinate in her corruptions. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers left off the Practice of thoſe Corruptions wherein the whole Viſible Church did communicate formerly, (which I meant when I acknowledg'd above that they forſook the external Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Viſible Church,) or that they left that part of the Viſible Church in her corruptions which would not be reformed: Theſe things, if you deſire, I ſhall be willing to grant; and that, by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> of the whole for the part, he might be ſaid to forſake the Viſible Church, that is, a part of it, and the greater part. But that, properly ſpeaking, he forſook the whole Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, I hope you will excuſe me if I grant not this, until you bring better proof of it, than your former ſimilitude. And my reaſon is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he and his Followers were a part of this Church, and ceaſed not to be ſo by the Reformation. Now he and his followers certainly forſook not themſelves, Therefore not every part of the Church, Therefore not the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:64345:149"/>whole Church. But then if you ſpeak of D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s caſes, according as he put them, and anſwer not your own Arguments, when you make ſhew of anſwering his: me-thinks, it ſhould not be ſo unreaſonable as you make it, for the perſons he ſpeaks of to deny that they left the Communities whereof they were Members. For example, that the Monks of Saint <hi>Benets</hi> Order make one Body, wherof their ſeveral Monaſteries are ſeveral members, I preſume it will be eaſily granted. Suppoſe now, that all theſe Monaſteries being quite out of Order, ſome 20. or 30. of them ſhould reform themſelves, the reſt perſiſting ſtill in their irregular courſes: were it ſuch a monſtrous impudence as you make it, for theſe Monaſteries, which we ſuppoſe refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, to deny that they forſook their Order or the Community whereof they were parts? In my Opinion it is no ſuch matter. Let the world judge. Again, whereas the Doctor ſaies, <hi>that in a Society of men Vniverſally infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome diſeaſe, they that ſhould free them ſelves from the common diſeaſe, could not therefore be ſaid to ſeparate from the Society:</hi> It is very ſtrange to me that you ſhould ſay, he ſpeaks very ſtrangely. Truly, Sir, I am extreamly deceived if his words be not plain Engliſh, and plain ſenſe, and contain ſuch a manifeſt Truth as cannot be denied with modeſty, nor gone about to be proved without vanity. For whatſoever is proved, muſt be proved by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But (ſay you) if they dot no ſeparate themſelves from the Society of the wicked perſons, how do they free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the common diſeaſe? Do they at the ſame time remain in the company and yet depart from thoſe infected creatures? Me thinks, a Writer of Controverſies ſhould not be ignorant how this may be done without any ſuch difficulty! But if you do not know, I'le tell you, There is no neceſſity they ſhould leave the company of theſe infected perſons at all: much leſs, that they ſhould at once depart from it and remain with it, which I confeſs were very difficult. But if they will free themſelves from their diſeaſe, let them ſtay were they are, and take phyſick. Or if you would be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed how this ſtrange thing may be done, learn from your ſelf, <hi>They may free their own perſons from the common diſeaſe, yet ſo that they remain ſtill in the company infected, eating and drinking with them, &amp;c.</hi> Which are your own words within four or five lines after this: plainly ſhewing that your miſtaking D. <hi>Potter's</hi> meaning, and your wondring at his words as at ſome ſtrange monſter's, was all this while affected, and that you are conſcious to your ſelf of perverting his Argument that you may ſeem to ſay ſomething, when indeed you ſay nothing. Whereas therefore you add, <hi>We muſt then ſay that they ſeparate themſelves from the perſons, though it be by occaſion of the diſeaſe;</hi> I aſſure you, good Sir, you muſt not do ſo at any hand; for then you alter and ſpoil D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s caſe quite, and fight not with his reaſon but your own ſhadow. For the Inſtanceof <hi>a man freeing himſelf from the diſeaſe of his company, and not leaving his company,</hi> is very fit to prove, by the parity of reaſon, that it is very poſſible, a man may leave the corruptions of a Church, and not leave the Church, that is, not ceaſe to be a member of it: But yours <hi>of a man leaving his company by occaſion of their diſeaſe,</hi> hath no analogy at all with this buſineſs.</p>

95. But <hi>Luther and his followers did not continue in the company of thoſe from whoſe diſeaſes they pretend to free themſelves.</hi> Very true, neither was it ſaid they did ſo. There is no neceſſity that that which is compared to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing ſhould agree with it in all things: it is ſufficient, if it agree in that wherein it is compared. A man freeing himſelf from the common diſeaſe of a ſociety, and yet continuing a part of it, is here compared to <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers, freeing themſelves from the corruptions of the viſible Church, and continuing a part of the Church. As for accompanying the other parts of it in all things, it was neither neceſſary, nor without deſtroying our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of their forſaking the corruptions of the Church, poſſible. Not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; for they may be parts of the Church which do not joyn with other parts of it in all obſervances. Nor poſſible, for had he accompanied them in all things, he had not freed himſelf from the common corruptions.</p>
                        <p n="96">96. But <hi>they indeavoured to force the ſociety whereof they were parts, to be healed and reformed as they were; and, if it refuſed, they did, when they had power, drive them away, even their ſuperiours both Spiritual and Temporal, as is notorious.</hi> The proofs hereof are wanting, and therefore I might deferr my anſwer untill they were produced; yet take this before hand: If they did ſo, then herein, in my opinion, they did amiſs; for I have learnt from the ancient Fathers of the Church, that <hi>nothing is more againſt Religion than to force Religion;</hi> and of S. <hi>Paul, The weapons of the Chriſtian warfare are not carnal.</hi> And great reaſon: For, humane violence may make men counterfeit, but cannot make them believe, and is therefore fit for nothing but to breed form without, and Atheiſm within. Beſides, if this means of bringing men to embrace any Religion were generally uſed (as if it may be juſtly uſed in any place by thoſe that have power, and think they have truth, certainly they cannot with reaſon deny but that it may be uſed in every place, by thoſe that have power as well as they, and think they have truth as well as they,) what could follow but the maintenance perhaps of truth, but perhaps only of the profeſsion of it in one place, and the oppreſsion of it in a hundred? What will follow from it but the preſervation peradventure of unity, but peradventure only of uniformity, in particular States and Churches; but the immortalizing the greater &amp; more lamentable diviſions of Chriſtendom and the world? And therefore what can follow from it, but perhaps in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of carnal policy, the temporal benefit and tranquillity of temporal States and Kingdoms, but the infinite prejudice, if not the deſolation, of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt? And therefore it well becomes them who have have their portions in this life, who ſerve no higher State than that of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> nor this neither any further than they may ſerve themſelves by it; who think of no other happineſs but the preſervation of their own fortunes and tranquillity in this world; who think of no other means to preſerve States, but human power and Machivilian policy, and believe no other Creed but this, <hi>Regi aut Civitati imperium habenti nihil injuſtum, quod utile!</hi> Such men as theſe it may become to maintain by worldly power and violence their State-inſtrument, Religion. For if all be vain and falſe, (as in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is) the preſent whatſoever, is better than any, becauſe it is already ſetled: an alteration of it may draw with it change of States, and the change of State the ſubverſion of their fortune. But they that are indeed ſervants and lovers of Chriſt, of Truth, of the Church, and of Mankind, ought with all courage to oppoſe themſelves againſt it, as a common enemy of all theſe.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:64345:150"/>They that know there is a King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, by whoſe will and pleaſure Kings and Kingdoms ſtand and fall, they know, that to no King or State any thing can be profitable which is unjuſt; and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more evidently unjuſt, than to force weak men by the profeſſion of a Religion which they believe not, to loſe their own eternal happineſs, out of a vain and needleſs fear, leſt they may poſſibly diſturb their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral quietneſs. There being no danger to any State from any mans opinion; unleſs it be ſuch an opinion by which diſobedience to authority, or impiety, is taught or licenc'd: which ſort, I confeſs, may juſtly be puniſhed as well as other faults; or, unleſs this ſanguinary doctrin be joyn'd with it, That it is lawful for him by human violence to enforce others to it. Therefore if Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants did offer violence to other mens conſciences and compel them to embrace their Reformation, I excuſe them not: much leſs, if they did ſo to the ſacred Perſons of Kings, and thoſe that were in authority over them, who ought to be ſo ſecur'd from violence, that even their unjuſt und ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous violence, though it may be avoided (according to that of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>When they perſecute you in one City flie into another,</hi>) yet may it not be reſiſted by oppoſing violence againſt it. Proteſtants therefore that were guilty of this crime are not to be excuſed, and bleſſed had they been had they choſen rather to be Martyrs than Murderers, &amp; to die for their religion rather than to fight for it. But of all the men in the world you are moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to accuſe them hereof, againſt whom the ſouls of the Martyrs from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Altar cry much lowder than againſt all their other Perſecutors to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: Who for theſe many ages together have daily ſacrificed <hi>Hecatombs</hi> of innocent Chriſtians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under the name of Heretiques, to blind zeal and furious ſuperſtition. Who teach plainly, that you may propagate your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whenſoever you have power, by depoſing of Kings and invaſion of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and think when you kill the adverſaries of it, you <hi>do God good ſervice.</hi> But for their departing corporally from them, whom mentally they had forſaken: For their forſaking the external Communion and company of the unreformed part of the Church, in their ſuperſtitions and impieties: thus much of your accuſation we embrace and glory in it; And ſay, though ſome Proteſtants might offend in the maner or degree of their ſeparation, yet certainly their ſeparation it ſelf was not Schiſmatical, but innocent; and not only ſo, but juſt and neceſſary. And as for your obtruding upon D. <hi>Potter</hi> that he ſhould ſay, <hi>There neither was nor could be juſt cauſe to do ſo, no more than to depart from Chriſt himſelf.</hi> I have ſhewed divers times already, that you deal very injuriouſly with him, confounding together, <hi>Departing from the Church,</hi> and <hi>Departing from ſome general opinions and practiſes,</hi> which did not conſtitute but vitiate, not make the Church but marr it. For though he ſaies, that which is moſt true, that <hi>there can be no juſt cauſe to depart from the Church,</hi> that is, to ceaſe being a member of the Church, <hi>no more than to depart from Chriſt himſelf,</hi> in as much as theſe are not divers but the ſame thing; yet he nowhere denies, but there might be juſt and neceſſary cauſe to depart from ſome opinions and practices of your Church, nay of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church.

Which, to what purpoſe is it, when both the parties litigant are agreed that many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors were held by many of the ancient Doctors, much more ancient than any of thoſe who are pretended to be confeſſed by Proteſtants to have held with you in this matter: and when thoſe whom you have to do with, and whom it is vain to diſpute againſt but out of Principles received by them, are all peremptory, that though novelty be a certain note of falſhood, yet no Antiquity leſs than Apoſtolical, is a certain note of truth? Yet this I ſay, not as if I did acknowledge what you pretend, that Proteſtants did confeſs the Fathers againſt them in this point. For the point here iſſuable is not, Whether S. <hi>Peter</hi> were head of the Church? Nor, whether the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had any priority in the Church? Nor, whether he had authority over it given him by the Church? But whether by Divine right, and by Chriſts appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he were Head of the Catholique Church? Now having peruſed <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ely,</hi> I cannot find any one Proteſtant confeſſing any one Father to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in opinion with you in this point. And the Reader hath reaſon to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that you alſo out of all the Fathers could not find any one authority pertinent to this purpoſe: for otherwiſe you were much to blame, citing ſo few, to make choice of ſuch as are impertinent. For let the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reader peruſe the 55. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> with any ordinary attention, out of which you take your firſt place, and I am confident he ſhall find that he means nothing elſe by the words quoted by you, But that in one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church at one time there ought to be but one Biſhop, and that he ſhould be obeyed in all things lawful: The non-performance whereof, was one of the moſt ordinary cauſes of Hereſies againſt the Faith, and Schiſm from the Communion of the Church Univerſal. He ſhall find, ſecondly, and that by many convincing Arguments, that though he write to <hi>Cornelius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet he ſpeaks not of him, but of himſelf then Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> againſt whom a faction of Schiſmatiques had then ſet up another. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here your ingenuity is to be commended above many of your ſide: For whereas they ordinarily abuſe this place to prove, that in the whole Church there ought to be but one Prieſt &amp; one Judge; you ſeem ſomwhat diffident hereof, and thereupon ſay, <hi>That theſe words plainly condemn</hi> Luther, <hi>whether he will underſtand them as ſpoken of the Univerſal, or of every Particular Church.</hi> But whether they condemn <hi>Luther,</hi> is another queſtion. The queſtion here is, Whether they plainly prove the Pope's Supremacy over all other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops? which certainly they are as far from proving, as from proving the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy of any other Biſhop: ſeeing it is evident they were intended not of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:64345:151"/>one Biſhop over the whole Catholique Church, but of one Biſhop in one particular Church.</p>
                        <p n="99">99. And no leſs impertinent is your ſaying out of <hi>Optatus,</hi> if it be well lookt into, though at the firſt ſight it may ſeem otherwiſe; becauſe <hi>Optatus</hi> his ſcene happened to be <hi>Rome,</hi> whereas S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> was <hi>Carthage.</hi> The truth is, the Donatiſts had ſet up at <hi>Rome</hi> a Biſhop of their faction: not with intent to make him Biſhop of the whole Church but of that Church in particular. Now <hi>Optatus</hi> going upon S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> above-mentioned ground of <hi>one Biſhop in one Church,</hi> proves them Schiſmatiques for ſo doing, and he proves it by this Argument: S. <hi>Peter</hi> was firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> neither did the Apoſtles attribute to themſelves each one his particular Chair, (underſtand <hi>in that City;</hi> for in other places others, I hope, had Chairs beſides S. <hi>Peter</hi>) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is a Schiſmatique, who againſt that one ſingle Chair erects another (underſtand as before, <hi>in that place</hi>) making another Biſhop of that Dioceſs beſides him who was lawfully elected to it.</p>

But <hi>yet by the way he ſtyles S.</hi> Peter <hi>head of the Apoſtles, and ſays, that from thence he was called</hi> Cephas. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Perhaps he was abuſed into this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, by thinking <hi>Cephas</hi> derived from the <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>a head:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is a <hi>Syriack</hi> word and ſignifies <hi>a ſtone.</hi> Beſides, S. <hi>Peter</hi> might be head of the Apoſtles, that is, firſt in order and honour among them, and not have Supreme Authority over them. And indeed that S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould have Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over all the Apoſtles, and yet exerciſe no one act of Authority over any one of them, and that they ſhould ſhew to him no ſign of ſubjection, me-thinks is as ſtrange, as that a King of <hi>England</hi> for twenty five years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſhould do no Act of Regality, nor receive any one acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. As ſtrange methinks it is, that you, ſo many ages after, ſhould know this ſo certainly, as you pretend to do, and that the Apoſtles (after that thoſe words were ſpoken in their hearing, by vertue whereof S. <hi>Peter</hi> is pretended to have been made their head,) ſhould ſtill be ſo ignorant of it, as to queſtion <hi>which of them ſhould be the greateſt?</hi> yet more ſtrange, that our Saviour ſhould not bring them out of their error, by telling them S. <hi>Peter</hi> was the man, but rather confirm it by ſaying, <hi>the Kings of the Gentiles exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe authority over them, but it ſhould not be ſo among them.</hi> No leſs a wonder was it that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould ſo far forget S. <hi>Peter</hi> and himſelf, as that, firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of him often, he ſhould do it without any title of Honour. Secondly, ſpeaking of the ſeveral degrees of men in the Church, he ſhould not give S. <hi>Peter</hi> the higheſt, but place him in equipage with the reſt of the Apoſtles, and ſay, <hi>God hath appointed</hi> (not <hi>firſt Peter, then the reſt</hi> of the Apoſtles, but) <hi>firſt Apoſtles, ſecondly Prophets.</hi> Certainly, if the Apoſtles were <hi>all firſt,</hi> to me it is very probable, that no one of them was before the reſt. For by <hi>Firſt,</hi> all men underſtand either that which is before all, or that before which is nothing. Now in the former ſenſe, the Apoſtles could not be all firſt, for then every one of them muſt have been before every one of the reſt. And therefore they muſt be <hi>Firſt</hi> in the other ſenſe. And therefore No man, and therefore Not S. <hi>Peter,</hi> muſt be before any of them. Thirdly and Laſtly, that ſpeaking of himſelf in particular, and perhaps comparing himſelf with S. <hi>Peter</hi> in particular, rather than any other, he ſhould ſay in plain terms, <hi>I am in nothing inferior to the very chiefeſt Apoſtles.</hi> But beſides all this, Though we ſhould grant, againſt all theſe probabilities and many more, that <hi>Optatus</hi> meant that S. <hi>Peter</hi> was head of the Apoſtles,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:64345:151"/>not in our but in your ſenſe, and that S. <hi>Peter</hi> indeed was ſo; yet ſtill you are very farr from ſhewing, that in the judgement of <hi>Optatus,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> was to be at all, much leſs by divine right, ſucceſſor to S. <hi>Peter</hi> in this his Headſhip and Authority. For what incongruity is there, if we ſay, that he might ſucceed S. <hi>Peter</hi> in that part of his care, the government of that particular Church, (as ſure he did even while S, <hi>Peter</hi> was living,) and yet that neither he nor any man was to ſucceed him in his Apoſtleſhip, nor in his government of the Church Univerſal? Eſpecially ſeeing S. <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles, by laying the foundations of the Church, were to be the <hi>Foundations of it,</hi> and accordingly are ſo called in Scripture. And therefore as in a Building it is incongruous that Foundations ſhould ſucceed Foundations: So it may be in the Church, that any other Apoſtles ſhould ſucceed the firſt.</p>
                        <p n="101">101. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 37. The next Paragraph I might well paſs over, as having no Argument in it. For there is nothing in it but two ſayings of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> which I have great reaſon to eſteem no Argument, untill you will promiſe me, to grant whatſoever I ſhall prove by two ſayings of S. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> But moreover, the ſecond of theſe ſentences ſeems to me, to imply the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the firſt. For to ſay, <hi>That the Sacriledge of Schiſm, is eminent, when there is no cauſe of ſeparation,</hi> implies, to my underſtanding, that there may be a cauſe of Separation. Now in the firſt, he ſays plainly, <hi>That this is impoſsible.</hi> Neither doth any reconciliation of his words occurre to me, but only this, that in the former he ſpeaks upon ſuppoſition, that the Publique ſervice of God, wherein men are to communicate is unpolluted, and no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful thing practiced in their communion, which was ſo true of their communion, that the Donatiſts who ſeparated did not deny it. And to make this anſwer no improbable evaſion, it is obſervable out of S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> that though the Donatiſts, at the beginning of their Separation, pretended no cauſe of it, but only that the men from whom they ſeparated, were defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the contagion of Traditors; yet afterwards, to make the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it more juſtifiable, they did invent and ſpread abroad this calumny againſt Catholiques, that they ſet pictures upon their altars: which when S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> comes to Anſwer, he does not deny the poſsibility of the thing, for that had been to deny the Catholique Church to be made up of men, all which had free-will to evil, and therefore might poſsibly agree in doing it, and, had he denyed this, the Action of after-Ages had been his refutation; Neither does he ſay, (as you would have done,) that it was true, they placed pictures there, and moreover worſhipped them, but yet not for their own ſakes, but for theirs who were repreſented by them: Neither does he ſay, (as you do in this Chapter) that though this were granted a Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet were they not to ſeparate for it. What then does he? Certainly nothing elſe, but abhorr the thing, and deny the imputation: Which way of anſwering, does not, I confeſs, plainly ſhew, but yet it ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, that he had nothing elſe to anſwer; and that if he could not have denyed this, he could not have denyed the Donatiſts ſeparation from them to have been juſt. If this Anſwer to this litle Argument ſeem not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, I add moreover, that if it be applyed to <hi>Luther</hi>'s ſeparation, it hath the common fault of all your Allegations out of Fathers, Impertinence. For it is one thing to ſeparate from the communion of the whole world, another to ſeparate form all the Communions in the world: One thing to
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:64345:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>divide from them who are united among themſelves, another to divide from them who are divided among themſelves. Now the Donatiſts ſeparated from the whole world of Chriſtians, united in one Communion, profeſſing the ſame Faith, ſerving God after the ſame maner, which was a very great Argument, that they could not have juſt cauſe to leave them: according to that of <hi>Tertullian, Variâſſe debuer at error Eccleſiarum; quod autem apud mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos unum eſt, non eſt Erratum ſed Traditum.</hi> But <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers did not ſo. The world, I mean of Chriſtians and Catholiques, was divided and ſubdivided long before he divided from it; and by their diviſions had much weakned their own authority, and taken away from you this plea of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> which ſtands upon no other Foundation, but the Unity of the whole worlds Communion.</p>
                        <p n="102">102. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 38. If <hi>Luther were in the right, moſt certain thoſe Proteſtants that differed from him were in the wrong:</hi> But that either he or they were Schiſmatiques, it follows not. Or if it does, then either the Jeſuits are Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques from the Dominicans, or they from the Jeſuits; The Canoniſts from the Jeſuits, or the Jeſuits from the Canoniſts: The Scotiſts from the Thomiſts, or they from the Scotiſts: The Franciſcans from the Dominicans, or the Dominicans from the Franciſcans. For between all theſe the world knows that, in point of Doctin, there is a plain and irreconcileable contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; and therefore one Part muſt be in error, at leaſt not Fundamental. Thus your Argument returns upon your ſelf, and, if it be good, proves the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in a manner to be made up of Schiſmatiques. But the anſwer to it, is, that it begges this very falſe and vain Suppoſition; That whoſoever in any point of doctrin is a Schiſmatique.</p>
                        <p n="103">103. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 39. In the next place you number up your victories, and tell us, <hi>that out of theſe premiſes, this concluſion follows, That</hi> Luther <hi>and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers were Schiſmatiques from the Viſible Church, the Pope, the Dioceſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were baptized; from the Biſhop under whom they lived, from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to which they belonged; from their Religious order, wherein they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed; from one another, and laſtly, from a mans ſelf: Becauſe the ſelf ſame Proteſtant is convicted to day, that his yeſterdayes opinion was an error.</hi> To which I Anſwer, that <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers ſeparated from many of theſe, in ſome opinions and practices: But that they did it without cauſe, which only can make them Schiſmatiques, that was the only thing you ſhould have prov'd, and to that you have not urged one reaſon of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. All of them for weight and ſtrength were coſen-germans to this pretty device, wherewith you will prove them Schiſmatiques from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>becauſe the ſelf ſame Proteſtant to day is convicted in conſcience, that his yeſterdayes opinion was an error.</hi> It ſeems then, that they that hold errors, muſt hold them faſt, and take ſpecial care of being convicted in conſcience that they are in error, for fear of being Schiſmatiques! Proteſtants muſt continue Proteſtants, and Puritans Puritans, and Papiſts Papiſts; nay Jewes, and Turks, and Pagans, muſt remain Jews, and Turks, and Pagans, and go on conſtantly to the Devil, or elſe, forſooth, they muſt be <hi>Schiſmatiques</hi> and that <hi>from themſelves.</hi> And this perhaps is the cauſe that makes Papiſts ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, not only in their common ſuperſtition, but alſo in adhering to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per phancies of their ſeveral Sects: ſo that it is a miracle to hear of any Jeſuit that hath forſaken the opinion of the Jeſuits, or any Dominican that hath chang'd his for the Jeſuits. Whithout queſtion, this Gentleman my adverſary
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:64345:152"/>knows none ſuch, or elſe methinks he ſhould not have objected it to D. <hi>Potter, That he knew a man in the world, who, from a Puritan, was turned to a moderate Proteſtant,</hi> which is likely to be true. But ſure, if this be all his fault, he hath no reaſon to be aſhamed of his acquaintance. For poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly it may be a fault to be in errour, becauſe many times it proceeds from a fault: But ſure, the forſaking of errour cannot be a ſin, unleſs to be in errour be a vertue. And therefore to do as you do, to damn men for falſe opinions, and to call them Schiſmatiques for leaving them; to make perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy in errour, that is, an unwillingneſs to be convicted, or a reſolution not to be convicted, the form of Hereſie, and to find fault with men, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convicted in conſcience that they are in error, is the moſt incoherent and contradictious injuſtice that ever was heard of. But Sir, if this be a ſtrange matter to you, that which I ſhall tell you will be much ſtranger. I know a man that of a moderate Proteſtant turn'd a Papiſt, and, the day that he did ſo, (as all things that are done are perfected ſome day or other,) and yet thinks he was no Schiſmatique for doing ſo, and deſires to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by you, whether or no he was miſtaken? The ſame man after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, upon better conſideration, became a doubting Papiſt, and of a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Papiſt a confirm'd Proteſtant. And yet this man thinks himſelf no more to blame for all theſe changes, than a Travailer, who uſing all diligence to find the right way to ſome remote City, where he had never been, (as the party I ſpeak of had never been in Heaven,) did yet miſtake it, and after find his error, and amend it. Nay, he ſtands upon his juſtification ſo far as to maintain that his alterations, not only to you, but alſo from you by Gods mercy, were the moſt ſatisfactory actions to himſelf, that ever he did, and the greateſt victories that ever he obtained over himſelf, and his affections to thoſe things which in this world are moſt pretious; as wherein for Gods ſake, and (as he was verily perſwaded,) out of love to the Truth, he went upon a cerain expectation of thoſe inconveniences, which to ingenuous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are of all moſt terrible. So that though there were much weakneſs in ſome of theſe alterations, yet certainly there was no wickedneſs. Neither does he yield his weakneſs altogether without Apologie, ſeeing his dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were rational, and out of ſome Principles commonly received by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants as well as Papiſts, and which by his education had got poſſeſſion of his underſtanding.</p>

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:64345:153"/>what more particularly: I ſay your whole diſcourſe againſt it, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of <hi>falſhoods</hi> and <hi>impertinencies.</hi> The firſt falſhood is, that he in theſe words avoucheth, <hi>that no learned Catholiques can be ſaved:</hi> Unleſs you will ſuppoſe, that all learned Catholiques are convinc'd in conſcience, that your Church errs in many things. It may well be fear'd that many are ſo convinc'd, and yet profeſs what they believe not. Many more have been, and have ſtifled their conſciences, by thinking it an act of humility, to do ſo.

For in the beginning of this Anſwer you tell us, that the <hi>Doctor avouches of all Catholiques whom ignorance cannot excuſe, that they cannot be ſaved.</hi> Certainly then he muſt needs eſteem them to want ſomething neceſſary to Salvation.

A Third is, that theſe <hi>Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Roman Errors are in themſelves not damnable, and yet it is damnable for me (who know them to be errors,) to hold and confeſs them, are abſolutely inconſiſtent;</hi> which is falſe; for, be the matter what it will, yet for a man to tell a lie, eſpecially in matter of Religion, cannot but be damnable. How much more then, to go on in a courſe of lying by profeſſing to believe theſe things divine Truths, which he verily believes to be falſhoods and fables? A fourth is, that <hi>if we erred in thinking that your Church holds errors, this error or erroneous conſcience might be rectified and depoſed, by judging thoſe errors not damnable.</hi> For, what repugnance is there between theſe two Suppoſitions, that, you do hold ſome errors, and, that they are not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable? And if there be no repugnance between them, how can the belief of the later remove or deſtroy, or it be erroneous, rectifie the belief of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer? Nay ſeeing there is a manifeſt conſent between them, how can it be avoided, but the belief of the later will maintain and preſerve the belief of the former? For who can conjoyn in one brain not crackt, (pardon me, if I ſpeak to you in your own words,) theſe Aſſertions, In the <hi>Roman</hi> Church there are errors not damnable; and, In the <hi>Roman</hi> Church there are no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors at all? Or what ſober underſtanding would ever think this a good col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, I eſteem the errors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church not damnable, therefore I do amiſs to think that ſhe erres at all? If therefore you would have us alter our judgement, that your Church is erroneous; your only way is to ſhew, your doctrin conſonant, at leaſt not evidently repugnant, to Scripture and Reaſon. For as for this device, this ſhort cut of perſwading our ſelves that you hold no errors, becauſe we believe your errors are not damnable, aſſure your ſelf it will never hold.</p>

106. A fifth falſhood is, <hi>That we daily do this favour for Proteſtants</hi> you muſt mean (if you ſpeak conſequently) to judge <hi>they have no errors, becauſe we judge they have none damnable.</hi> Which the world knows to be moſt untrue. And for our continuing in their communion notwithſtanding their errors, the juſtification hereof is not ſo much, that their errors are not dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: as that they require not the belief and profeſſion of theſe errors among the conditions of their communion. Which puts a main difference between them and you: becauſe we may continue in their communion without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to believe their opinions, but in yours we cannot. A fixt is, that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Doctrin of all Divines, there is any difference between a Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Perſwaſion of conſcience, of the unlawfulneſs of any thing, and a Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Dictamen that the ſame thing is unlawful.</hi> For theſe are but diverſe words ſignifying the ſame thing; neither is ſuch perſwaſion wholly ſpeculative, but tending to practice: nor ſuch a dictamen wholly practical, but grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſpeculation. A ſeventh is, <hi>That Proteſtants did only conceive in ſpeculation that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>erred in ſome doctrins,</hi> and had not alſo a practical dictamen, that it was damnable for them to continue in the profeſſion of theſe errors. An eighth is, that <hi>it is not lawful to ſeparate from any Churches communion, for errors not appertaning to the ſubſtance of Faith:</hi> Which is not univerſally true, but with this exception, unleſs that Church requires the belief and profeſſion of them. The ninth is, that D. <hi>Potter teacheth, that</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>was bound to forſake the houſe of God, for an unneceſſary light.</hi> Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted manifeſtly by D. <hi>Potter</hi> in this very place, for by the houſe of God you mean the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and of her the Doctor ſaies, <hi>That a neceſsity did lie upon him, even under pain of damnation, to forſake the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>in her errors.</hi> This ſure is not to ſay, that he was obliged to forſake her, for an unneceſſary light. The tenth is covertly vented in your intimation, <hi>That</hi> Luther <hi>and his followers were the proper cauſe of the Chriſtian worlds Combuſtion:</hi> Whereas indeed the true cauſe of this lamentable effect, was your violent perſecution of them, for ſerving God according to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which if it be done to you, you condemn of horrible impiety, and therefore may not hope to be excuſed, if you do it to others.</p>
                        <p n="107">107. The eleventh is, that our <hi>firſt reformers ought to have doubted whether their opinions were certain.</hi> Which is to ſay, that they ought to have doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the certainty of Scripture: which in formal and expreſs terms, contains many of theſe opinions. And the reaſon of this aſſertion is very vain: <hi>for though they had not an abſolute infallibility promiſed unto them,</hi> yet may they be of ſome things infallibly certain. As <hi>Euclide</hi> ſure was not infallible, yet was he certain enough, that <hi>twice two were four,</hi> and <hi>that every whole was greater than a part of that whole.</hi> And ſo though <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Melancthon</hi> were not infallible in all things, yet they might and did know well enough, that your Latine Service was condemned by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in both kinds was taught by our Saviour. The twelfth and laſt is this, that <hi>your Church was in peaceable poſſeſsion</hi> (you muſt mean of her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, and the Profeſſors of it,) <hi>and enjoyed preſcription for many ages.</hi> For, beſides that Doctrin is not a thing that may be poſſeſſed: And the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of it were the Church it ſelf, and in nature of poſſeſſors, (If we ſpeak improperly,) rather than the thing poſſeſſed, with whom no man hath reaſon to be offended, if they think fit to quit their own poſſeſſion: I ſay that the poſſeſſion, which the governours of your Church held for ſome
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:64345:154"/>ages, of the party governed, was not peaceable, but got by fraud, and held by violence.</p>
                        <p n="108">108. Theſe are the <hi>Falſhoods</hi> which in this Anſwer offer themſelves to any attentive Reader, and that which remains is meer <hi>impertinence.</hi> As firſt, that <hi>a pretence of conſcience will not ſerve to juſtifie Separation, from being Schiſmatical.</hi> Which is true, but little to the purpoſe, ſeeing it was not an erroneous perſwaſion, much leſs an Hypocritical pretence, but a true and well grounded conviction of conſcience, which D. <hi>Potter</hi> alleaged to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Proteſtants from being Schiſmatical. And therefore though ſeditious men in Church and State, may pretend conſcience, for a cloak of their rebellion: yet this, I hope, hinders not, but that an honeſt man ought to obey his rightly informed conſcience, rather than the unjuſt commands of his tyrannous Superiours. Otherwiſe, With what colour can you defend either your own refuſing the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy? or the ancient Martyrs, and Apoſtles, and Prophets, who oftentimes diſobeyed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of men in authority, and for their diſobedience made no other but this Apology, <hi>We muſt obey God rather than men?</hi> It is therefore moſt apparent that this anſwer muſt be meerly impertinent: ſeeing it will ſerve againſt the Martyrs and Apoſtles and Prophets, and even againſt your ſelves, as well as againſt Proteſtants. To as little purpoſe is your rule out of <hi>Lyrinenſis</hi> againſt them that followed <hi>Luther,</hi> ſeeing they pretend and are ready to juſtifie, that they forſook not, with the Doctors, the faith, but only the corruption of the Church. As vain altogether is that which followes: That <hi>in caſes of uncertainty we are not to leave our Superiour, or caſt off his obedience, nor publiquely oppoſe his decrees.</hi> From whence it will follow very evidently, that ſeeing it is not a matter of faith, but diſputed queſtion amongſt you, Whether the Oath of Allegeance be lawful: that either you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge not the King your Superior, or do againſt conſcience, in oppoſing his and the Kingdoms decree, requiring the taking of this Oath. This good uſe, I ſay, may very fairly be made of it, and is by men of your religion. But then it is ſo far from being a confutation, that it is rather a confirmation of D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s aſſertion. For he that uſeth theſe words, Doth he not plainly import (and ſuch was the caſe of Proteſtants) that we are to leave our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, to caſt off obedience to them, and publiquely, to oppoſe their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, when we are certain (as Proteſtants were,) that what they command, God doth countermand. Laſtly, S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> example is againſt Proteſtants impertinently, and even ridiculouſly, alleadged. <hi>For, what if S. Cyprian holding his opinion true but not neceſſary, condemned no man (much leſs any Church) for holding the contrary?</hi> Yet, me thinks, this ſhould lay no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon <hi>Luther</hi> to do ſo likwiſe: ſeeing he held his own opinions not only true but alſo neceſſary, and the doctrin of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church not only falſe but damnable. And therefore ſeeing the condition and ſtate of the parties cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> was ſo different, no marvel though their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures alſo were different according to the ſuppoſed merit of the parties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent. For as for your obtruding again upon us, <hi>That we believe the points of difference not Fundamental or neceſſary,</hi> you have been often told, that it is a Calumny. We hold your errors as damnable in themſelves as you do ours, only by accident through invincible ignorance, we hope they are not unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable: and you alſo profeſs to think the ſame of ours.</p>

109. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 42. The former part of this diſcourſe, grounded on D. <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s words <hi>p.</hi> 105. I have already in paſſing examined and confuted: I add in this place, 1. That though the Doctor ſay, <hi>It is not fit for any private man to oppoſe his judgement to the publique;</hi> that is, his own judgement and bare authority: yet he denies not, but occaſions may happen wherein it may be warrantable, to oppoſe his reaſon or the authority of Scripture againſt it; and is not then to be eſteem'd to oppoſe his own judggment to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, but the judgement of God to the judgement of men. Which his following words ſeem to import, <hi>He may offer his opinion to be conſidered of, ſo he do it with evidence or great probability of Scripture or Reaſon.</hi> Secondly, I am to tell you that you have no ground from him, to enterline his words with that Interrogatory <hi>(his own conceits, and yet grounded upon evidence of Scripture?)</hi> For theſe things are in his words oppoſed, and not confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the latter, not intended for a repetition (as you miſtake it) but for an Antitheſis of the former. <hi>He may offer</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>his opinion to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of, ſo he do it with evidence of Scripture. But if he will factiouſly advance his own conceits,</hi> (that is, ſay I, clean contrary to your gloſs,) <hi>Such as have not evident nor very probable ground in Scripture,</hi> (for theſe conceits are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his own) <hi>he may juſtly be branded, &amp;c.</hi> Now that this of the two is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gloſs, it is proved by your own interrogation. For that imputes abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to D. <hi>Potter,</hi> for calling them a mans <hi>own conceits,</hi> which were <hi>grounded upon evidence of Scripture.</hi> And therefore you have ſhewed little candour or equity, in faſtening upon them this abſurd conſtruction: They not only bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but even requiring another more fair and more ſenſible. Every man ought to be preſum'd to ſpeak ſenſe, rather than non-ſenſe; coherently, rather than contradictiouſly; if his words be fairly capable of a better conſtruction, For <hi>M. Hooker;</hi> if, writing againſt Puritans, he had ſaid ſomething unawares that might give advantage to Papiſts, it were not inexcuſable: ſeeing it is a matter of ſuch extream difficulty, to hold ſuch a temper in oppoſing one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream opinion, as not to ſeem to favour the other. Yet if his words be rightly conſider'd, there is nothing in them that will do you any ſervice. For though he ſaies that <hi>men are bound to do whatſoever the ſentence of finall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion ſhall determin,</hi> as it is plain me are bound to yield ſuch an obedience to all Courts of civil judicature: yet he ſaies not, they <hi>are bound to think</hi> that determination lawful, and that ſentence juſt. Nay it is plain he ſaies, that they <hi>muſt do according to the Judge's ſentence, though in their private opinion it ſeem unjuſt.</hi> As if I be caſt wrongfully in a ſuit at law, and ſentenced to pay an hundred pound, I am bound to pay the mony; yet I know no law of God or man, that binds me in conſcience to acquit the Judge of error in his ſentence. The queſtion therefore being only what men ought to think, it is vain for you to tell us what M. <hi>Hooker</hi> ſaies at all. For M. <hi>Hooker,</hi> though an excellant man, was but a man. And much more vain, to tell us out of him, what men ought to do, for point of external obedience. When, in the very ſame place, he ſuppoſeth and alloweth, that in their private opinion they may think, This ſentence to which they yield a paſsive obedience, to ſwarve utterly from that which is right. If you will draw his words to ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as if he had ſaid, <hi>they muſt think the ſentence of judicial and final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion juſt and right, though it ſeem in their private opinion to ſwerve utterly from what is right;</hi> It is manifeſt, you make him contradict himſelf, and make him ſay in effect, They muſt think thus, though at the ſame time they think
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:64345:155"/>the contrary. Neither is there any <hi>neceſsity, that he muſt either acknowledge the univerſal infallibility of the Church, or drive men into diſſembling againſt their conſcience,</hi> ſeeing nothing hinders, but I may obey the ſentence of a Judge paying the money he awards me to pay, or forgoing the houſe or land which he hath judged from me, and yet withall plainly profeſs, that in my conſcience I conceive his judgement erroneous. To which purpoſe, they have a ſaying in <hi>France,</hi> that <hi>whoſoever is caſt in any cauſe, hath liberty for ten daies after, to rayl at his Judges.</hi>

This anſwer to this place, the words themſelves offered me, even as they are alleaged by you: But upon peruſal of the place in the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, I find that here, as elſe-where, you and M. <hi>Brerely</hi> wrong him extreamly. For, mutilating his words, you make him ſay that abſolutely, which he there expreſly limits to ſome certain caſes. <hi>In litigious and controverted cauſes of ſuch a quality</hi> (ſaith he), <hi>the will of God is, to have them do whatſoever the ſentence of judicial and final Deciſion ſhall determine.</hi> Obſerve, I pray, He ſaies not abſolutely and in all cauſes, this is the will of God: But only <hi>in litigious cauſes, of the quality of thoſe whereof he there entreats.</hi> In ſuch matters, as have plain Scripture or Reaſon, neither for them nor againſt them, and wherein men are perſwaded this or that way, <hi>Upon their own only probable collection;</hi> In ſuch caſes, <hi>This perſwaſion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ought to be fully ſetled in mens hearts, that the will of God is, that they ſhould not diſobey the certain commands of their lawful ſuperiours, upon uncertain grounds: But do that which the ſentence of judicial and final deciſion ſhall determine.</hi> For the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, a Queſtion there is, Whether a Surplice may be worn in Divine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: The Authority of Superiours injoynes this Ceremony, and neither Scripture nor Reaſon plainly forbids it. <hi>Sempronius</hi> notwithſtanding, is, by ſome inducements, which he confeſſes to be only probable, let to this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that the thing is unlawful. The <hi>quaere</hi> is, Whether he ought for matter of practice to follow the injunction of authority, or his own private and only probable perſwaſion? M. <hi>Hooker</hi> reſolves for the former, upon this ground, that <hi>the certain commands of the Church we live in, are to be obeyed in all things, not certainly unlawful.</hi> Which rule is your own, and by you extended to the commands of all Superiors, in the very next Section before this, in theſe words, <hi>In caſes of uncertainty we are not to leave our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior, nor caſt off his obedience, or publiquely oppoſe his decrees.</hi> And yet, if a man ſhould conclude upon you, that either you make all Superiors univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally infallible, or elſe drive men into perplexities and labyrinths of doing againſt conſcience, I preſume you would not think your ſelf fairly dealt with; but alleage, that your words are not extended to all caſes, but limited <hi>to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of uncertainty.</hi> As little therefore ought you to make this deduction from M. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s words which are apparently alſo reſtrained to <hi>caſes of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</hi> For as for requiring a blind and an unlimited obedience, to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical deciſions univerſally and in all caſes, even when plain Texts or reaſon ſeems to controle them, M. <hi>Hooker</hi> is as far from making ſuch an Idol of Eccleſiaſtical Authority, as the Puritans whom he writes againſt: <hi>I grant</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that proof derived from the authority of mans judgment, is not able to work that aſſurance which doth grow by a ſtronger proof. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore although ten thouſand General Councils would ſet down one and the ſame definitive Sentence, concerning any point of Religion whatſoever; yet one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative Reaſon alleaged, or one manifeſt Teſtimony cited from the Word of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:64345:156"/>God himſelf, to the contrary, could not chuſe, but over-weigh them all: in as much as for them to be deceived, it is not impoſsible; it is, that Demonſtrative Reaſon, or Divine Teſtimony, ſhould deceive.</hi> And again, <hi>Where as it is thought, that, eſpecially with the Church, and thoſe that are called, man's authority ought not to prevail: It muſt and doth prevail even with them, yea with them eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as far as equity requireth, and farther we maintain it not. For men to be tyed and led by authority, as it were with a kind of captivity of judgment; and, though there be reaſon to the contrary, not to liſten to it, but follow like Beaſts, the firſt in the Heard, this were brutiſh.</hi> Again, <hi>That authority of men ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with men either againſt or above reaſon, is no part of our belief. Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of learned men, be they never ſo great and reverend, are to yield unto rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the weight whereof, is no whit prejudic'd by the ſimplicity of his perſon which doth alleage it, but being found to be ſound and good, the bare opinion of men to the contrary, muſt of neceſsity ſtoop &amp; give place.</hi> Thus M <hi>Hooker</hi> in his 7. Sect. Book 2. which place becauſe it is far diſtant from that which is alleaged by you, the overſight of it might be excuſable, did you not impute it to D. <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> as a fault, that he cites ſome clauſes of ſome Books, without reading the whole. But beſides, in that very Sect. out of which you take this corrupted ſentence, he hath very pregnant words to the ſame effect: <hi>as for the orders eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd, ſith equity &amp; reaſon favour that which is in being, till orderly judgment of deciſion be given againſt it, it is but juſtice to exact of you, and perverſneſs in you it ſhould be to deny thereunto your willing obedience. Not that I judg it as a thing allowable, for men to obſerve thoſe Laws, which in their hearts they are ſtedfaſtly perſwaded, to be againſt the Law of God: But your perſwaſion in this caſe, ye are all bound for the time to ſuſpend; and, in otherwiſe doing, ye offend againſt God, by troubling his Church without juſt and neceſſary cauſe. Be it that there are ſome reaſons inducing you to think hardly of our Laws: Are thoſe Reaſons demonſtrative, are they neceſſary, or but meer probabilities on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? An argument neceſſary and demonſtrative is ſuch, as, being propoſed to any man and underſtood, the mind cannot chooſe but inwardly aſſent. Any one ſuch reaſon diſchargeth, I grant, the Conſcience, and ſetteth it at full liberty. For the publique approbation given by the body of this whole Church, unto thoſe things which are eſtabliſhed, doth make it but probable that they are good. And therefore unto a neceſſary proof that they are not good, is muſt give place.</hi> This plain declaration of his judgment in this matter, this expreſs limitation of his former reſolution, he makes in the very ſame Section, which affords your former quotation; and therefore what Apology can be made for you, and your Store-houſe M. <hi>Brerely,</hi> for diſſembling of it, I cannot poſſibly imagine.</p>

But that the Churches intention was only to ſilence diſputes, and to ſettle peace and unity in her government: which becauſe they factiouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, they were juſtly eſteemed Schiſmatiques.

                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6 Thus then we are to proceed: By evidence of manifeſt and incorrupt Tradition, I know that there hath always been a never interrupted Succeſſion of men from the Apoſtles time, believing, profeſſing, and practiſing ſuch and ſuch doctrines: By evident arguments of credibility, as Miracles, Sanctity, Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and, by all thoſe ways whereby the Apoſtles, and our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf confirmed their doctrin, we are aſſured that what the ſaid never-interrupted Church propoſeth, doth deſerve to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and acknowledged as a divine truth: By evidence of Senſe, we ſee that the ſame Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth ſuch and ſuch doctrins as divine truths, that is, as revealed and teſtified by Almighty God. By this divine Teſtimony we are infallibly aſſured of what we believe: and ſo the laſt period, ground, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and <hi>formal object</hi> of our Faith, is, the infallible teſtimony of that ſupreme Verity, which neither can deceive, nor be deceived.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 By this orderly deduction our Faith cometh to be endued with thoſe qualities which we ſaid were requiſite thereto; namely <hi>Certainty, Obſcurity,</hi> and <hi>Prudence. Certainty</hi> proceeds from the <hi>infallible</hi> Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God propounded and conveyed to our underſtanding by ſuch a mean as is infallible in it ſelf, and to us is evidently known that it propoſeth this point or that, and which can manifeſtly declare in what ſenſe it propoſeth them; which means we have proved to be only the viſible Church of Chriſt. <hi>Obſcurity,</hi> from the manner in which God ſpeaks to Mankind, which ordinarily is ſuch, that it doth not manifeilly ſhew the perſon who ſpeaks, nor the truth of the thing ſpoken. <hi>Prudence</hi> is not wanting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our faith is accompanied with ſo many arguments of <hi>Credibility,</hi> that every well diſpoſed <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> may and ought to judge, that the doctrins ſo confirmed deſerve to be believed, as proceeding from divine Authority.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 And thus from what hath been ſaid, we may eaſily gather the particular nature, or definition of <hi>Faith.</hi> For, <hi>it is a voluntary, or free, infallible, obſcure aſſent to ſome truth, becauſe it is teſtified by God, and is ſufficiently propounded to us for ſuch:</hi> which propoſal is ordinarily made by the Viſible Church of Chriſt. I ſay, <hi>Sufficiently propuſed by the Church;</hi> not that I purpoſe to diſpute whether the propoſal of the Church enter into the <hi>formal Object,</hi> or <hi>Motive</hi> of Faith: or whether any error be an hereſie, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally and preciſely,</hi> becauſe it is againſt the propoſition of the Church, as if ſuch propoſal were the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Object of Faith, which D. <hi>Potter,</hi> to no purpoſe at all, labours ſo very hard to diſprove: But I only affirm, that when the Church propounds any Truth, as revealed by God, we are aſſured that it is ſuch indeed; and ſo it inſtantly grows, to be a fit object for Chriſtian faith, which inclines and enables us to believe whatſoever is duly preſented, as a thing revealed by Almighty God. And in the ſame manner we are ſure, that whoſoever oppoſeth any doctrin propoſed by the Church, doth thereby contradict a truth, which is teſtified by God: As when any lawful Superiour notifies his will, by the means, and, as it were, propoſal of ſome faithful meſſenger, the ſubject of ſuch a Superiour in performing, or neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is delivered by the Meſſenger, is ſaid to obey, or diſobey his own lawful Superiour. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe the teſtimony of God is notified by the Church, we may, and we do moſt truly ſay, that not to believe what the Church propoſeth, is, to deny God's holy word or teſtimony ſignified to us by the Church, according to that ſaying of S. <hi>Irenaeus, We need not go</hi>

                        <hi>to any other to ſeck the truth, which we may eaſily receive from the Church.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9 From this definition of faith we may alſo know what <hi>Hereſie</hi> is, by taking the contrary terms, as <hi>Hereſie</hi> is contrary to <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſaying: <hi>Hereſie is a voluntary error againſt that which God hath reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Church hath propoſed for ſuch.</hi> Neither doth it import, whether the error concern points in themſelves great or ſmall, fundamental or not fundamental. For more being required to an act of Vertue, than of Vice, if any truth though never ſo ſmall may be believed by <hi>faith</hi> as ſcon as we know it to be teſtified by divine revelation; much more will it be a formal <hi>Hereſie</hi> to deny any leaſt point ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly propounded as a thing witneſſed by God.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 This divine Faith is divided into <hi>Actual,</hi> and <hi>Habitual. Actual</hi> faith, or faith actuated, is when we are in act of conſideration, and belief of ſome myſterie of Faith; for example, that our Saviour Chriſt, is true God, and Man, <hi>&amp;c. Habitual</hi> faith, is that from which we are denominated <hi>Faithful,</hi> or <hi>Believers,</hi> as by <hi>Actual</hi> faith they are ſtiled <hi>Believing.</hi> This <hi>Habit</hi> of faith is a <hi>Quality</hi> enabling us moſt firmly to believe Objects above humane diſcourſe, and it remaineth permanently in our Soul, even when we are ſleeping, or not thinking of any Myſterie of faith. This is the firſt among the three <hi>Theological</hi> Vertues.

Where I deſire, it be ſtill remembred: That the viſible Catholique Church cannot err damnably, as D. <hi>Potter</hi> confeſſeth. And, that when <hi>Luther</hi> appeared, there was no other viſible true Church of Chriſt diſagreeing from the <hi>Roman,</hi> as we have demonſtrated in the next pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Chapter.</p>
                     <p n="13">13 Now, that <hi>Luther</hi> and his followers cannot be excuſed from formal <hi>Hereſie,</hi> I prove by theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. To oppoſe any truth propounded by the viſible true Church as revealed by God, is formal <hi>Hereſie,</hi> as we have ſhewed out of the deſinition of <hi>Hereſie:</hi> But <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and the reſt did oppoſe divers truths propounded by the viſible Church as revealed by God; yea they did therefore oppoſe her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe propounded, as divine revealed truths, things which they judged either to be falſe, or humane inventions: Therefore they committed formal <hi>Hereſie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14 Moreover, every Errour againſt any doctrin revealed by God, is a damnable Hereſie, whether the matter in it ſelf be great or ſmall, as I proved before: and therefore either the Proteſtants or the <hi>Roman</hi> Church muſt be guilty of formal Hereſie, becauſe one of them muſt err againſt the word and teſtimony of God: but you grant (perforce) that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church doth not err damnably, and I add that ſhe cannot err damnably becauſe ſhe is the truly Catholique Church, which, you confeſs, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err damnably: Therefore Proteſtants muſt be guilty of formal <hi>Hereſie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="15">15 Beſides, we have ſhewed that the viſible Church is Judge of Controverſies, and therefore muſt be infallible in all her Propoſals; which being once ſuppoſed, it manifeſtly followeth, that to oppoſe what ſhe delivereth as revealed by God, is not ſo much to oppoſe <hi>her,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> himſelf; and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be excuſed from grievous Hereſie.</p>
                     <p n="16">16 Again, if <hi>Luther</hi> were an <hi>Heretique,</hi> for thoſe points wherein he diſagreed from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; All they who agree with him in thoſe very points, muſt likewiſe be Heretiques. Now, that <hi>Luther</hi> was a formal Heretique I demonſtrate in this manner. To ſay, that God's viſible true Church is not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, but confined to one only place or corner of the world, is according to your own expreſs words<note n="(q)" place="margin">

Moreover the ſame hereſie follows out of the doctrin of D. <hi>Potter,</hi> and other Proteſtants, that the Church may err in points not fundamental, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have ſhewed that every errour againſt any one revealed truth, is <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and <hi>damnable,</hi> whether the matter be otherwiſe, of it ſelf, great or ſmall. And how can the Church more truly be ſaid to periſh, than when ſhe is permitted to maintain a <hi>damnable Hereſie?</hi> Beſides, we will hereafter prove, that by any act of Hereſie, all divine faith is loſt; and to imagine a true Church of faithful perſons without any faith, is as much as to fancy a living man without life. It is therefore clear, that Donatiſt-like they hold that the Church of Chriſt periſhed: yea they are worſe than the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> who ſaid, that the Church remained at leaſt in <hi>Africa;</hi> whereas Proteſtants muſt of neceſſity be forced to grant, that for a long ſpace before <hi>Luther,</hi> ſhe was no where at all.

For (beſides that there was never Proteſtant Biſhop before <hi>Luther,</hi> and that there can be no continuance of <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> where there was no beginning to ſucceed,) they commonly acknowledge no <hi>Character,</hi> and conſequently muſt affirm that when their pretended Biſhops, or Prieſts are deprived of Juriſdiction, or degraded, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main meer lay perſons as before their Ordination; fulfilling what <hi>Tertullian</hi> objects as a mark of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie: <hi>To day a Prieſt, to morrow</hi>

Neither can they pretend Succeſſion in Authority, or Juriſdiction. For all the Authority, or Juriſdiction, which they had, was conferred by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that is, by the Pope: Becauſe the whole Church col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively doth not meet to ordain Biſhops or Prieſts, or to give them Authority. But, according to their own doctrin, they believe that the Pope neither <hi>hath, or ought to have any Juriſdiction, Power, Superiority, Preheminence, or Authority Eccleſiaſtical, or Spiritual within this Realm,</hi> which they ſwear even when they are ordained Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons: How then can the Pope give Juriſdiction where they ſwear he neither <hi>hath, or OUGHT to have, any?</hi> Or, if yet he had, how could they without <hi>Schiſm</hi> withdraw themſelves from his obedience?

And from whom I pray you, had Biſhops their Authority when there were no Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Kings? Muſt the <hi>Greek</hi> Patriarchs receive ſpiritual Juriſdiction from the <hi>Great Turk?</hi> Did the Pope by the Baptiſm of Princes, loſe the ſpiritual Power he formerly had of conferring ſpiritual Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon Biſhops? Hath the Temporal Magiſtrate authority to preach, to aſſoil from ſins, to inflict Excommunications, and other Cenſures? Why hath he not power to excommunicate, as well as to diſpenſe in Irregularity, as our late Soveraign Lord King <hi>James,</hi> either diſpenſed with the late <hi>Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> or elſe gave commiſſion to ſome Biſhops to do it? And ſince they were ſubject to their Primate, and not he to them, it is clear, that they had no power to diſpenſe with him, but that power muſt proceed from the Prince, as Superiour to them all, and head of the Proteſtants Church in <hi>England.</hi> If he have no ſuch authority, how can he give to others what himſelf hath not? Your Ordination, or Conſecration of Biſhops and Prieſts imprinting no <hi>Character,</hi> can only conſiſt in giving a Power. Authority, Juriſdiction, or (as I ſaid before) ſome kind of Depuration to exerciſe Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, or Prieſtly functions: If then, the Temporal Magiſtrate conferrs this power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he can, nay he cannot chuſe but, Ordain and Conſecrate Biſhops, and Prieſts, as often as he conferrs Authority or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction: and your Biſhops aſſoon as they are deſigned and confirmed by the King, muſt <hi>ipſo facto</hi> be Ordained and Conſecrated by him without intervention of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> or <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Ordination:</hi> Which abſurdities you will be more unwilling to grant, than well able to avoid, if you will be true to your own doctrins. The Pope from whom originally you muſt beg your Succeſſion of Biſhops, never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, nor will, nor can acknowledge to receive any Spiritual Juriſdiction from any Temporal Prince, and therefore if Juriſdiction muſt be derived from Princes, he hath none at all: and yet either you muſt acknowledge, that he hath true Spiritual Juriſdiction, or that your ſelves can receive none from him.</p>

Every Proteſtant, as I ſuppoſe, is perſwaded that his own opinions be true, and that he hath uſed ſuch means as are wont to be preſcribed for underſtanding the Scripture, as Prayer, Conferring of divers Texts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet their diſagreements ſhew that ſome of them are deceived: And therefore it is clear that they have no one certain ground whereon to relie for underſtanding of Scripture. And ſeeing they hold all the Articles of Faith, even concerning fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental points, upon the ſelf ſame ground of Scripture, interpreted, not by the Churches Authority, according to ſome other Rules, which, as experience of their contradictions teach, do ſometimes fail; it is clear that the ground of their faith is infallible in no point at all. And albeit ſometime it chance to hit on the truth, yet it is likewiſe apt to lead them to error: As all Arch-heretiques believing ſome truths, and withall divers errors upon the ſame ground and motive, have indeed no true divine infallible faith, but only a fallible humane opinion, and perſwaſion. For if the ground upon which they rely were certain, it could never produce any errour.</p>
                     <p n="29">29 Another cauſe of uncertainty in the faith of Proteſtants, muſt riſe from their diſtinction of points fundamental, and not fundamental. For ſince they acknowledge, that every error in fundamental points deſtroyeth the ſubſtance of faith, and yet cannot determine what points be fundamental, it followeth that they muſt remain uncertain whether or no they be not in ſome fundamental error, and ſo want the ſubſtance of faith, without which there can be no hope of Salvation.</p>

But the formal object of ſaith is the ſupreme Truth as it is manifeſied in Scriptures, and in the doctrin of the Church which proceed from the ſame ſupreme Verity. Whoſoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth not relie upon the doctrin of the Church (which proceeds from the ſupreme Verity, manifeſted in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) as upon an infallible Rule, he hath not the habit of faith, but believes thoſe things which belong to

Now it is manifeſt, that he who relies on the doctrin of the Church, as upon an infallible Rule, will yield his aſſent to all, that the Church teacheth. For, if among thoſe things which ſhe teacheth, he hold what he will, and doth not hold what he will not, he doth not relie upon the doctrin of the Church, as upon an infallible Rule, but only upon his own will. And ſo it is clear, that an Heretique, who with pertinacity denieth one Article of ſaith, is not ready to follow the doctrin of the Church in all things: And therefore it is manifeſt, that whoſoever is an Heretique in any one Article of faith, concerning other Articles, hath not faith, but a kind of Opinion, or his own Will.</hi> Thus far S. <hi>Thomas.</hi> And afterward: <hi>A man doth believe</hi>

2 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 2, 3. Firſt for your grounds; a great part of them, is falſely ſaid to be either proved or granted. It is true indeed, that <hi>Man by his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural wit or induſtry could never have attained to the knowledge of Gods will to give him a ſupernatural and eternal happineſs;</hi> nor of the means, by which his pleaſure was to beſtow this happineſs upon him. And therefore your firſt ground is good, <hi>That is was requiſite his underſtanding ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to apprehend that end and means, by a knowledge ſupernatural.</hi> I ſay this is good, if you mean by <hi>knowledge,</hi> an apprehenſion or belief. But, if you take the word properly and exactly, it is both falſe; for faith is not knowledge, no more than three is four, but eminently contained in it: ſo that he that knows, believes and ſomething more; but he that believes, many times does not know; nay, if he doth barely and meerly believe he doth never know: and beſides, it is retracted by your ſelf preſently, where you require, <hi>That the object of faith muſt be both naturally and ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally unknown.</hi> And again in the next page, where you ſay, <hi>Faith differs from ſcience in regard of the object's obſcurity.</hi> For that ſcience and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge properly taken are Synonymous terms, and that a knowledge of a thing abſolutely unknown is a plain implicancy; I think, are things ſo plain, that you will not require any proof of them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 But then whereas you adde, <hi>that, if ſuch a knowledge were no more than probable, it could not be able ſufficiently to overbear our will, and encounter with humane probabilities, being backed with the ſtrength of fleſh and blood, and therefore conclude, that it was farther neceſſary, that this ſupernatural knowledge ſhould be moſt certain and infallible:</hi> To this I anſwer, that I do heartily acknowledg and believe, the Articles of our faith be in themſelves Truths, as certain and infallible as the very common Principles of Geometry and Metaphyſicks. But that there is required of us a knowledge of them, and an adherence to them, as certain as that offenſe or ſcience; that ſuch a certainty is required of us under pain of damnation, ſo that no man can hope to be in the ſtate of ſalvation, but he that finds in himſelf ſuch a degree of faith, ſuch a ſtrength of adherence: This I have already demonſtrated to be a great error, and of dangerous and pernitious conſequence. And becauſe I am more and more confirm'd in my perſwaſion that the truth which I there delivered, is of great and ſingular uſe, I will here confirm it with more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And to ſatisfie you that this is no ſingularity of my own, my Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent preſents you with a<note n="(a)" place="margin">M. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his anſwer to <hi>Travers</hi> his Supplication; I have taught, that the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of things which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve by the word, is not ſo certain as of that we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by ſenſe. And is it as certain? Yea I taught, that the things which God doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in his world are ſurer unto us than any thing we touch, handle, or ſee. But are we ſo ſure and certain of them? If we be, why doth God ſo often prove his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes unto us, as he doth, by arguments taken from our ſenſible expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience? We muſt be ſurer of the proof than the thing proved, otherwiſe it is no proof. How is it that if ten men do all look upon the Moon, every one of them knows it as certainly to be the Moon as another: but many believing one and the ſame promiſes, all have not one and the ſame fulneſs of perſwaſion? How falleth it our, that men being aſſured of any thing by ſenſe can be no ſurer of it than they are? whereas the ſtrongeſt in faith that liveth upon the earth, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes need to labour, and ſtrive, and pray, that his aſſurance concerning heavenly and ſpiritual things may grow, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and be augmented.</note> Proteſtant Divine of great authority, and no way ſingular in his opinions, who hath long ſince preached and juſtified the ſame doctrin.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 I ſay, that every Text of Scripture which makes mention of any that were <hi>weak,</hi> or of any that were <hi>ſtrong in faith:</hi> of any that were <hi>of little,</hi> or any that were <hi>of great faith:</hi> of any that <hi>abounded,</hi> or any that were <hi>rich</hi> in faith; of <hi>encreaſing, growing, rooting grounding, eſtabliſhing, confirming in faith:</hi> Every ſuch Text, is a demonſtrative refutation of this vain fancy: proving that faith, even true and ſaving faith, is not a thing conſiſting in ſuch
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:64345:162"/>an indiviſible point of perfection as you make it, but capable of augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diminution. Every prayer you make to God to increaſe your faith, or (if you conceive ſuch a prayer derogatory from the perfection of your faith,) the Apoſtles praying to Chriſt <hi>to increaſe their faith,</hi> is a convincing argument of the ſame concluſion. Moreover, if this doctrin of yours were true, then, ſeeing not any the leaſt doubting can conſiſt with a moſt infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible certainty, it will follow that every leaſt doubting in any matter of faith, though reſiſted and involuntary, is a damnable ſin, abſolutely deſtructive, ſo long as it laſts, of all true and ſaving faith: which you are ſo far from grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that you make it no ſin at all, but only an occaſion of merit: and if you ſhould eſteem it a ſin, then muſt you acknowledge, contrary to your own Principles, that there are Actual ſins meerly involuntary. The ſame is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore invincibly confirmed by every deliberate ſin that any Chriſtian commits; by any progreſs in Charity that he makes. For ſeeing, as S. <hi>John</hi> aſſures us, <hi>our faith is the victory which overcomes the world,</hi> certainly if the faith of all true Believers were perfect, (and, if true faith be capable of no imperfection, if all faith be a knowledge moſt certain and infallible, all faith muſt be perfect; for the moſt imperfect that is, according to your doctrin, if it be true, muſt be <hi>moſt certain;</hi> and ſure the moſt perfect that is cannot be more than moſt certain,) then certainly their victory over the world, and therefore over the fleſh, and therefore over ſin, muſt of neceſsity be perfect, and ſo it ſhould be impoſsible for any true believer to commit any delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſin, and therefore he that commits any ſin, muſt not think himſelf a true believer. Beſides, ſeeing faith worketh by Charity, and Charity is the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of faith: certainly if the cauſe were perfect, the effect would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and conſequently as you make no degrees in Faith, ſo there would be none in Charity, and ſo no man could poſſibly make any progreſs in it, but all crue believers ſhould be equal in Charity, as in faith you make them equal: and from thence it would follow unavoidably, that whoſoever finds in himſelf any true faith, muſt preſently perſwade himſelf that he is perfect in Charity: and whoſoever, on the other ſide, diſcovers in his charity any imperfection muſt not believe that he hath any true faith. Theſe, you ſee, are ſtrange and portentous conſequences, and yet the deduction of them from your doctrin is clear and apparent; which ſhews this doctrin of yours, which you would fain have true, that there might be ſome neceſsity of your Churches infallibility, to be indeed plainly repugnant not only to Truth but even to all Religion and Piety, and fit for nothing but to make men negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of making any progreſs in Faith or Charity. And therefore I muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat and adjure you either to diſcover unto me (which I take God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I cannot perceive,) ſome fallacy in my reaſons againſt it, or never hereafter to open your mouth in defence of it.</p>
                        <p n="5">5 As for that one ſingle reaſon which you produce to confirm it, it will appear upon examination to be reſolved finally into a groundleſs. Aſſertion of your own, contrary to all Truth and experience, and that is, <hi>That no degree of faith, leſs than a moſt certain and infallible knowledge, can be able ſufficiently to overbear our will, and encounter with humane probabilities, being backt with the ſtrength of Fleſh and Blood.</hi> For who ſees not that many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions in the world forgo many times their preſent eaſe and pleaſure, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go great and toilſom labours, encounter great difficulties, adventure upon great dangers, and all this not upon any certain expectation, but upon a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:64345:163"/>hope of ſome future gain and commodity, and that not infinite and eternal, but finite and temporal? Who ſees not that many men abſtain from many things they exceedingly deſire, not upon any certain aſſurance, but a probable fear of danger that may come after? What man ever was there ſo madly in love with a preſent penny, but that he would willingly ſpend it upon any little hope that by doing ſo he might gain an hundred thouſand pound? And I would fain know, <hi>what gay probabilities</hi> you could deviſe to diſſwade him from this Reſolution. And, if you can deviſe none, what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then, or ſenſe is there, but that a probable hope of infinite and eternal happineſs, provided for all thoſe that obey <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> &amp; much more a firm faith, though not ſo certain, in ſome ſort, as ſenſe or ſcience, may be able to ſway our will to obedience, and encounter with all thoſe temptations which Fleſh and Blood can ſuggeſt to avert us from it? Men may talk their pleaſure of an abſolute and moſt infallible certainty, but did they generall believe that obedience to Chriſt were the only way to preſent and eternal felicity, but as firmly and undoubtedly as that there is ſuch a City as <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> nay but as much as <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Commentaries, or the Hiſtory of <hi>Saluſt;</hi> I believe the lives of moſt men, both Papiſts and Proteſtants would be better than they are. Thus therefore out of your own words I argue againſt you: He that requires to true faith, an abſolute and infallible certainty, for this only Reaſon <hi>becauſe any leſs degree, could not be able to overbear our will,</hi> &amp;c. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that if a leſs degree of faith were able to do this, then a leſs degree of faith may be true and divine and ſaving Faith: But, experience ſhews, and reaſon confirms, that a firm faith, though not ſo certain as ſenſe or ſcience, may be able to encounter and overcome our will and affections: And therefore it follows from your own reaſon, that faith, which is not a moſt certain and infallible knowledge, may be true and divine and ſaving faith.</p>
                        <p n="6">6 All theſe Reaſons I have imployed to ſhew that ſuch a moſt certain and infallible faith as here you talk of, is not ſo neceſſary, but that without ſuch a high degree of it, it is poſſible to pleaſe God. And therefore the Doctrins delivered by you §. 26 are moſt preſumptuous and uncharitable: <hi>viz. That ſuch a moſt certain and infallible faith is neceſſary to ſalvation, Neceſsitate Finis, or Medii;</hi> ſo neceſſary, that <hi>after a man is come to the uſe of reaſon, no man ever was or can be ſaved without it.</hi> Wherein you boldly intrude into the judgment-feat of God, and damn men for breaking Laws, not of God's but your own making. But withall, you clearly contradict yourſelf, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where you affirm, <hi>That your faith depends finally upon the Tradition of Age to Age, of Father to Son,</hi> which cannot be a fit ground, but only for a Moral Aſſurance; nor only, where you pretend, that <hi>not alone Hearing and Seeing,</hi> but alſo <hi>Hiſtories, Letters, Relations of many</hi> (which certainly are things not certain and infallible,) <hi>are yet foundations good enough to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port your faith;</hi> Which Doctrin, if it were good and allowable, Proteſtants might then hope that their Hiſtories, and Letters, and Relations might alſo paſs for means ſufficient of a ſufficient Certainty, &amp; that they ſhould not be excluded from Salvation for want of ſuch a Certainty. But indeed the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the preſent difficulty compell'd you to ſpeak here, what I believe you will not juſtifie, &amp; with a pretty tergiverſation to ſhew D. <hi>Potter</hi> your means of moral certainty; whereas the Objection was, that you had no means or poſſibility of infallible certainty, for which you are plainly at as great a loſs, and as far to ſeek, as any of your Adverſaries. And therefore it
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:64345:163"/>concerns you highly not to damn others for want of it, leſt you involve your ſelves in the ſame condemnation; according to thoſe terrible words of S. <hi>Paul, Thou art inexcuſable, O Man, whoſoever thou art that judgeſt: For, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thou judgeſt another, thou condemneſt thy ſelf; for thou that judgeſt doſt the ſame things,</hi> &amp;c. In this therefore you plainly contradict your ſelf. And laſtly moſt plainly, in ſaying as you do here, you contradict and retract your pretence of Charity to Proteſtants in the beginning of your Book: For there you make profeſſion, that <hi>you have no aſſurance but that Proteſtants dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Proteſtants, may poſsibly die with contrition, and be ſaved:</hi> And here you are very peremptory, that <hi>they cannot but want a means abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, and wanting that cannot but be damned.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">The third Condition you require to faith, is, that our aſſent to divine Truths ſhould <hi>not only be unknown and unevident by any humane diſcourſe,</hi> but that <hi>abſolutely alſo it ſhould be obſcure in it ſelf, and, ordinarily ſpeaking, be void even of ſupernatural evidence.</hi> Which words muſt have a very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable conſtruction, or elſe they will not be ſenſe. For who can make any thing of theſe words taken properly, that <hi>faith muſt be an unknown unevident aſſent or an aſſent abſolutely obſcure?</hi> I had always thought, that known and unknown, obſcure and evident had been affections, not of our Aſſent, but the Object of it, not of our belief, but the thing believed. For well may we aſſent to a thing unknown, obſcure, or unevident; but that our aſſent it ſelf ſhould be called therefore unknown or obſcure, ſeems to me as great an impropriety, as if I ſhould ſay, Your ſight were green or blew, becauſe you ſee ſomething that is ſo. In other places, therefore, I anſwer your words, but here I muſt anſwer your meaning: which I conceive to be, That it is neceſſary to faith that the Objects of it, the points which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, ſhould not be ſo evidently certain, as to neceſſitate our underſtanding to an Aſſent, that ſo there might be ſome merit in faith, as you love to ſpeak (who will not receive no not from God himſelf, but a penny-worth for a penny,) but, as we, ſome obedience in it, which can hardly have place where there is no poſſibility of diſobedience; as there is not, where the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding does all, and the will nothing. Now ſeeing the Religion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, thought it be much more credible than yours, yet is not pretended to have the abſolute evidence of ſenſe or demonſtration; therefore I might let this doctrin paſs without exception, for any prejudice that can redound to us by it. But yet I muſt not forbear to tell you; that your diſcourſe proves indeed this condition requiſite to the merit, but yet not to the eſſence of faith: without it faith were not an act of obedience, but yet faith may be faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; and this you muſt confeſs, unleſs you will ſay either the Apoſtles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not the whole Goſpel which they preached, or that they were not cy-witneſſes of a great part of it: unleſs you will queſtion S. <hi>John</hi> for ſaying <hi>that which we have ſeen with our eys, &amp; which our hands have handled,</hi> &amp;c <hi>declare we unto you:</hi> nay our Saviour himſelf for ſaying, <hi>Thomas becauſe thou ſeeſt, thou believeſt, Bleſſed are they which have not ſeen &amp; yet have believed.</hi> Yet, if you will ſay that in reſpect of the things which they ſaw, the Apoſtles aſſent was not pure and proper and meer faith, but ſomewhat more; an aſſent contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith but ſuperadding to it, I will not contend with you; for it will be a contention about words. But then again I muſt crave leave to tell you, that the requiring this condition, is in my judgment a plain revocation of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. For had you made the matter of faith either naturally or ſupernaturally
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:64345:164"/>evident, it might have been a fitly attempered and duly proportioned ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for an abſolute certainty natural or ſupernatural: But requiring as you do, <hi>that faith ſhould be an abſolute knowledge of a thing not abſolutely known, an infallible certainty of a thing, which, though it be in it ſelf, yet it is not made appear to us to be, infallibly certain,</hi> to my underſtanding you ſpeak impoſsibilities. And truly for one of your Religion to do ſo, is but a good <hi>Decorum.</hi> For the matter and object of your Faith being ſo full of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, a contradictions faith may very well become a contradictious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Your faith therefore, if you pleaſe to have it ſo, let it be a free neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated, certain uncertain, evident obſcure, prudent and fooliſh, natural and ſupernatural unnatural aſſent. But they which are unwilling to believe non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe themſelves, or to perſwade others to do ſo, it is but reaſon they ſhould make the faith wherewith they believe, an intelligible, compoſsible, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent thing, &amp; not define it by repugnancies. Now nothing is more repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, than that a man ſhould be required to give moſt certain credit unto that which cannot be made appear moſt certainly credible: and, if it appear to him to be ſo, then is it not obſcure that it is ſo. For, if you ſpeak of an acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, rational, diſcurſive faith, certainly theſe Reaſons which make the object ſeem credible, muſt be the cauſe of it, and conſequently the ſtrength and fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of my aſſent muſt riſe and fall, together with the apparent credibility of the object. If you ſpeak of a ſupernatural infuſed faith, then you either ſuppoſe it infuſed by the former means, and then that which was ſaid before muſt be ſaid again: for whatſoever effect is wrought meerly by means, muſt bear proportion to, and cannot exceed the vertue of the means, by which it is wrought: As nothing by water can be made more cold than water, nor by fire more hot than fire, nor by honey more ſweet than honey, nor by gall more bitter than gall: Or, if you will ſuppoſe it infuſed without means, then that power which infuſeth into the underſtanding aſſent which bears Analogy to ſight in the eye, muſt alſo infuſe Evidence, that is, Viſibility into the Object: and look what degree of aſſent is infus'd into the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, at leaſt the ſame degree of evidence muſt be infuſed into the Object. And for you to require a ſtrength of credit beyond the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the object's credibility, is all one as if you ſhould require me to go ten miles an hour upon an horſe that will go but five: to diſcern a man certainly through a myſt or cloud that makes him not certainly diſcernable; to hear and ſound more clearly than it is audible; to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a thing more fully than it is intelligible: and he that doth ſo, I may well expect that his next injunction will be, that I muſt ſee ſomething that is inviſible, hear ſomething inaudible, underſtand ſomething that is wholly unintelligible. For he that demands ten of me, knowing I have but five, does in effect, as if he demanded five, knowing that I have none: and by like reaſon, you requiring that I ſhould ſee things farther then they are viſible, require I ſhould ſee ſomething inviſible; and in requiring that I believe ſomething more firmly than it is made to me evidently credible, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in effect that I believe ſome thing which appears to me incredible, and while it does ſo. I deny not but that I am bound to believe the truth of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Texts of Scripture, the ſenſe whereof is to me obſcure; and the truth of many Articles of faith, the manner whereof is obſcure, and to humane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings incomprehenſible; But then it is to be obſerved, that not the ſenſe of ſuch Texts, not the manner of theſe things is that which I am bound
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:64345:164"/>to believe, but the truth of them. But that I ſhould believe the truth of any thing, the truth whereof cannot be made evident with an evidence propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the degree of faith required of me, this I ſay for any man to be bound to, is unjuſt and unreaſonable, becauſe to do it is impoſſible.</p>
                        <p n="8">8 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.9, 10, 11, <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. Yet though I deny that it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us to be certain in the higheſt degree, infallibly certain of the truth of the things which we believe (for this were to know and not believe, neither is it poſſible unleſs our evidence of it, be it natural or ſupernatural, were of the higheſt degree;) yet I deny not, but we ought to be and may be infallibly certain that we are to believe the Religion of Chriſt. For firſt, this is moſt certain, that we are in all things to do according to wiſdom and reaſon, rather than againſt it. Secondly this is as certain, That wiſdom and Reaſon require, that we ſhould believe thoſe things which are by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees more credible and probable than the contrary. Thirdly, this is as certain, that to every man who conſiders impartially what great things may be ſaid for the truth of Chriſtianity, and what poor things they are which may be ſaid againſt it, either for any other Religion or for none at all, it cannot but appear by many degrees more credible, that Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is true, than the contrary. And from all theſe premiſſes, this concluſion evidently follows that it is infallibly certain, that we are firmly to believe the truth of Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                        <p n="9">9 Your diſcourſe therefore touching the fourth requiſite to faith which is Prudence, I admit ſo far as to grant. 1. That if we were required to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve with certainty (I mean a Moral certainty,) things no way repreſented as infallible and certain (I mean morally,) an unreaſonable obedience were required of us. And ſo likewiſe were it, were we required to believe as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely certain, that which is no way repreſented to us as abſolutely cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. 2. That whom God obligeth to believe any thing, he will not fail to furniſh their underſtandings with ſuch inducements, as are ſufficient (if they be not negligent or perverſe) to perſwade them to believe. 3. That there is an abundance of Arguments exceedingly credible, inducing men to believe the Truth of Chriſtianity: I ſay ſo credible, that though they cannot make us evidently ſee what we believe, yet they evidently convince that in true wiſdom and prudence, the Articles of it deſerve credit, and ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as things revealed by God. 4. That without ſuch reaſons and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, our choice even of the true faith, is not to be commended as prudent, but to be condemned of raſhneſs and levity.</p>
                        <p n="10">10 But then for your making Prudence, not only a commendation of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and a juſtification of his faith, but alſo eſſential to it, and part of the definition of it, in that queſtionleſs you were miſtaken, and have done as if being to ſay what a man is, you ſhould define him, A Reaſonable creature that hath skill in Aſtronomy. For as all Aſtronomers are men, but all men are not Aſtronomers, and therefore Aſtronomy ought not to be put into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Men, where nothing ſhould have place, but what agrees to all men: So though all that are truly wiſe (that is, wiſe for eternity,) will believe aright, yet many may believe aright which are not wiſe. I could wiſh with all my heart, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, <hi>that all the Lords people could Propheſie:</hi> That all that believe the true Religion <hi>were able</hi> (according to S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s injunction) <hi>to give a reaſon of the hope that is in them,</hi> a reaſon why they hope for eternal happineſs by this way rather than any other! neither do I think it any great
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:64345:165"/>difficulty that men of ordinary capacities, if they would give their mind to it, might quickly be enabled to do ſo. But ſhould I affirm that all true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers can do ſo, I ſuppoſe it would be as much againſt experience and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, as it is againſt Truth and Charity, to ſay as you do, that <hi>they which cannot do ſo, either are not at all, or to no purpoſe true believers.</hi> And thus we ſee that the foundations you build upon, are ruinous and deceitful, and ſo unfit to ſupport your Fabrick that they deſtroy one another. I come now to ſhew that your Arguments to prove Proteſtants Heretiques, are all of the ſame quality with your former grounds: which I will do, by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing clear and ſatisfying Anſwers in order to them.</p>
                        <p n="11">11 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 13. To the firſt then, delivered by you §. 13. <hi>That Proteſtants muſt be Heretiques, becauſe they oppoſed divers Truths propounded for divine by the Viſible Church:</hi> I anſwer, It is not hereſie to oppoſe any truth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the Church, but only ſuch a Truth as is an eſſential part of the Goſpel of Chriſt. 2. The Doctrins which Proteſtants oppoſed, were not Truths, but plain and impious falſhoods: Neither, thirdly, were they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded as Truths by the Viſible Church, but only by a Part of it, and that a corrupted Part.</p>
                        <p n="12">12 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 14. The next <hi>Argument, in the next Particle tell us,</hi> That every <hi>error againſt any doctrin revealed by God is damnable Hereſie: Now either Proteſtants or the Roman Church muſt err againſt the word of God: But the Roman Church</hi> we <hi>grant (perforce) doth not err damnably, neither can ſhe, becauſe ſhe is the Catholique Church, which</hi> we (you ſay) <hi>confeſs cannot err damnably: Therefore Proteſtants muſt err againſt God's word, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are guilty of formal Hereſie.</hi> Whereunto I anſwer plainly, that there be in this argument almoſt as many falſhoods as aſſertions. For neither is every error againſt any Doctrin revealed by God a damnable Hereſie, unleſs it be revealed publiquely and plainly with a command that a I ſhould believe it. 2. D. <hi>Potter</hi> no where grants, that the Errors of the Roman Church are <hi>not in themſelves damnable,</hi> though he hopes by accident they may not actually damn ſome men amongſt you: and this you your ſelf confeſs in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places of your Book, where you tell us, that he <hi>allows no hope of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to thoſe amongſt you, whom ignorance cannot exouſe.</hi> 3. You beg the Queſtion twice in taking for granted, Firſt, That <hi>the Roman Church is the truly Catholique Church,</hi> which without much favour can hardly paſs for a part of it. And again, that the <hi>Catholique Church cannot fall into any error of it ſelf damnable;</hi> for it may do ſo, and ſtill be the Catholique Church, if it retain thoſe Truths which may be an antidote againſt the malignity of this error, to thoſe that held it out of a ſimple un-affected ignorance. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though the thing be true, yet I might well require ſome proof of it from you, that either Proteſtants or the Roman Church muſt err againſt God's word. For, if their contradiction be your only reaſon, then alſo you or the <hi>Dominicans</hi> muſt be Heretiques, becauſe you contradict one another as much as Proteſtants and Papiſts.</p>
                        <p n="13">13 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 15. The third Argument, pretends that <hi>you have ſhewed already, that the Viſible Church is Judge of Controverſies, and therefore infallible, from whence you ſuppoſe that it follows, that to oppoſe her, is to oppoſe God.</hi> To which I anſwer, that you have ſaid only, and not ſhewed, that <hi>the, Viſible Church is Judg of Controverſies.</hi> And indeed how can ſhe be Judge of them if ſhe cannot decide them? And how can ſhe decide them, if it be a queſtion
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:64345:165"/>Whether ſhe be judge of them? That which is queſtion'd it ſelf cannot with any ſenſe be pretended to be fit to decide other queſtions; and much leſs this queſtion, Whether it have Authority to judge and decide all queſtions? 2. If ſhe were Judge, it would not follow that ſhe were infallible; for we have many Judges in our Courts of Judicature, yet none infallible. Nay, you cannot with any modeſty deny, that every man in the world ought to judge for himſelf, what Religion is trueſt; and yet you will not ſay that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is infallible. 3. If the Church were ſuppoſed infallible, yet it would not follow at all, much leſs manifeſtly, that to oppoſe her Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to oppoſe God: unleſs you ſuppoſe alſo that as ſhe is infallible, ſo by her oppoſers, ſhe is known or believed to be ſo. Laſtly, If all this were true (as it is all moſt falſe) yet were it to little purpoſe, ſeeing you have omitted to prove that the Viſible Church is the <hi>Roman.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="14">14 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 16. Inſtead of a fourth Argument this is preſented to us, <hi>That, if</hi> Luther <hi>were an Heretique, then they that agreed with him muſt be ſo.</hi> And that <hi>Luther</hi> was a formal Heretique, you endeavour to prove by this moſt formal Syllogiſm; <hi>To ſay the Viſible Church is not Univerſal, is properly an Hereſie: But</hi> Luther<hi>'s Reformation was not Univerſal: Therefore it cannot be excuſed from formal Hereſie.</hi> Whereunto I Anſwer, firſt to the firſt part, that it is no way impoſſible that <hi>Luther,</hi> had he been the inventor and firſt broacher of a falſe Doctrin, (as he was not) might have been a formal He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique, and yet that thoſe who follow him may be only ſo materially and improperly, and indeed no Heretiques. Your own men out of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> diſtinguiſh between <hi>Haeretici &amp; Haereticorum ſequaces:</hi> And you your ſelf though you pronounce <hi>the leaders among the</hi> Arrians <hi>formal Heretiques,</hi> yet confeſs that <hi>Salvian</hi> was at leaſt doubtful whether thoſe Arrians, who in ſimplicity followed their Teachers, might not be excuſed by ignorance. And about this ſuſpenſion of his you alſo ſeem ſuſpended; for you neither approve nor condemn it. Secondly, to the ſecond part, I ſay, that, had you not preſumed upon our ignorance in Logick as well as Metaphyſicks and School-Divinity, you would never have obtruded upon us this rope of ſand for a formal Syllogiſm. It is even Conſen-German to this, To deny the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is properly an Hereſie, But <hi>Luther</hi>'s Reformation was not Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, Therefore it cannot be excuſed from formal Hereſie! Or to this, To ſay the Viſible Church is not Univerſal is properly an Hereſie: But the preaching of the Goſpel at the beginning was not Univerſal: Therefore it cannot be excuſed from formal Hereſie. For as he whoſe Reformation is but particular, may yet not deny the Reſurrection, ſo many he alſo not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Churches Univerſality. And as the Apoſtles who preached the Goſpel in the beginning, did believe the Church Univerſal, though their preaching at the beginning was not ſo: So <hi>Luther</hi> alſo might and did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Church Univerſal, though his Reformation were but particular. I ſay, he did believe it Univerſal, even in your own ſenſe, that is, Univerſal <hi>de jure,</hi> though not <hi>de facto.</hi> And as for Univerſality in fact, he believed the Church much more Univerſal than his Reformation: For he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive (as appears by your own Allegations out of him) that not only the Part reformed was the true Church, but alſo that they were Part of it who needed Reformation. Neither did he ever pretend to make a new Church but to reform the old one. Thirdly and laſtly, to the firſt propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this unſyllogiſtical ſyllogiſm, I anſwer, That to ſay the true Church
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:64345:166"/>is not always <hi>de facto</hi> univerſal, is ſo far from being an Hereſie, that it is a certain truth known to all thoſe that know the world, and what Religions poſſeſs far the greater part of it. <hi>Donatus</hi> therefore was not to blame, for ſaying, that the Church might poſſibly be confin'd to <hi>Africk;</hi> but for ſaying without ground, that then it was ſo. And S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> as he was in the right, in thinking that the Church was then extended farther than <hi>Africk;</hi> ſo was he in the wrong, if he thought that of neceſſity it alwayes muſt be ſo; but moſt palpably miſtaken in conceiving that it was then ſpread over the whole earth, and known to all nations; which, if paſſion did not trouble you, and make you forget how lately almoſt half the world was diſcovered, and in what eſtate it was then found, you would very eaſily ſee and confeſs.</p>
                        <p n="15">15 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 17. In the next Section you pretend <hi>that you have no deſire to proſecute the ſimilitude of Proteſtants with the Donatiſts;</hi> and yet you do it with as much ſpight and malice as could well be deviſed, but in vain: For <hi>Lucilla</hi> might do ill in promoting the Sect of the Donatiſts, and yet the mother and the daughter, whom you glance at, might do well in <hi>miniſtring influence</hi> (as you phraſe it) <hi>to Proteſtants in England.</hi> Unleſs you will conclude, becauſe one woman did one thing ill, therefore no woman can do any thing well: or becauſe it was ill done to promote one Sect, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be ill done, to maintain any.</p>
                        <p n="16">16 The <hi>Donatiſts might do ill in calling the Chair of</hi> Rome <hi>the Chair of Peſtilence, and the Roman Church an Harlot;</hi> and yet, the ſtate of the Church being altered, Proteſtants might do well to do ſo: and therefore though S. <hi>Auſtin might perhaps have reaſon to perſecute the Donatiſts for detracting from the Church,</hi> and calling her harlot, when ſhe was not ſo; yet you may have none to threaten D. <hi>Potter</hi> that you would perſecute him (as the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this place intimates you would,) if it were in your power: plainly ſhewing that you are a curſt Cow though your horns be ſhort, ſeeing the Roman Church is not now what it was in S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time. And hereof the concluſion of your own book affords us a very pregnant teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: where you tell us out of Saint <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that one grand impediment, which among many kept the ſeduced followers of the faction of <hi>Donatus</hi> from the Churches Communion, was, a calumny raiſed againſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, That <hi>they did ſet ſome ſtrange thing upon their Altar. To how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>) <hi>did the reports of ill tongues ſhut up the way to enter, who ſaid, that we put I know not what upon the Altar?</hi> Out of deteſtation of the calumny, and juſt indignation againſt it, he would not ſo much as name the impiety wherewith they were charged, and therefore by a Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical figure calls it, <hi>I know not what.</hi> But compare with him <hi>Optatus,</hi> writing of the ſame matter, and you ſhall plainly perceive that this <hi>(I know not what)</hi> pretended to be ſet upon the Altar, was indeed a Picture, which the Donatiſts (knowing how deteſtable a thing it was to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans at that time, to ſet up any Pictures in a Church to worſhip them, as your new faſhion is) bruited abroad to be done in the Churches of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church. But what anſwer doth S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Optatus</hi> make to this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation? Do they confeſs and maintain it? Do they ſay, as you would now, It is true we do ſet Pictures upon our Altar, and that not only for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament or memory, but for worſhip alſo; but we do well to do ſo, and this ought not to trouble you, or affright you from our Communion? What other anſwer your Church, could now make to ſuch an objection, is
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:64345:166"/>very hard to imagine: And therefore were your Doctrin the ſame with the Doctrin of the Fathers in this point, they muſt have anſwered ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. But they to the contrary not only deny the crime, but abhorr and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it. To little purpoſe therefore do you hunt after theſe poor ſhadows of reſemblances between us and the <hi>Donatiſts:</hi> unleſs you could ſhew an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act reſemblance between the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the ancient: which ſeeing by this, and many other particulars, it is demonſtrated to be impoſſible; that Church which was then a Virgin may be now a Harlot, and that which was detraction in the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> may be in Proteſtants a juſt accuſation.</p>
                        <p n="17">17 As ill ſucceſs have you in comparing D. <hi>Potter</hi> with <hi>Tyconius</hi> whom as S. <hi>Auſtin finds fault with for continuing in the Donatiſts ſeparation, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forſaken the ground of it, the Doctrin of the Churches periſhing: ſo you condemn the Doctor, for continuing in their communion, who hold</hi> (as you ſay) <hi>the very ſame Hereſie.</hi> But if this were indeed the Doctrin of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts,</hi> how is it that you ſay preſently after; <hi>that the Proteſtants who hold the Church of Chriſt periſhed, were worſe than Donatiſts, who ſaid that the Church remained at leaſt in</hi> Africa? Theſe things me-thinks hang not well together. But to let this paſs; The truth is, this difference, for which you would fain raiſe ſuch a horrible diſſention between D. <hi>Potter</hi> and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, if it be well conſidered is only in words and the manner of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: They affirming only, that the Church periſhed from its integrity, and fell into many corruptions which he denies not: And the Doctor denying only that it fell from its eſſence, and became no Church at all, which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm not.</p>
                        <p n="18">18 Theſe therefore are but velitations, and you would ſeem to make but ſmall account of them. But the main point you ſay is, that <hi>ſince</hi> Luther<hi>'s Reformed Church was not in being for divers Centuries before</hi> Luther, <hi>and yet was in the Apoſtles time, they muſt of neceſsity affirm heretically with the Donatiſts, that the true unſpotted Church of Chriſt periſhed, and that ſhe which remained on earth, was (O Blaſphemy!) an Harlot.</hi> By which words it ſeems you are reſolute perpetually to confound <hi>True</hi> and <hi>Unſpotted;</hi> and to put no difference between a corrupted Church and none at all. But what is this, but to make no difference between a diſeaſed and a dead man? Nay what is it but to contradict your ſelves, who cannot deny but that ſins are as great ſtains and ſpots and deformities in the ſight of God, as errours; and confeſs your Church to be a congregation of men, whereof every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, not one excepted, (and conſequently the generality which is nothing but a collection of them) is polluted and defiled with ſin? You proceed.</p>
                        <p n="19">19 But, ſay you, <hi>The ſame hereſie follows out of D.</hi> Potter <hi>and other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, that the Church may err in points not fundamental; becauſe we have ſhewed that every error againſt any revealed truth is Hereſie and Damnable, whether the matter be great or ſmall: And how can the Church more truly be ſaid to periſh, than when ſhe is permitted to maintain damnable Hereſie? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we will hereafter prove that by every act of Hereſie all divine faith is loſt, and to maintain a true Church without any faith, is to fancy a living man without life.</hi> Anſw. What you have ſaid before, hath been anſwered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and what you ſhall ſay hereafter, ſhall be confuted hereafter. But if it be ſuch a certain ground, that <hi>every error againſt any one revealed truth is a damnable Hereſie,</hi> then, I hope I ſhall have your leave to ſubſume, That
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:64345:167"/>the Dominicans in your account muſt hold a damnable hereſie, who hold an error againſt the immaculate Conception: which you muſt needs eſteem a revealed truth, or otherwiſe why are you ſo urgent and importunate to have it defined? ſeeing your rule is, <hi>Nothing may be defined, unleſs it be firſt revealed.</hi> But, without your leave, I will make bold to conclude, that, if either that or the contrary aſſertion be a revealed truth, you or they, chuſe you whether, muſt without contradiction hold a damnable Hereſie: if this ground be true that every contradiction of a revealed Truth is ſuch. And now I dare ſay, for fear of inconvenience you will begin to temper the crudeneſs of your former aſſertion, and tell us, that neither of you are He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques, becauſe the Truth againſt which you err though revealed, is not ſufficiently propounded. And ſo ſay I, Neither is your doctrin which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants contradict ſufficiently propounded. For though it be plain enough, that your Church propoſeth it, yet ſtill, me-thinks, it is as plain that your Churches propoſition is not ſufficient; and I deſire you would not ſay but prove the contrary. Laſtly, to your Queſtion, <hi>How can the Church more truly be ſaid to periſh, than when ſhe is permitted to maintain a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hereſie?</hi> I Anſwer, ſhe may be more truly ſaid to periſh, when ſhe is not only permitted to do ſo, but <hi>de facto</hi> doth maintain a damnable Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. Again, ſhe may be more truly ſaid to periſh, when ſhe falls into an Hereſie, which is not only damnable in it ſelf, and <hi>ex natura rei,</hi> as you ſpeak, but ſuch an Hereſie, the belief of whoſe contrary Truth is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not only <hi>neceſsitate praecepti</hi> but <hi>medii,</hi> and therefore the Hereſie ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and indiſpenſably deſtructive of ſalvation, that no ignorance can excuſe it, nor any general repentance, without a dereliction of it, can beg a pardon for it. Such an hereſie if the Church ſhould fall into, it might be more truly ſaid to periſh, then if it fell only into ſome hereſie of its own nature damnable. For, in that ſtate, all the members of it, without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, all without mercy muſt needs periſh for ever: In this, although thoſe that might ſee the truth and would not, cannot upon any good ground hope for ſalvation, yet without queſtion, it might ſend many ſouls to heaven, who would gladly have embrac'd the truth, but that they wanted means to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it. Thirdly and laſtly, ſhe may yet more truly be ſaid to periſh when ſhe Apoſtates from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Towards which ſtate of Perdition it may well be feared that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth ſomewhat incline, by her ſuperinducing upon the reſt of her errors the Doctrin of her own infallibility, whereby her errors are made incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; &amp; by her pretending that the Scripture is to be interpreted according to her doctrin; and not her doctrin to be judg'd of by Scripture, whereby ſhe makes the Scripture uneffectual for her Reformation.</p>
                        <p n="20">20. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 18. I was very glad when I heard you ſay <hi>The Holy Scripture and antient Fathers do aſsign Separation from the viſible Church as a mark of Hereſie:</hi> for I was in good hope, that no Chriſtian would ſo belie the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as to ſay ſo of it, unleſs he could have produced ſome one Text at leaſt, wherein this was plainly affirmed, or from whence it might be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly and undeniably collected. For aſſure your ſelf, good Sir, it is a very hainous crime to ſay, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, when the Lord doth not ſay ſo.</hi> I expected therefore ſome Scripture ſhould have been alledged, wherein it
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:64345:167"/>ſhould have been ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever ſeparates from the Roman Church is an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique:</hi> or <hi>the Roman Church is infallible,</hi> or <hi>the Guide of faith:</hi> or, at leaſt, <hi>There ſhall be always ſome viſible Church infallible in matters of faith.</hi> Some ſuch direction as this I hoped for: And, I pray conſider, whether I had not reaſon! The Evangeliſts and Apoſtles who wrote the new Teſtament, we all ſuppoſe were good men, and very deſirous to direct us the ſureſt and plaineſt way to heaven; we ſuppoſe them likewiſe very ſufficiently inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Spirit of God in all the neceſſary points of the Chriſtian faith, and therefore certainly not ignorant of this <hi>Unum Neceſſarium,</hi> this moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary point of all others, without which, as you pretend and teach, all faith is no Faith, that is, that <hi>the Church of Rome was deſigned by God the guide of Faith.</hi> We ſuppoſe them laſtly wiſe men, eſpecially being aſſiſted by the ſpirit of wiſdom, and ſuch as knew that a doubtful and queſtionable Guide was for mens direction as good as none at all. And after all theſe ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which I preſume no good Chriſtian will call into queſtion, is it poſſible that any Chriſtian heart can believe, that not One amongſt them all ſhould <hi>ad rei memoriam</hi> write this neceſſary doctrin, plainly ſo much as once? Certainly in all reaſon they had provided much better for the good of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, if they had wrote this, though they had writ nothing elſe. Me-thinks, the Evangeliſts, undertaking to write the Goſpel of Chriſt, could not poſſibly have omitted, any one of them, this moſt neceſſary point of faith, had they known it neceſſary, (S. <hi>Luke</hi> eſpecially, who plainly profeſſes that <hi>his intent was to write all things neceſſary.</hi>) Me-thinks S. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Romans</hi> could not but have congratulated this their Priviledge to them! Me-thinks, inſtead of ſaying, <hi>Your faith is ſpoken of, all the world over</hi> (which you have no reaſon to be very proud of, for he ſays the very ſame thing to the <hi>Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians,</hi>) he could not have fail'd to have told them, once at leaſt in plain terms, that <hi>their Faith was the Rule for all the World for ever.</hi> But then ſure he would have forborn to put them in fear of an impoſſibility, as he doth in his eleventh Chapter, that they alſo, nay the whole Church of the <hi>Gentiles, if they did not look to their ſtanding, might fall away to infidelity,</hi> as the Jews had done. Me-thinks, in all his other Epiſtles, at leaſt in ſome, at leaſt in one of them, he could not have failed to have given the world this direction, had he known it to be a true one, that <hi>all men were to be guided by the Church of Rome, and none to ſeparate from it under pain of damnation.</hi> Me-thinks wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſo often of Heretiques and Antichriſt, he ſhould have given the world this (as you pretend) only ſure preſervative from them. How was it poſsible that S. <hi>Peter</hi> writing two Catholick Epiſtles, mentioning his own departure, writing to preſerve Chriſtians in the faith, ſhould in neither of them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to the guidance of his pretended Succeſſours, the Biſhops of <hi>Rome?</hi> How was it poſsible that S. <hi>James,</hi> and S. <hi>Jude</hi> in their Catholique E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles ſhould not give this Catholique direction? Me-thinks, S. <hi>John</hi> inſtead of ſaying, <hi>He that believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God,</hi> (The force of which direction your gloſſes do quite enervate, and make unavailable to diſcern who are the ſons of God,) ſhould have ſaid, <hi>He that adheres to the doctrin of the Roman Church, and lives according to it, he is a good Chriſtian, and by this mark ye ſhall know him!</hi> What man not quite out of his wits, if he conſider as he ſhould, the pretended neceſsity of this doctrin, that without the belief hereof no man ordinarily can be ſaved, can poſsibly force himſelf to conceive that all theſe good and holy men, ſo deſirous of mens ſalvation,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:64345:168"/>and ſo well aſſured of it (as it is pretended,) ſhould be ſo deeply and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſilent in it, and not One of them ſay it plainly ſo much as once, but leave it to be collected from uncertain Principles, by many more uncertain Conſequences? Certainly, he that can judge ſo uncharitably of them, it is no marvel if he cenſure other inferiour ſervants of Chriſt as Atheiſts, and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, and what he pleaſes. Plain places therefore I did and had reaſon to look for, when I heard you ſay, <hi>the holy Scripture aſsigns ſeparation from the viſible Church as a Mark of Hereſie.</hi> But inſtead hereof what have you brought us, but meer impertinencies? S. <hi>John</hi> ſaith of ſome who pretended to be Chriſtians and were not ſo, and therefore when it was for their advantage forſook their profeſſion, <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us</hi> Of ſome, who before the decree of the Councel to the contrary, were perſwaded and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly taught, that the convert Gentiles were to keep the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> it is ſaid in the Acts, <hi>Some who went out from us.</hi> And again S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the ſame book forwarns the Epheſians that <hi>out of them ſhould ariſe men ſpeaking per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe things.</hi> And from theſe places, which it ſeems are the plaineſt you have, you collect, <hi>that ſeparation from the Viſible Church is aſsigned by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture as a Mark of Hereſie.</hi> Which is certainly a ſtrange and unheard-of ſtrain of Logick. Unleſs you will ſay that every Text wherein it is ſaid, that ſome body goes out from ſome body, affords an Argument for this purpoſe! For the firſt place, there is no certainty that it ſpeaks of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques; but, <hi>no Chriſtians,</hi> of <hi>Antichriſts, of ſuch as denied Jeſus to be the Chriſt:</hi> See the place and you ſhall confeſs as much. The ſecond place, it is certain, you muſt not ſay it ſpeaks of Heretiques; for it ſpeaks only of ſome who believed and taught an Error, while it was yet a queſtion, and not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and therefore according to your doctrin no formal Hereſie. The third ſaies indeed, that of the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, ſome ſhall ariſe that ſhall teach Hereſie: But not one of them all that ſays or intimates, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſeparates from the Viſible Church in what ſtate ſoever is certainly an heretique. Heretiques, I confeſs, do always do ſo; But they that do ſo, are are not always Heretiques; for perhaps the ſtate of the Church may make it neceſſary for them to do ſo; as Rebels always diſobey the command of their King, yet they, which diſobey a King's command (which perhaps may be unjuſt) are not preſently Rebels.</p>

Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der again, that he ſays only, that <hi>he was then in Communion with the Chair of</hi> Peter, Not that he alwayes would, or of neceſſity muſt be ſo: for his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the contrary is too evident out of that which he ſaith elſewhere which ſhall be produced hereafter. He ſays, that the <hi>Church at that preſent was built upon that Rock;</hi> but, Not that only, Nor that alwayes. Nay his judgment, as ſhall appear, is expreſs to the contrary. And ſo likewiſe the reſt of his expreſſions (if we mean to reconcile <hi>Hierome</hi> with <hi>Hierome</hi>) muſt be conceived as intended by him, of that Biſhop and Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> at that preſent time, and in the preſent State, and in reſpect of that doctrin which he there intreats of. For otherwiſe, had he conceiv'd it neceſſary for him and all men to conform their judgment in matters of faith, to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Biſhop and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> how came it to paſs that he choſe rather to believe the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> Canonical, upon the authority of the Eaſtern Church, than to reject it from the Canon upon the authority of the <hi>Roman?</hi> How comes it to paſs that he diſſented from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of that Church, touching the Canon of the Old Teſtament?

And if this cannot be denyed, I demand then, If he had lived in <hi>Liberius</hi> his time, could he, or would he, have written ſo to <hi>Liberius,</hi> as he does to <hi>Damaſus?</hi> Would he have ſaid to him, <hi>I am in the Communion of the Chair of</hi> Peter, <hi>I know that the Church is built upon this Rock, Whoſoever gathereth not with thee, ſcattereth.</hi> Would he then have ſaid, the <hi>Roman</hi> faith and the Catholique were the ſame: or, that the <hi>Roman</hi> faith received no deluſions, no not from an Angel? I ſuppoſe, he could not have ſaid ſo with any coherence to his own belief; and therefore conceive it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable that what he ſaid then to <hi>Damaſus,</hi> he ſaid it (though perhaps he ſtreined too high) only of <hi>Damaſus,</hi> and never conceiv'd that his words would have been extended to all his Predeceſſors and all his Succeſſors.</p>
                        <p n="24">24. The ſame Anſwer I make to the firſt place of S. <hi>Ambroſe, viz.</hi> That no more can be certainly concluded from it, but that the Catholique Biſhops and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church were then at unity; ſo that whoſoever agreed with the later could not then but agree with the former. But that this Rule was perpetual, and that no man could ever agree with the Catholique Biſhops, but he muſt agree with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, this he ſayes not, nor gives you any ground to conclude from him. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> when he was excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Liberius,</hi> agreed very ill with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and yet you will not gainſay, but he agreed well enough with the Catholique Biſhops.

For it neither affirms nor imports, that ſeparation from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is a certain mark of Hereſie. For the Rights of Communion (whatſoever it ſignifies,) might be ſaid to flow from it, if that Church were, by Eccleſiaſtical Law, the head of all other Churches: But unleſs it were made ſo by divine Authority, and that abſolutely, Separation from it could not be a mark of Hereſie.</p>

Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſpeaks not of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at all, but of the Biſhop only, who when he doth commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with the Catholique Church, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> at that time did, then who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever communicates with him, cannot but communicate with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church: and then by accident one might truly ſay, ſuch a one commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates with you, that is, with the Catholique Church, and that to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with him is to communicate with the Catholique Church. As if <hi>Titius</hi>
                           <pb n="307" facs="tcp:64345:170"/>and <hi>Sempronius</hi> be together, he that is in company with <hi>Titius,</hi> cannot but be at that time in company with <hi>Sempronius.</hi> As if a General be marching to ſome place with an Army, he that then is with the General muſt at that time be with the Army: And a man may ſay without abſurdity, Such a time I was with the General, that is, with the Army, and that to be with the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral is to be with the Army. Or as if a mans hand be joyned to his body, the finger which is joyned to the hand is joyned to the body, and a man may ſay truly of it, This finger is joyned to the hand, that is, to the body, and, to be joyned to the hand is to be joyned to the body; becauſe all theſe things are by accident true. And yet I hope you would not deny, but the finger might poſſibly be joyned to the hand, and yet not to the body, the hand being cut off from the body; and a man might another time, be with his General and not with his Army, he being abſent from the Army. And therefore by like reaſon your collection is ſophiſtical, being in effect but this, to communicate with ſuch a Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who did communicate with the Catholique Church, was to communicate with the Catholique Church, therefore abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and alwayes it muſt be true, that, To communicate with him, is by conſequent to communicate with the Catholique Church, and to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from his Communion, is to be an Heretique.</p>
                        <p n="28">28. In urging the place of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> you have ſhewed much more ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than many of your Fellows. For whereas they uſually begin at, <hi>Declaring the Tradition of the, &amp;c</hi> and conceal what goes before; you have ſet it down, though not ſo compleatly as you ſhould have done, yet ſufficiently to ſhew, that what authority in the matter he attributed to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, the ſame for the kind (though parhaps not in the ſame degree) he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to all other Apoſtolique Churches. Either therefore you muſt ſay, that he conceived the Teſtimony of other Apoſtolique Churches divine and infallible, (which certainly he did not, neither do you pretend he did, and if he had, the confeſſed Errors and Hereſies which after they fell into would demonſtrate plainly that he had erred) or elſe that he conceived the teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church only humane and credible, though perhaps more credible than any one Church beſide, (as one man's Teſtimony is more credible than anothers;) but certainly much more credible, which was enough for his purpoſe, than that ſecret Tradition, to which thoſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques pretended, againſt whom he wrote over-bearing them with an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own kind, farr ſtronger than their own. Now if <hi>Irenaeus</hi> thought the Teſtimony of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in this point only humane and fallible, then ſurely he could never think, either adhering to it a certain mark of a Catholique, or ſeparation from it a certain mark of an Heretique.</p>
                        <p n="29">29. Again, whereas your great <hi>Achilles</hi> Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> in <hi>French;</hi> as alſo his <hi>Noble Tranſlatreſs,</hi> miſled by him, in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> knowing that mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorting to <hi>Rome</hi> would do his cauſe little ſervice, hath made bold with the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue, as he does very often with the <hi>Greek,</hi> and rendred <hi>Ad hanc Eccleſiam neceſſe eſt omnem convenire Eccleſiam, To this Church it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that every Church ſhould agree,</hi> you have Tranſlated it, as it ſhould be; <hi>to this Church it is neceſſary that all Churches reſort:</hi> wherein you have ſhewed more ſincerity, and have had more regard to make the Author ſpeak ſenſe. For if he had ſaid, <hi>By ſhewing the Tradition of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church we confound all Heretiques; For, to this Church, all Churches muſt agree,</hi> what had this been, but to give for a reaſon, that which was more queſtionable
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:64345:171"/>than the thing in queſtion: as being neither evident in it ſelf, and plainly denyed by his adverſaries, &amp; not at all proved nor offered to be proved here or elſewhere by <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> To ſpeak thus therefore had been weak and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. But on the other ſide, if we conceive him to ſay thus, <hi>You Heretiques de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline a trial of your Doctrin by Scripture, as being corrupted and imperfect, and not fit to determin Controverſies without recourſe to Tradition, and, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead hereof, you fly for a refuge to a ſecret Tradition, which you pretend that you received from your Anceſtors, and they from the Apoſtles; certainly, your calumnies againſt Scripture are moſt unjuſt and unreaſonable: but yet more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, aſſure your ſelves, that if you will be tryed by Tradition, even by that alſo you will be overthrown. For our Tradition is far more famous, more conſtant, and in all reſpects more credible, than that which you pretend to. It were eaſie for me, to muſter up againſt you the uninterrupted ſucceſsions of all the Churches founded by the Apoſtles, all conſpiring in their Teſtimonies againſt you: But becauſe it were too long to number up the Succeſsions of all Churches, I will content my ſelf with the Tradition of the moſt ancient and moſt glorious Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>which alone is ſufficient for the confutation and confuſion of your Doctrin, as being in credit and authority, as farr beyond the Tradition you build upon, as the light of the Sun is beyond the light of a Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm. For to this Church; by reaſon it is placed in the Imperial City, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all mens affairs do neceſſarily draw them, or by reaſon of the powerful principality it hath over all the adjacent Churches, there is, and always hath been, a neceſsity of a perpetual recourſe of all the faithful round about: who if there had been any alteration in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>could not in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity but have obſerved it. But they to the contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have always obſerved in this Church the very Tradition which came from the Apoſtles and no other.</hi> I ſay, if we conceive his meaning thus, his words will be intelligible and rational: which if inſtead of <hi>reſort</hi> we put in <hi>agree</hi> will be quite loſt. Herein there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have been beholding to your honeſty, which makes me think you did not wittingly falſifie, but only twice in this ſentence miſtake <hi>Undique</hi> for <hi>Ubique,</hi> and tranſlate it, <hi>every where,</hi> and <hi>of what place ſoever,</hi> in ſtead of <hi>round about.</hi> For that it was neceſſary <hi>for all the faithful of what place ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to reſort to</hi> Rome, is not true. That <hi>The Apoſtolique Tradition hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes been conſerved there from thoſe who are every where,</hi> is not Senſe. Now inſtead of <hi>conſervata</hi> read <hi>obſervata,</hi> as in all probability it ſhould be, and tranſlate <hi>undique</hi> truly <hi>round about,</hi> and then the ſenſe will be both plain and good; for then it muſt be rendred thus, <hi>For to this Church, by reaſon of a more powerful principality, there is a neceſsity that all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that is, all the faithful round about, ſhould reſort, in which the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Tradition hath been alwayes obſerved by thoſe who were round about.</hi> If any man ſay, I have been too bold a Critick in ſubſtituting <hi>obſervata</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>conſervata,</hi> I deſire him to know, that the conjecture is not mine, and therefore as I expect no praiſe for it, ſo, I hope, I ſhall be farr from cenſure. But I would intreat him to conſider, whether it be not likely that the ſame <hi>Greek</hi> word ſignifying <hi>obſervo</hi> and <hi>conſervo,</hi> the Tranſlater of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> who could hardly ſpeak <hi>Latin,</hi> might not eaſily miſtake, and tranſlate <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>conſervata eſt,</hi> inſtead of <hi>obſervata eſt;</hi> Or, whether it be not likely, that thoſe men which anciently wrote Books, and underſtood them not, might not eaſily commit ſuch an errour; Or, whether the ſenſe of the place can be ſalved any other way; if it can, in God's name let it; if not, I
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:64345:171"/>hope, he is not to be condemned, who with ſuch a little alteration hath made that ſenſe which he found non-ſenſe.</p>
                        <p n="30">30. But whether you will have it <hi>Obſervata</hi> or <hi>Conſervata,</hi> the new <hi>ſumpſimus</hi> or the old <hi>mumpſimus,</hi> poſſibly it may be ſomething to <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> but to us, or our cauſe, it is no way material. For if the reſt be rightly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, neither will <hi>Conſervata</hi> afford you any argument againſt us, nor <hi>Obſervata</hi> help us to any evaſion. For though at the firſt hearing of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious attributes here given, (and that juſtly) to the Church of <hi>Rome, The confounding Heretiques with her Tradition, and ſaying, It is neceſſary for all Churches to reſort to her,</hi> may ſound like Arguments for you; yet he that is attentive, I hope, will eaſily diſcover, that it might be good and rational in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> having to do with Heretiques, who, ſomewhat like thoſe, who would be the only Catholiques, declined a tryal by Scripture, as not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Truth of Chriſt perfectly, and not fit to decide Controverſies, without recourſe to Tradition: I ſay, he will eaſily perceive that it might be rational in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to urge them, with any Tradition of more credit than their own, eſpecially a Tradition conſonant to Scripture, and even contain'd in it; and yet that it may be irrational in you to urge us, who do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline Scripture, but appeal to it as a perfect rule of faith, with a Tradition which we pretend is many wayes repugnant to Scripture; and repugnant to a Tradition farr more general than it ſelf, which gives Teſtimony to Scripture; and laſtly, repugnant to it ſelf as giving atteſtation both to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and to Doctrins plainly contrary to Scripture. Secondly, that the Authority of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was then a farr greater Argument of the Truth of her Tradition when it was United with all other Apoſtolique Churches, than now when it is divided from them, according to that of <hi>Tertullian, Had the Churches erred they would have varied, but that which is the ſame in all, cannot be Error but Tradition;</hi> and therefore <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument may be very probable, yet yours may be worth nothing. Thirdly, that fourteen hundred years may have made a great deal of alteration in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: as Rivers, though neer the fountain they may retain their native and unmixt ſincerity, yet in long progreſs cannot but take in much mixture that came not from the fountain. And therefore the <hi>Roman</hi> Tradition, though then pure, may now be corruptand impure: and ſo this Argument (being one of thoſe things which are the worſe for wearing) might in <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his time be ſtrong and vigorous, and after declining and decaying may long ſince have fallen to nothing. Eſpecially, conſidering that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> playes the Hiſtorian only, and not the Prophet, and ſayes only, that the <hi>Apoſtolique Tradition had been alwayes there as in other Apoſtolique Churches conſerved or obſerved,</hi> chooſe you whether, but that <hi>it ſhould be alwayes ſo,</hi> he ſayes not, neither had he any warrant. He knew well enough that there was foretold a <hi>great falling away</hi> of the Churches of Chriſt to Anti-chriſt: that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in particular was fore-warned that ſhe alſo,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> 
                           <hi>Nay the whole Church of the Gentiles might fall if they lookt not to their ſtanding:</hi> and therefore to ſecure her that ſhe ſhould ſtand for ever, he had no Reaſon, nor Authority. Fourthly, that it appears manifeſtly out of this Book of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> quoted by you, that the doctrin of the Chiliaſts was in his judgement Apoſtolique Tradition, as alſo it was eſteemed (for ought appears to the contrary) by all the Doctors, and Saints, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of or about his time, for all that ſpeak of it, or whoſe judgements
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:64345:172"/>in the point are any way recorded, are for it: and <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> profeſſeth that <hi>all good and Orthodox Chriſtians of his time believed it,</hi> and thoſe that did not,<note place="margin">In Dial. cum Tryphon.</note> he reckons amongſt Heretiques. Now I demand, was this Tradition one of thoſe that was conſerved, and obſerved in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or was it not? If not, had <hi>Irenaeus</hi> known ſo much, he muſt have retracted this commendation of that Church. If it was, then the Tradition of the preſent Church of <hi>Rome</hi> contradicts the Ancient, and accounts it Heretical, and then ſure it can be no certain note of Hereſie to depart from them, who have departed from themſelves, and prove themſelves ſubject unto Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour by holding contradictions. Fifthly and laſtly, that out of the Story of the Church it is as manifeſt as the light at noon, that though <hi>Irenaeus</hi> did eſteem the <hi>Roman</hi> Tradition a great Argument of the doctrin which he there delivers and defends againſt the Heretiques of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ime, <hi>viz. That there is one God,</hi> yet he was very far from thinking that Church was, and ever ſhould be a ſafe keeper, and an infallible witneſs of Tradition in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: Inaſmuch as in his own life, his action proclaim'd the contrary. For when <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> obtruded the <hi>Roman</hi> Tradition touching the time of <hi>Eaſter</hi> upon <hi>Aſian</hi> Biſhops under the pain of Excommunication, and <hi>damnation; Irenaeus,</hi> and all the other Weſtern Biſhops, though agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him in his obſervation, yet ſharply reprehended him for excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating the <hi>Aſian</hi> Biſhops for their diſagreeing, plainly ſhewing that they eſteemed that not a neceſſary doctrin and a ſufficient ground of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, which the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and his adherents did ſo account of: For otherwiſe how could they have reprehended him for excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating them, had they conceived the cauſe of this Excommunication juſt and ſufficient? And beſides, evidently declaring that they eſteemed not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church a certain mark of Hereſie, ſeeing they eſteemed not them Heretiques though ſeparated and cut off from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church.</p>

To the firſt then we ſay, that ſo farr is this Epiſtle of</hi> Polycrates <hi>from abating and diminiſhing the Popes authority, that contrariwiſe it greatly magnifies and exalts it.

And that the Councils of</hi> Nicea, <hi>of</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, <hi>of</hi> Epheſus, <hi>embraced the Cenſure of</hi> Victor, <hi>and excommunicated thoſe that obſerved the cuſtom of</hi> Polycrates <hi>that was deceived, in believing that the Popes commandement, was againſt Gods commandement? And that S.</hi> JEROM <hi>himſelf celebrates the Paſchal Homilies of</hi> Theophilus <hi>Patriarch of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>which followed the Order of</hi> Nicea <hi>concerning the</hi> Paſche; <hi>doth it not juſtifie, that when S.</hi> JEROM <hi>ſaith, That he reports the Epiſtle of</hi> Polycrates, to ſhew the ſpirit, and authority of the man, <hi>he intends by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, not authority of right, but of fact; that is to ſay, the credit that</hi> Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates <hi>had amongſt the</hi> Aſians, <hi>and other</hi> Quarto decimans?</p>
                        <p>Theſe are the Cardinal's words, the moſt material and conſiderable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages whereof, to ſave the trouble of repetition, I have noted with letters of reference: whereunto my anſwers noted reſpectively with the ſame letters, follow now in order.</p>
                        <p>(a) If <hi>Euſebius</hi> were an <hi>Arrian</hi> author, it is nothing to the purpoſe; what he writes there is no <hi>Arrianiſm,</hi> nor any thing towards it. Never any error was imputed to the <hi>Arrians</hi> for denying the Authority or the infallibility of the Biſhop or Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Beſides, what <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſays, he ſays out of <hi>Irenaeus:</hi> Neither doth, or can the Cardinal deny the ſtory to be true, and therefore he goes about by indirect Arts to foil it, and caſt a blurr upon it. Laſtly, whenſoever <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſays any thing, which the Cardinal thinks for the advantage of his ſide, he cites him, and then he is no <hi>Arrian:</hi> or at leaſt he would not take that for an anſwer to the arguments he draws out of him.</p>
                        <p>(b) That <hi>Ruffinus</hi> was enemy to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is ſaid, but not proved, neither can it be.</p>
                        <p>(c) <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſays the ſame alſo of <hi>caeteri omnes Epiſcopi,</hi> all the other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, That they adviſed <hi>Victor</hi> to keep thoſe things, that belonged to peace and unity, and that they ſharply reprehended <hi>Victor,</hi> for having done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                        <p>(d) This is ſaid, but no offer made of any proof of it: The Cardinal thinks we muſt take every thing upon his word. They to whom the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was delivered, <hi>Polycrates</hi> and the <hi>Aſian</hi> Biſhops, knew no ſuch matter, nay, profeſſed the contrary. And who is more likely to know the Truth, they which lived within two ages of the fountain of it, or the Cardinal who lived ſixteen ages after it?</p>
                        <p>(e) How can it make againſt thoſe that object it: ſeeing it is evident from <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Reprehenſion, that he thought <hi>Victor</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, no infallible nor ſufficient Judge, of what was neceſſary to be believed and done, what not: what was univerſal Tradition, what not:
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:64345:173"/>what was a ſufficient ground of Excommunication, and what not: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that there was no ſuch neceſſity as is pretended, that all other Churches ſhould, in matters of faith, conform themſelves to the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(f) This is to ſuppoſe, that Excommunication is an Act, or Argument, or ſign of Power and Authority in the party excommunicating, over the party excommunicated; whereas it is undeniably evident out of the Church-Story, that it was often uſed by Equals upon Equals, and by Inferiours up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Superiours, if the Equals or Inferiours, thought their Equals or Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours did any thing which deſerved it.</p>
                        <p>(g) And what is this but to confeſs, that they thought that a ſmall cauſe of Excommunication and unſufficient, which <hi>Victor</hi> and his adherents thought great and ſufficient? And conſequently, that <hi>Victor</hi> and his Part declared that to be a matter of faith and of neceſſity, which they thought not ſo; And where was then their conformity?</p>
                        <p>(h) True, you have ſo expounded it, but not proved nor offered any proof of your exception. This alſo we muſt take upon your Authority. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſpeaks not one Word of any other power, to which he compares, or before which he preferrs, the power of the <hi>Roman</hi>-Church. And it is evident out of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi>
                           <note n="*" place="margin">Cant. 28.</note> That <hi>all the Principality which it had, was given</hi> it (not by God, but) <hi>by the Church, in regard it was ſeated in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial City.</hi> Whereupon, when afterwards <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was the Imperial City, they decreed that <hi>that Church ſhould have equal Priviledges and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and preheminence with the Church of</hi> Rome. All the Fathers agreed in this Decree, ſaving only the Legats of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> ſhewing plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they never thought of any Supremacy given the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> by God, or grounded upon Scripture, but only by the Church, and therefore alterable at the Churches pleaſure.</p>
                        <p>(i) This is falſely tranſlated. <hi>Convenire ad Romanam Eccleſiam,</hi> every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy knows, ſignifies no more but to reſort or come to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: which then there was a neceſſity that men ſhould do, becauſe that the affairs of the Empire were tranſacted in that place. But yet <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſayes not ſo of every Church ſimply, which had not been true but only of the Adjacent Churches: for ſo he expounds himſelf in ſaying, <hi>To this Church it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that every Church,</hi> that is, all the faithful, <hi>round about ſhould reſort.</hi> With much more reaſon therefore we return the Argument thus. Had <hi>Irenaeus</hi> thought that all Churches muſt of neceſſity agree with the <hi>Roman,</hi> how could he and all other Biſhops have then pronounc'd, that to be no matter of Faith, no ſufficient ground of Excommunication, which <hi>Victor</hi> &amp; his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents thought to be ſo? And how then could they have reprehended <hi>Victor</hi> ſo much, for the ill uſe of his power, as Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> confeſſes they did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing, if that was true which is pretended, in this alſo as well as other things, it was neceſſary for them to agree with the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Some there are that ſay but more wittily than truly, that all Cardinal <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmines</hi> works, are ſo conſonant to themſelves, as if he had written them in two hours. Had Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> wrote his Book in two hours, ſure he would not have done that here in the middle of the Book, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns in the beginning of it. For here he urgeth a Conſequence, drawn from the miſtaken words of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> againſt his lively and actual practice: which Proceeding, there he juſtly condemns of evident injuſtice. His
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:64345:174"/>words are<note n="*" place="margin">In his Letter to <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end.</note> 
                           <hi>For who knows not that it is too great an injuſtice to alleage conſequences from paſſages, and even thoſe ill interpreted and miſunderſtood, and in whoſe Illation there is always ſome Paralogiſm hid againſt the expreſs words, and the lively and actual practiſe of the ſame Fathers from whom they are collected: and that it may be good, to take the Fathers for Adverſaries, and to accuſe them for want of ſenſe or memory: but not to take them for Judges, and to ſubmit themſelves to the obſervation of what they have believ'd and practiſed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>(k) This is nothing to the purpoſe: he might chooſe theſe examples, not as of greater force and authority in themſelves, but as fitter to be imployed againſt <hi>Victor,</hi> as domeſtique examples are fitter and more effectual than forrain: and for his omitting to preſs him with his own example and others, to what purpoſe had it been to uſe them, ſeeing their Letters ſent to <hi>Victor</hi> from all parts, wherein they reprehend his preſumption, ſhewed him ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, that their example was againſt him. But beſides, he that reads <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> his Letter, ſhall ſee, that in the matter of the Lent-Faſt, and the great variety about the celebration of it, which he parallels with this of Eaſter, he preſſeth <hi>Victor</hi> with the example of himſelf and others, not Biſhops of <hi>Rome; Both they</hi> (ſaith he, ſpeaking of other Biſhops), <hi>notwithſtanding this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, retained peace among themſelves;</hi> and <hi>we alſo among our ſelves retain it;</hi> inferring from his example, that <hi>Victor</hi> alſo ought to do ſo.</p>
                        <p>(l) If the Pope's proceeding was juſt, then the Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and in the ſight of God excommunicate, and out of the ſtate of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: which <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and all the other ancient Biſhops never thought. And if they were ſo, why do you account them Saints and Martyrs? But the truth is, that theſe Councels did no way ſhew the Pope's proceedings juſt, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the contrary. For though they ſetled an uniformity in this matter, yet they ſetled it as a matter formerly indifferent, and not as a matrer of faith or neceſſity, as it is evident out of<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>In ep. ad Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copos in Africa:</hi> Where he clearly ſhews that this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was not a queſtion was not a queſtion of faith, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of</hi> Nice <hi>was celebrated, by occaſion of the</hi> Arrian Hereſie <hi>and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about Eaſter. In ſo much as</hi> they in Syria <hi>and</hi> Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia <hi>and</hi> Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia, <hi>did differ herein from</hi> us, and <hi>kept</hi> this Feaſt <hi>on the ſame</hi> day with the <hi>Jews:</hi> But thanks <hi>be to</hi> God, an agreement was made, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Faith, ſo alſo concerning this holy Feaſt.</note> 
                           <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> and conſequently, they rather declare <hi>Victor</hi>'s proceeding unjuſt, who excommunicated ſo many Churches, for differing from him in an indifferent matter.</p>
                        <p>(m) It ſeems then <hi>Polycrates</hi> might be a Saint and a Martyr, and yet think the commands of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, enjoyned upon pain of damnation, contrary to the commandements of God. Beſides, S. <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, the head of the Church, the Vicar of Chriſt (as you pretend), made this very anſwer to the high Prieſt; yet I hope, you will not ſay, he was his inferior and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to obey him. Laſtly, who ſees not, that when the Pope commands us any thing unjuſt, as to communicate Lay-men in one kind, to uſe the <hi>Latin</hi> Service, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we may very fitly ſay to him, <hi>It is better to obey God than men,</hi> and yet never think of any authority he hath over us?</p>
                        <p>(n) Between requeſting and ſummoning, me-thinks, there ſhould be ſome difference; and <hi>Polycrates</hi> ſays no more, but <hi>he was requeſted by the Church of Rome</hi> to call them, and did ſo. Here then (as very often) the Cardinal is fain to help the dice with a falſe tranſlation; and, his pretence being falſe, every one muſt ſee that that which he pretends to be inſinuated by it, is clearly inconſequent.</p>
                        <p>(o) <hi>Polycrates</hi> was deceived, if he believed it to be againſt Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and the Pope deceived as much, in thinking it to be Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, for it was neither one nor the other, but an indifferent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein God had not interpoſed his Authority. Neither did the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:64345:174"/>Councel of Nice embrace the Cenſure of <hi>Victor,</hi> by acknowledging his Excommunication to be juſt and well grounded, for which the Cardinal neither doth pretend, nor can produce any proof, any way comparable to the fore-alledged words of <hi>Athanaſius</hi> teſtifying the contrary; though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, having ſetled the obſervation, and reduced it to an uniformity, they might excommunicate thoſe who afterward ſhould trouble the Churches peace for an indifferent matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And thus much for <hi>Irenaeus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="31">31 I come now to S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and to the firſt place out of him, where he <hi>ſeems to ſay, that the Succeſsion in the Sea of</hi> Peter, <hi>was the Rock which our Saviour meant when he ſaid, Upon this Rock,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, firſt, we have no reaſon to be confident of the truth hereof, becauſe S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf was not, but retracts it as uncertain, and <hi>leaves to the Reader whether he will think that, or another more probable. Retr. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 26. Secondly, What he ſays of the Succeſſion in the Roman Church in this place, he ſays it elſewhere, of all the Succeſſions in all other Apoſtolique Churches. Thirdly, that as in this place he urgeth the Donatiſts with ſeparation from the Roman Church, an Argument of their Errour: So, elſewhere he preſſeth them with their Separation from other Apoſtolique Churches, nay more from theſe than from that, becauſe in <hi>Rome</hi> the Donatiſts had a Biſhop though not a perpetual Succeſſion of them; but in other Apoſtolique Churches they wanted both. <hi>Theſe ſcatter'd men</hi> (ſaith he of the Donatiſts <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 165.) <hi>read in the holy books the Churches to which the Apoſtles wrote, and have no Biſhop in them: But what is more perverſe and mad, than to the Lectors reading theſe Epiſtles to ſay, Peace with you, and to ſeparate from the peace of theſe Churches, to which theſe Epiſtles were written?</hi> So <hi>Optatus,</hi> having done you (as it might ſeem, great ſervice) in upbraiding the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts as Schiſmatiques, becauſe they had not Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> overthrows and undoes it all again, and as it were with a ſpunge wipes out all that he hath ſaid for you, by adding after, that they were Schiſmatiques, becauſe <hi>They had not the fellowſhip of Communion with the ſeven Churches of Aſia, to which S.</hi> John <hi>writes:</hi> whereof he pronounces confidently, (though I know not upon what ground) <hi>Extraſeptem Eccleſias quicquid foris eſt, alienum eſt.</hi> Now, I pray tell me, do you eſteem the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of theſe Fathers a ſufficient aſſurance, that ſeparation from theſe other Apoſtolique Churches, was a certain mark of Hereſie, or not? If ſo, then your Church hath been for many Ages heretical. If not, How is their authority, a greater Argument for the Roman, than for the other Churches? If you ſay, they conceived ſeparation from theſe Churches a note of Schiſm, only when they were united to the Roman: ſo alſo they might conceive of the Roman, only when it was united to them. If you ſay, they urg'd this only as a probable, and not as a certain Argument, ſo alſo they might do that. In a word, whatſoever anſwer you can deviſe to ſhew, that theſe Fathers made not ſeparation from theſe other Churches a mark of Hereſie, apply that to your own Argument, and it will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</p>
                        <p n="32">32 The other place is evidently impertinent to the preſent queſtion, nor is there it in any thing but this, That <hi>Caecilian might contemn the multitude of his adverſaries, becauſe thoſe that were united with him were more, and of more account than thoſe that were againſt him.</hi> Had he preferr'd the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church alone, before <hi>Caecilian</hi>'s enemies, this had been little, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;

                        <p n="33">33. Thus you ſee his words make very little, or indeed nothing for you. But now his Action, which according to Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi>'s rule, is much more to be regarded than his words, as not being ſo obnoxious to miſinterpretation, I mean his famous oppoſition of three Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> in Succeſſion, touching the great queſtion of Appeals, wherein he and the reſt of the African Biſhops proceeded ſo far in the firſt or ſecond <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levitan</hi> Councel, as to<note n="(b)" place="margin">

Certainly, if you will ſtand to <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s judgment, you muſt either grant the authority of the Roman Church (though at that time a good Topical Argument, and perhaps a better than any the Heretiques had, eſpecially in conjunction with other Apoſtolique Churches:) yet, I ſay, you muſt grant it perforce but a fallible Guide as well as that of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> and <hi>Philippi,</hi> and <hi>Corinth:</hi> or you muſt maintain the Authority of every one of theſe infallible, as well as the Roman. For though he make a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyrick of the Roman Church in particular, and of the reſt only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, yet, as I have ſaid, for point of direction he makes them all equal, and therefore makes them (chuſe you whether) either all fallible, or all infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible: Now you will and muſt acknowledge that he never intended to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute infallibility to the Churches of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> or <hi>Corinth:</hi> or, if he did, that (as experience ſhews) he erred in doing ſo; and what can hinder, but then we may ſay alſo that he never intended to attribute infallibility to the Roman Church, or, if he did, that he erred in doing ſo?</p>
                        <p n="35">35 From the ſaying of S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> certainly nothing can be gathered; but only <hi>that the Biſhop of Rome may diſcern between that which is counterfeit, and that which is lawful and pure, and without any diminution may preach the faith of our Anceſtors.</hi> Which certainly he might do, if ambition and covetouſneſs did not hinder him, or elſe I ſhould never condemn him for doing otherwiſe. But is there no difference between <hi>may</hi> and <hi>muſt?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween he may do ſo, and he cannot but do ſo? Or doth it follow, becauſe he may do ſo, therefore he always ſhall or will do ſo? In my opinion rather the contrary ſhould follow! For he that ſaith, you may do thus, implies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinary ſenſe of words, that if he will he may do otherwiſe. You certainly may, if you pleaſe, leave abuſing the world with ſuch So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry as this; but whether you will or no, of that I have no aſſurance.</p>

Of that <hi>Maximianus</hi> who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> I can find no ſuch thing in the Councels: Neither can I believe that any Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> twelve hundred years ago was ſo baſe a paraſite of the Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi>

But beſides, I have little reaſon to be confident that this Epiſtle is not a forgery; for certainly, <hi>Binius</hi> hath obtruded upon us

                        <p n="38">38 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 20, 21, 22, 23. The ſum of your diſcourſe in the four next Sections, if it be pertinent to the Queſtion in agitation, muſt be this: <hi>Want of ſucceſsion of Biſhops and Paſtors, holding always the ſame doctrin, and of the forms of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining Biſhops and Prieſts which are in uſe in the Roman Church, is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mark of Hereſie: but Proteſtants want all theſe things: Therefore they are Heretiques.</hi> To which I anſwer, that nothing but want of truth and holding error can make or prove any man or Church heretical. For if he be a true Ariſtotelian, or Platoniſt, or Pyrrhonian, or Epicurean, who holds the doctrin of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or <hi>Plato,</hi> or <hi>Pirrho,</hi> or <hi>Epicurus,</hi> although he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſſign any that held it before him for many ages together; why ſhould I not be made a true and orthodox Chriſtian, by believing all the doctrin of Chriſt, though I cannot derive my deſcent from a perpetual Succeſſion that believ'd it before me? By this reaſon you ſhould ſay as well, that no man can be a good Biſhop or Paſtor, or King or Magiſtrate, or Father, that ſucceeds a bad one. For, if I may conform my will and actions to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, why may I not embrace his doctrin with my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, although my predeceſſor do not ſo? You have above in this Chapter defin'd <hi>Faith, A free Infallible, obſcure, ſupernatural aſſent to divine Truths, becauſe they are revealed by God and ſufficiently propounded:</hi> This definition is very phanraſtical; but for the preſent I will let it paſs, and deſire you to give me ſome piece or ſhadow of reaſon, why I may not do all this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a perpetual Succeſsion of Biſhops and Paſtors that have done ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me? You may judge as uncharitably, and ſpeak as malitiouſly of me, as your blind zeal to your Superſtition ſhall direct you, but certainly I know, (and with all your Sophiſtry you cannot make me doubt of what I know,) that I do believe the Goſpel of Chriſt (as it is delivered in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted books of Canonical Scripture,) as verily as that it is now day, that I ſee the light, that I am now writing: and I believe it upon this Motive, becauſe I conceive it ſufficiently, abundantly, ſuperabundantly proved to be divine Revelation: and yet in this, I do not depend upon any Succeſsion of men that have alwayes believed it without any mixture of Errour; nay I am fully perſwaded, there hath been no ſucceſsion, and yet do not find my ſelf any way weakned in my faith by the want of it, but ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſured of the truth of it, that not only though your Divels at <hi>Lowden</hi> do tricks againſt it, but though an Angel from heaven ſhould gainſay it or any part of it, I perſwade my ſelf that I ſhould not be moved. This I ſay, and this I am ſure is true: and if you will be ſo hyperſceptical as to perſwade me, that I am not ſure that I do believe all this, I deſire you to tell me, how are you ſure that you believe the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> For, if a man may perſwade himſelf he doth believe what he doth not believe, then may you think you believe the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet not believe it. But if no man can err concerning what he believes, then you muſt give me leave to aſſure my ſelf that I do believe, and conſequently, that any man may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the foreſaid truths upon the foreſaid motives, without any dependance upon any ſucceſsion that hath believed it always. And as from your defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Faith, ſo from your definition of Hereſie, this phancy may be
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:64345:176"/>refuted. For queſtionleſs no man can be an Heretique but he that holds an Hereſie, and an Hereſie you ſay <hi>is a Voluntary error;</hi> therefore no man can be neceſſitated to be an Heretique whether he will or no, by want of ſuch a thing that is not in his power to have: But that there ſhould have been a perpetual Succeſſion of Believers in all points Orthodox, is not a thing which is in our own power, therefore our being or not being Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques depends not on it. Beſides, What is more certain, than that he may make a ſtraight line who hath a Rule to make it by, though never man in the world had made any before: and why then may not he that believes the Scripture to be the word of God, and the Rule of faith, regulate his faith by it, and conſequently believe aright, without much regarding what other men will do or have done? It is true indeed there is a neceſsity that if God will have his word believed, he by his Providence muſt take order, that, either by ſucceſsion of men, or by ſome other means natural or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, it be preſerv'd and delivered, and ſufficiently notified to be his word; but that this ſhould be done by a Succeſsion of men that holds no error againſt it, certainly there is no more neceſsity, than that it ſhould be done by a Succeſsion of men that commit no ſin againſt it. For if men may preſerve the Records of a Law, and yet tranſgreſs it, certainly they may alſo preſerve directions for their faith, and yet not follow them. I doubt not but Lawyers at the Bar do find by frequent experience, that many men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and produce evidences, which being examined, of times make againſt themſelves. This they do ignorantly, it being in their power to ſuppreſs, or perhaps to alter them. And why then ſhould any man conceive it ſtrange, that an erroncous and corrupted Church ſhould preſerve and deliver the Scriptures uncorrupted, when indeed for many reaſons which I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly alledged, it was impoſſible for them to corrupt them? Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is all the neceſſity that is pretended of a perpetual Succeſsion of men otthodox in all points, certainly there is no neceſsity at all of any ſuch, neither can the want of it prove any man or any Church Heretical.</p>
                        <p n="39">39 When therefore you have produced ſome proof of this, which was your Major in your former Syllogiſm, That want of Succeſsion is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mark of Hereſie, you ſhall then receive a full anſwer to your Minor. We ſhall then conſider whether your indelibe Character be any reality, or whether it be a creature of your own making, a fancy of your own imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? And if it be a thing, and not only a word, whether our Biſhops and Prieſts have it not as well as yours; and whether ſome mens perſwaſion that there is no ſuch thing, can hinder them from having it, or prove that they have it not if there be any ſuch thing! (Any more than a mans perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he has not taken Phyſick or Poyſon, will make him not to have taken it if he has, or hinder the operation of it?) And whether <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the place quoted by you, ſpeak of a Prieſt made a Layman, by juſt depoſition or degradation, and not by a voluntary deſertion of his Order? And whether in the ſame place he ſet not ſome mark upon Heretiques that will agree to your Church? Whether all the Authority of our Biſhops in <hi>England</hi> before the Reformation, was conferr'd on them by the Pope? And if it were, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were the Pope's right, or an uſurpation? If it were his right, Whether by Divine Law or Eccleſiaſtical? And, if by Eccleſiaſtical only, Whether he might poſsibly ſo abuſe his power, as to deſerve to loſe it? Whether <hi>de facto</hi> he had done ſo? Whether, ſuppoſing he had deſerved to loſe it,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:64345:177"/>thoſe that deprived him of it, had power to make it from him? Or if not, Whether they had power to ſuſpend him from the uſe of it, until good caution were put in, and good aſſurance given, that, if he had it again, he would not abuſe it as he had formerly done? Whether in caſe, they had done unlawfully that took his power from him, it may not (things being now ſetled, and the preſent Government eſtabliſhed) be as unlawful to go about to reſtore it? Whether it be not a Fallacy to conclude, Becauſe we believe the Pope hath no power in <hi>England,</hi> now when the King and State and Church hath deprived him upon juſt grounds of it, therefore we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe that he had any before his deprivation? Whether, without Schiſm, a man may not withdraw obedience from an uſurp'd Authority commanding unlawful things? Whether the Roman Church might not give authority to Biſhops and Prieſts to oppoſe her errors, as well as a King gives Authority to a Judge to judge againſt him, if his cauſe be bad; as well as <hi>Trajan</hi> gave his ſword to his Praefect with this Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that, <hi>If he governed well, he ſhould uſe it for him; if ill, againſt him.</hi> Whether the Roman Church gave not Authority to her Biſhops and Prieſts to preach againſt her corruptions in manners? And if ſo, Why not againſt her errors in doctrin, if ſhe had any? Whether ſhe gave them not authority to preach the whole Goſpel of Chriſt, and conſequently againſt her doctrin, if it ſhould contradict any part of the Goſpel of Chriſt? Whether it be not acknowledged lawful in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for any Lay-man or woman, that has ability, to perſwade others by word or by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from errour, and unto truth? And why this liberty may not be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt their Religion, if it be falſe; as well as for it, if it be true? Whether any man need any other commiſſion or vocation than that of a Chriſtian, to do a work of charity? And whether it be not one of the greateſt works of charity (if it be done after a peaceable manner, and without any unneceſſary diſturbance of order) to perſwade men out a falſe, unto a true way of eternal happineſs? Eſpecially, the Apoſtle having aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd us, that he (whoſoever he is) <hi>who converteth a ſinner from the error of his way, ſhall ſave a ſoul from death, and ſhall hide a multitude of ſins?</hi> Whether the firſt Reformed Biſhops died all at once, ſo that there were not enough to ordain Others in the places that were vacant? Whether the Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> may not conſecrate a Metropolitan of <hi>England,</hi> as well as the Cardinals do the Pope? Whether the King or Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or they that have the government in their hands, in the minority of the Prince, may not lawfully commend one to them to be conſecrated, againſt whom there is no Canonical exception? Whether the Doctrin, that the King is Supreme Head of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (as the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the firſt Chriſtian Emperours were of the Jewiſh and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church) be any new found doctrin? Whether it may not be true, that Biſhops being made Biſhops, have their authority immediatly from Chriſt, though this or that man be not made Biſhop without the King's authority; as well as you ſay, the Pope being Pope, has authority immediately from Chriſt, and yet this or that man cannot be made Pope without the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Cardinals? Whether you do well to ſuppoſe, that Chriſtian Kings have no more authority in ordering the affairs of the Church, than the great Turk, or the Pagan Emperors? Whether the King may not give authority to a Biſhop to exerciſe his function in ſome part of his Kingdom,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:64345:177"/>and yet not be capable of doing it himſelf: as well as a Biſhop may give authority to a Phyſician to practiſe Phyſick in his Dioceſs, which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop cannot do himſelf? Whether, if <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperour would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded S. <hi>Peter</hi> or S. <hi>Paul</hi> to preach the Goſpel of Chriſt, and to exerciſe the office of a Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> whether they would have queſtion'd his Authority to do ſo? Whether there were any Law of God or man; that prohibited King <hi>JAMES</hi> to give Commiſsion to Biſhops, nay to lay his Injunction upon them, to do any thing that is lawful? Whether a caſual irregularity may not be lawfully diſpenſ'd with? Whether the Pope's irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities, if he ſhould chance to incur any, be indiſpenſable? And if not, who is he, or who are they, whom the Pope is ſo ſubject unto, that they may diſpenſe with him? Whether that be certain which you take for granted; <hi>That your Ordination imprints a character, and ours doth not?</hi> Whether the power of conſecrating and ordaining by impoſition of hands, may not reſide in the Biſhops, and be derived unto them, not from the King but God; and yet the King have authority to command them to apply this power to ſuch a fit perſon, whom he ſhall commend unto them: As well as if ſome Architects only had the faculty of architecture, and had it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly by infuſion from God himſelf, yet, if they were the King's ſubjects, he wants not authority to command them to build him a Palace for his uſe, or a Fortreſs for his ſervice: Or as the King of <hi>France</hi> pretends not to have power to make Prieſts himſelf, yet, I hope, you will not deny him power to command any of his ſubjects that has this power, to ordain any fit perſon Prieſt, whom he ſhall deſire to be ordained? Whether it do not follow, that whenſoever the King commands an houſe to be built, a meſſage to be delivered, or a murtherer to be executed, that all theſe things are preſently done without intervention of the Archirect, meſſenger, or executioner: As well as, that they are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> ordain'd and conſecrated, who by the King's authority are commended to the Biſhops to be ordained and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated: Eſpecially, ſeeing the King will not deny, but that theſe Biſhops may refuſe to do what he requires to be done, lawfully if the perſon be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy; if worthy, unlawfully indeed, but yet <hi>de facto</hi> they may refuſe: and, in caſe they ſhould do ſo, whether juſtly or unjuſtly; neither the King himſelf, nor any body elſe, would eſteem the perſon Biſhop upon the King's deſignation? Whether many Popes, though they were not conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Biſhops by any temporal Prince, yet might not, or did not receive authority from the Emperor to exerciſe their Epiſcopal function in this or that place? And whether the Emperours had not authority, upon their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, to deprive them of their juriſdiction, by impriſonment or baniſhment? Whether Proteſtants do indeed pretend that their Reformation is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal? Whether in ſaying, the <hi>Donatiſts Sect was confined to</hi> Africa, you do not forget your ſelf, and contradict what you ſaid above, in §. 17. of this Chapter where you tell us, <hi>they had ſome of their Sect reſiding in</hi> Rome? Whether it be certain, that none can admit of Biſhops willingly, but thoſe that hold them of divine inſtitution? Whether they may not be willing to have them, conceiving that way of government the beſt, though not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary? Whether all thoſe Proteſtants that conceive the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between Prieſts and Biſhops not to be of divine inſtitution, be Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and Heretical for thinking ſo? Whether your form of ordaining Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Prieſts, be eſſential to the conſtitution of a true Church? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:64345:178"/>the forms of the Church of <hi>England</hi> differ eſſentially from your forms? Whether in ſaying, that <hi>the true Church cannot ſubſiſt without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted true Biſhops and Prieſts,</hi> you have not overthrown the truth of your own Church: wherein I have proved it plainly impoſſible, that any man ſhould be ſo much as morally certain, either of his own Prieſthood or any other man? Laſtly, Whether any one kind of theſe external forms and orders, and government, be ſo neceſſary to the being of a Church, but that they may be diverſe in diverſe places, and that a good and peaceable Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian may and ought to ſubmit himſelf to the Government of the place where he lives, whatſoever it be? All theſe queſtions will be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be diſcuſſed for the clearing of the truth of the <hi>Minor</hi> propoſition of your former Syllogiſm, and your proofs of it: and I will promiſe to debate them fairly with you, if firſt you will bring ſome better proof of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, That want of Succeſsion is a certain note of Hereſie,</hi> which for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent remains both unprov'd and unprobable.</p>
                        <p n="40">40 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 23. <hi>The Fathers,</hi> you ſay, <hi>aſsign Succeſsion as one mark of the true Church:</hi> I confeſs, they did urge Tradition as an Argument of the truth of their doctrin and of the falſhood of the contrary; and thus far they agree with you. But now ſee the difference: They urg'd it not againſt all Heretiques that ever ſhould be, but againſt them who rejected a great part of the Scripture, for no other reaſon but <hi>becauſe it was repugnant to their doctrin, and corrupted other parts with their additions and detractions, and perverted the remainder with divers abſurd interpretations:</hi> So <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> not a leaf before the words by you cited. Nay they urg'd it againſt them who <hi>when they were confuted out of Scripture, fell to accuſe the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures themſelves as if they were not right, and came not from good authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as if they were various one from another, and as if truth could not be found out of them, by thoſe who know not Tradition, for that it was not delivered in writing,</hi> (they did mean wholly,) <hi>but by word of mouth: And that thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Paul <hi>alſo ſaid, we ſpeak wiſdom amongſt the perfect.</hi> So <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in the very next Chapter before that which you alledge. Againſt theſe men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus neceſſitated to do ſo, they did urge Tradition, but what or whoſe Tradition was it? Certainly no other, but the joint Tradition of all the Apoſtolique Churches with one mouth and one voice teaching the ſame doctrin. Or if, for brevity ſake, they produced the Tradition of any one Church, yet is it apparent, that, that one was then in conjunction with all the reſt; <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen,</hi> teſtifie as much in the words cited, and S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> in the place before alledged by me. This Tradition they did urge againſt theſe men, and in a time, in compariſon of ours, almoſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous to the Apoſtles: So near, that one of them, <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> was Scholar to one who was Scholar to S. <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle. <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Origen</hi> were not an age remov'd from him: and the laſt of them all, little more then an age from them. Yet after all this they urg'd it not as a demonſtration, but only as a very probable argument, far greater then any their Adverſaries could oppoſe againſt it. So <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the place above quoted §. 5. <hi>How is it likely that ſo many and ſo great Churches ſhould err in one faith</hi> (it ſhould be, ſhould have erred into one faith.) And this was the condition of this argument as the Fathers urg'd it. Now if you having to deal with us, who queſtion no Book of Scripture, which was not anciently queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſome whom you your ſelves eſteem good Catholiques; nay who
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:64345:178"/>refuſe not to be tried by your own Canon, and your own Tranſlation, who in interpreting Scriptures are content to allow of all thoſe rules which you propoſe, only except that we will not allow you to be our Judges; if you will come fifteen hundred years after the Apoſtles, a fair time for the pureſt Church to gather much droſs and corruption, and for the <hi>myſterie of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> to bring its work to ſome perfection, which <hi>in the Apoſtles time began to work;</hi> If (I ſay) you will come thus long after, and urge us with the ſingle Tradition of one of theſe Churches, being now Catholique to it ſelf alone, and Heretical to all the reſt: nay not only with her ancient and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Traditions, but alſo with her poſt-nate introduc'd Definitions, and theſe, as we pretend, repugnant to Scripture, and ancient Tradition, and all this to decline an indifferent trial by Scripture, under pretence (wherein alſo you agree with the calumny of the old Heretiques) that <hi>all neceſſary truth cannot be found in them without recourſe to Tradition:</hi> If, I ſay, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe differences, you will ſtill be urging us with this argument, as the very ſame and of the ſame force with that wherewith the fore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Fathers urg'd the old Heretiques: certainly this muſt needs proceed from a confidence you have, not only that we have no School-Divinity, nor Metaphyſicks, but no Logick or common ſenſe; that we are but pictures of men, and have the definition of rational creatures given us in vain.</p>
                        <p n="41">41 But now ſuppoſe I ſhould be liberal to you, and grant what you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove, that the Fathers make Succeſsion a certain and perpetual mark of the true Church; I beſeech you what will come of it? What, that want of Succeſsion is a certain ſign of an Heretical company? Truly if you ſay ſo, either you want Logick, which is a certain ſign of an ill diſputer: or are not pleas'd to uſe it, which is a worſe. For ſpeech is a certain ſign of a living man, yet want of ſpeech is no ſure argument that he is dead: for he may be dumb and yet living ſtill, and we may have other evident tokens that he is ſo, as eating, drinking, breathing, moving: So, though the conſtant and univerſal delivery of any doctrin by the Apoſtolique Churches, ever ſince the Apoſtles, be a very great argument of the truth of it, yet there is no certainty, but that truth, even Divine truth, may, through mens wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, be contracted from its univerſality, and interrupted in its perpetuity, and ſo loſe this argument, and yet not want others to juſtifie and ſupport it ſelf. For it may be one of thoſe principles which God hath written in all mens hearts, or a concluſion evidently ariſing from them: It may be either contain'd in Scripture in expreſs terms, or deducible from it by appar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                           </gap> conſequence. If therefore you intend to prove want of a perpetual Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsion of Profeſſors a certain note of Hereſie, you muſt not content your ſelf to ſhew, that, having it, is one ſign of truth; but you muſt ſhew it to be the only ſign of it and inſeparable from it. But this, if you be well advis'd, you will never undertake; Firſt, becauſe it is an impoſsible attempt: and then becauſe, if you do it, you will marr all: for by proving this an inſeparable ſign of Catholique doctrin, you will prove your own, which apparently wants it in many points, not to be Catholique. For whereas you ſay <hi>this Succeſsion requires two things, agreement with the Apoſtles doctrin, and an uninterrupted conveyance of it down to them that challenge it:</hi> It will be prov'd againſt you, that you fail in both points; and that ſome things wherein you agree with the Apoſtles have not been held alwayes, as, your condemning the Doctrine of the Chiliaſts, and
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:64345:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>holding the Euchariſt not neceſſary for Infants; and that in many other things you agree not with them, nor with the Church for many ages after.

43 <hi>Ad</hi> §. 25. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. The remainder of this Chapter if I would deal ſtrictly with you, I might let paſs as impertinent to the queſtion now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted. For whereas your argument promiſes that this whole Chapter ſhall be imployed in proving <hi>Luther</hi> and the Proteſtants guilty of Hereſie, here you deſert this queſtion, and ſtrike out into another accuſation of them, that <hi>their faith even of the truth they hold, is not indeed true faith.</hi> But put caſe it were not, does it follow, that the having of this faith makes them Heretiques, or that they are therefore Heretiques becauſe they have this faith? <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> believed there were Intelligences which moved the Sphears; he believed this with an humane perſwaſion, and not with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, obſcure, prudent, ſupernatural faith: and will you make <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> an Heretique, becauſe he believed ſo? You believe there was ſuch a man as <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> that there is ſuch a City as <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and your belief hereof has not theſe qualifications which you require to divine faith: And will you be content that this ſhall paſs for a ſufficient proof that you are an Heretique? Hereſie you have defin'd above to be a voluntary error: but he that believes truth, though his belief be not qualified according to your mind, yet ſure in believing truth he believes no error; and from hence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ordinary Logick me-thinks it ſhould follow, that ſuch a man for doing ſo, cannot be guilty of Hereſie.</p>
                        <p n="44">44 But you will ſay, though he be not guilty of Hereſie for believing theſe truths, yet if his faith be not ſaving, to what purpoſe will it be? Truly very little to the purpoſe of Salvation, as little as it is to your proving Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants guilty of Hereſie. But out of our wonted indulgence, let us pardon this fault alſo, and do you the favour to hear what you can ſay, to beget this faith in us, that indeed we have no faith, or at leaſt not ſuch a <hi>faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it is impoſsible to pleaſe God.</hi> Your diſcourſe upon this point, you have, I know not upon what policy, diſ-joynted, and given us the grounds of it in the beginning of the Chapter, and the ſuperſtructure here in the end. Them I have already examined, and for a great part of them, proved them vain and deceitful. I have ſhewed by many certain arguments, that though the ſubject matter of our faith be in it ſelf moſt certain, yet that ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute certainly of adherence, is not required to the eſſence of faith, no nor to make it acceptable with God, but that to both theſe effects it is ſufficient, if it be firm enough to produce Obedience and Charity. I have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that Prudence is rather commendable in faith, than intrinſecal and eſſential to it. So that whatſoever is here ſaid, to prove the faith of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants no faith, for want of certainty or for want of prudence, is already anſwered before it is objected: for the foundation being deſtroyed, the building cannot ſtand. Yet for the fuller refutation of all pretences, I will here make good, that to prove our faith deſtitute of theſe qualifications, you have produc'd but vain Sophiſms, and for the moſt part, ſuch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as return moſt violently upon your ſelves. Thus then you ſay.</p>
                        <p n="45">45 <hi>Firſt, that their belief wanteth certainty, I prove, becauſe they denying the univerſal Infallibility of the Church, can have no certain ground to know what objects are revealed or teſtified by God.</hi> But if there be no other ground of certainty but your Churches infallibility, upon what certain ground do you know that your Church is infallible? Upon what certain ground do you know all thoſe things which muſt be known before you can know that your Church is infallible? As, that there is a God: that God hath
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:64345:180"/>promiſed his aſſiſtance to your Church in all her Decrees: that the Scripture wherein this promiſe is extant, is the word of God: that thoſe texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture which you alledge for your infallibility, are incorrupted: that that which you pretend is the true fenſe of them? When you have produc'd certain grounds for all theſe things, I doubt not but it will appear, that we alſo may have grounds certain enough to believe our whole Religion, which is nothing elſe but the Bible, without dependance on the Churches infallibility. Suppoſe you ſhould meet with a man that, for the preſent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves neither Church, nor Scripture, nor God, but is ready and willing to believe them all, if you can ſhew ſome ſufficient grounds to build his faith upon; will you tell ſuch a man, There are no certain grounds, by which he may be converted; or there are? If you ſay the firſt, you make all Religion an uncertain thing: If the ſecond; then either you muſt ridiculouſly perſwade, that your Church is infallible becauſe it is infallible, or elſe that there are other certain grounds beſides your Churches infallibility.</p>
                        <p n="46">46. But you proced and tell us, that <hi>Holy Scripture is in it ſelf moſt true and infallible, but without the direction and declaration of the Church, we can neither have certain means to know what Scripture is Canonical, nor what Tranſlations be faithful, nor what is the true meaning of Scripture.</hi> Anſw. But all theſe things muſt be known, before we can know the direction of your Church to be infallible, for no other proof of it can be pretended, but only ſome Texts of Canonical Scripture, truly interpreted: Therefore either you are miſtaken, in thinking there is no other means to know theſe things, but your Churches infallible direction; or we are excluded from all means of knowing her direction to be infallible.</p>
                        <p n="47">47 <hi>But Proteſtants, though, as you ſuppoſe, they are perſwaded their own opinions are true, and that they have uſed ſuch means as are wont to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for underſtanding the Scripture, as Prayer, conferring of Texts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet by their diſagreement ſhew, that ſome of them are deceived. Now they hold all the Articles of their faith, upon this only ground of Scripture, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by theſe rules, and therefore it is clear, that the ground of their faith is infallible in no point at all.</hi> The firſt of theſe ſuppoſitions muſt needs be true, but the ſecond is apparently falſe: I mean, that every Proteſtant is perſwaded that he hath uſed thoſe means which are preſcribed for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Scripture. But that which you collect from theſe ſuppoſitions is clearly inconſequent: and by as good Logick you might conclude, that Logick and Geometry ſtand upon no certain grounds, that the rules of the one, and the principles of the other do ſometimes fail, becauſe the diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Logicians and Geometricians ſhew, that ſome of them are deceived. Might not a Jew conclude as well againſt all Chriſtians, that they have no certain ground whereon to rely in their underſtanding of Scripture, becauſe their diſagreements ſhew that ſome are deceived; becauſe ſome deduce from it the infallibility of a Church, and others no ſuch matter. So likewiſe a Turk might uſe the ſame argument againſt both Jews and Chriſtians, and an Atheiſt againſt all Religions, and a Sceptick againſt all Reaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Might not one ſay, Mens diſagreement in Religion, ſhews that there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in any; and the other, that experience of their contradictions teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the rules of reaſon do ſometimes fail? Do not you ſee and feel how void of reaſon and how full of impiety your ſophiſtry is? And how, tranſported with zeal againſt Proteſtants, you urge arguments againſt
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:64345:180"/>them, which if they could not be anſwered, would overthrow not only your owne, but all Religion? But God be thanked, the anſwer is eaſie and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous! For let men but remember not to impute the faults of men but only to men, and then it will eaſily appear, that there may be ſufficient certainty in Reaſon, in Religion, in the rules of interpreting Scripture, though men through their faults, take not care to make uſe of them, and ſo run into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers errors and diſſentions.</p>
                        <p n="48">48. <hi>But Proteſtants cannot determine what points be fundamental, and therefore muſt remain uncertain, whether or no they be not in ſome fundamental error.</hi> Anſw. By like reaſon ſince you acknowledg, that every error in points defin'd and declared by your Church deſtroies the ſubſtance of faith, and yet cannot determine what points be defined, it followeth that you muſt remain uncertain, whether or no you be not in ſome fundamental error, and ſo want the ſubſtance of faith, without which there can be no hope of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now that you are uncertain what points are defined, appears from your own words, c. 4. §. 3. of your ſecond Part, where, ſay you, <hi>No leſs impertinent is your diſcourſe concerning the difficulty to know what is Hereſie: For we grant that it is not alwaies eaſy to determine in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular occaſions, whether this or that Doctrin be ſuch, becauſe it may be doubtful, whether it be againſt any Scripture, or divine Tradition, or definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church.</hi> Neither were it difficult to extort from you this confeſſion, by naming divers Points, which ſome of you ſay are defin'd, others the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And others hang in ſuſpenſe, and know not what to determin. But this I have done elſewhere: as alſo I have ſhewed plainly enough that though we cannot perhaps ſay in particular, Thus much, and no more is fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental, yet believing all the Bible, we are certain enough that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all that is fundamental. As he that, in a Receit, takes twenty ingredients, whereof ten only are neceſſary, though he know not which thoſe ten are, yet taking the whole twenty he is ſure enough that he has taken all that are neceſſary.</p>
                        <p n="49">49. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 29. <hi>But that he who erreth againſt any one revealed truth lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all Divine Faith, is a very true doctrin delivered by Catholique Divines,</hi> (you mean your own) <hi>with ſo general a conſent, that the contrary is wont to be cenſur'd as temerarious: Now certainly ſome Proteſtants muſt do ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they hold contradictions which cannot all be true: Therefore ſome of them at leaſt, have no divine faith.</hi> Anſw. I paſs by your weakneſs, in ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Proteſtants with the authority of your Divines, which yet in you might very deſervedly be cenſur'd. For when D. <hi>Potter,</hi> to ſhew the many actual diſſentions between the Romiſh Doctors, notwithſtanding their braggs of potential Unity, referres to <hi>Pappus,</hi> who has collected out of <hi>Bellar.</hi> their contradictions, and ſet them down in his own words to the number of 237. and to <hi>Flacius, de Sectis &amp; Controverſiis Religionis Papiſticae;</hi> you making the very ſame uſe of M. <hi>Breerely</hi> againſt Proteſtants, yet jeer and ſcorn D. <hi>Potter,</hi> as if he offer'd you for a proof, the bare authority of <hi>Pappus</hi> and <hi>Flacius,</hi> and tell him, which is all the Anſwer you vouchſafe him, <hi>It is pretty that he brings</hi> Pappus <hi>and</hi> Flacius, <hi>flat Heretiques, to prove your many contradictions:</hi> As if he had proved this with the bare authoritie, the bare judgement of theſe men, which ſure he does not, but with the formall words of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> faithfully collected by <hi>Pappus.</hi> And why then might not we ſay to you, Is it not prettie that you bring <hi>Breerely</hi> as flat
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:64345:181"/>an Heretique as <hi>Pappus</hi> or <hi>Flacius,</hi> to prove the contradictions of Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants? Yet had he been ſo vain as to preſs you with the meer authority of Proteſtant Divines in any point, me-thinks, for your own ſake, you ſhould have pardon'd him, who here and in many other places, urge us with the judgement of your Divines as with weighty arguments. Yet if the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of your Divines were even Canonical, certainly nothing could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from it in this matter, there being not one of them, who delivers for true doctrin this Poſition of yours, thus nakedly ſet down, <hi>That any error againſt any one revealed truth deſtroies all divine faith.</hi> For they all require, (not your ſelf excepted) that this truth muſt not only be revealed, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed publiquely, and (all things conſidered) ſufficiently propounded to the erring Party, to be one of thoſe, which God under pain of damnation commands all men to believe. And therefore the contradiction of Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, (though this vain doctrin of your Divines were ſuppoſed true) is but a weak argument<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That any of them have no divine Faith ſeeing you neither have, nor ever can prove, (without begging the Queſtion of your Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es infallibility,) that the truths about which they differ, are of this quality and condition. But though out of courteſie we may ſuppoſe this doctrin true, yet we have no reaſon to grant it, nor to think it any thing but a vain and groundleſs fancie: and that this very weak and inartificial argument, from the authority of your Divines, is the ſtrongeſt pillar which it hath to ſupport it. Two reaſons you alleadge for it out of <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> the firſt whereof vainly ſuppoſeth againſt reaſon and experience, that <hi>by the commiſsion of any deadly ſinne, the habit of Charitie is quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirpated.</hi> And for the ſecond, though you cry it up for an <hi>Achilles,</hi> and think, like the Gorgons head, it will turne us all into ſtone, and in confidence of it, inſult upon Doctor <hi>Potter</hi> as if he durſt not come neare it, yet in very truth having conſidered it well, I finde it a ſerious, grave, prolixe, and profound <hi>nothing.</hi> I could anſwer it in a word, by telling you, that it begges without all proof or colour of proof, the main Queſtion between us, That the infallibilitie of your Church is either the formal motive, or rule, or a neceſſarie condition of faith: which you know we flatly deny, and therefore all that is built upon it has nothing but wind for a foundation. But to this anſwer I will adde a large conſutation of this vain fancie, out of one of the moſt rational and profound Doctors of your own Church, I mean <hi>Eſſius,</hi> who upon the third of the <hi>Sent.</hi> the 23. <hi>diſt.</hi> the 13. §. writes thus, <hi>It is diſputed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whether in him who believes ſome of the Articles of our faith, and disbelieves others, or perhaps ſome one, there be faith properly ſo called in reſpect of that which he does believe? In which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion we muſt before all, carefully diſtinguiſh between thoſe, who retaining a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral readineſs to believe whatſoever the Church believes, yet erre by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in ſome Doctrin of faith, becauſe it is not as yet ſufficiently declared to them that the Church does ſo believe; and thoſe who after ſufficient manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Churches Doctrin, do yet chooſe to diſſent from it, either by doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, or affirming the contrary. For of the former the anſwer is eaſie; but of theſe, that is, of Heretiques retaining ſome part of wholeſome Doctrin, the queſtion is more difficult, and on both ſides by the Doctors probably diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For that there is in them true faith of the Articles wherein they do not erre, firſt experience ſeems to convince: For many at this day denying,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:64345:181"/>for example ſake, Purgatory or Invocation of Saints, nevertheleſs firmly hold, as by divine revelation, that God is Three and One, that the Son of God was incarnate and ſuffered, and other like things. As anciently the Novatians, excepting their peculiar error, of denying reconciliation to thoſe that fell in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, held other things in common with Catholiques: So that they aſsiſted them very much againſt the Arrians, as Socrates relates in his Eccl. Hiſt. Moreover the ſame is proved by the example of the Apoſtles, who in the time of Chriſt's paſsion being ſcandaliz'd, loſt their faith in him: as alſo, Chriſt after his reſurrection upbraids them with their incredulity, and calls Thomas incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, for denying the Reſurrection,</hi> John 20. <hi>Whereupon S.</hi> Auſtin <hi>alſo in his preface upon the</hi> 96 Pſalme <hi>ſaith, That after the Reſurrection of Chriſt, the faith of thoſe that fell was reſtored again. And yet we muſt not ſay, that the Apoſtles then loſt the faith of the Trinity, of the Creation of the world, of Eternal life, and ſuch like other Articles. Beſides, the Jewes before Chriſts comming, held the faith of one God the Creator of Heaven and Earth: who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they loſt the true faith of the Meſsias by not receiving Chriſt; yet we cannot ſay, that they loſt the faith of one God, but ſtill retained this Article as firmely as they did before.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Add hereunto, that neither Jews nor Heretiques ſeem to lye, in ſaying, they believe either the books of the Prophets, or the four Goſpels: it being apparent enough, that they acknowledge in them Divine Authority, though they hold not the true ſenſe of them, to which purpoſe is that in the Acts, chap.</hi> 20. <hi>Believeſt thou the Propheis? I know that thou believeſt. Laſtly, it is manifeſt, that many gifts of God, are found even in bad men, and ſuch as are out of the Church; therefore nothing hinders but that Jews and Heretiques, though they erre in many things, yet in other things may be ſo divinely illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated as to believe aright. So S.</hi> Auſtine <hi>ſeems to teach in his book</hi> De Unico Baptiſmo contra Petilianum <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>in theſe words: When a Jew comes to us to be made a Chriſtian, we deſtroy not in him God's good things, but his own ill. That he believes, One God is to be worſhipped, that he hopes for eternal life, that he doubts not of the Reſurrection we approve and commend him: we acknowledge, that as he did believe theſe things, ſo he is ſtill to believe them; and as he did hold, ſo he is ſtill to hold them. Thus he: ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning more to the ſame purpoſe in the next, and again in the</hi> 26 <hi>Chapter, and in his third Book,</hi> De Bapt. contr. Donat. cap. ult. <hi>and upon</hi> Pſal. 64. <hi>But now this reaſon ſeems to perſwade the contrary: Becauſe the formal object of faith ſeems to be the firſt verity, as it is manifeſted by the Churches Doctrin as the Divine and infallible Rule; wherefore, whoſoever adheres not to this Rule, although he aſſent to ſome matters of faith, yet he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces them not with faith, but with ſome other kind of aſſent: as if a man aſſent to a concluſion, not knowing the reaſon by which it is demonſtrated, he hath not true knowledge, but an opinion only of the ſame concluſion. Now that an Heretique adheres not to the rule aforeſaid, it is manifeſt: Becauſe if he did adhere to it, as divine and infallible, he would receive all without exception, which the Church teacheth, and ſo would not be an Heretique. After this manner diſcourſeth Saint</hi> Thom. 2.2. q. 5. art. 3. <hi>From whom yet</hi> Durand <hi>diſſents upon this diſtinction, thinking there may be in an Heretique true faith, in reſpect of the Article in which he doth not erre. Others, as</hi> Scotus <hi>and</hi> Bonaventure, <hi>define not the matter plainly, but ſeem to chooſe a middle way.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>As for the reaſon alleaged to the contrary, We anſwer: It is impertinent to faith, by what means we believe the prime Verity, that is by what means God uſeth to confer upon men the gift of faith. For although now the ordinary means be the Teſtimony and teaching of the Church, yet it is certain that by other means, faith hath been given heretofore and is given ſtill. For many of the Ancients, as</hi> Adam, Abraham, Melchiſedeck, Job, <hi>received faith by ſpecial revelation; the Apoſtles by the Miracles and preaching of Chriſt; others again by the preaching and miracles of the Apoſtles; And Laſtly others, by other means, when as yet they had heard nothing of the infallibility of the Church. To little Children by Baptiſm, without any other help, faith is infus'd: And therefore it is poſsible, that a man not adhering to the Churches doctrin as a Rule infallible, yet may receive ſome things for the word of God, which do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed truly belong to the faith, either becauſe they are now, or heretofore have been confirm'd by miracles; or becauſe he manifeſtly ſees that the ancient Church taught ſo; or upon ſome other inducement. And yet nevertheleſs we muſt not ſay, that Heretiques and Jewes do hold the Faith, but only ſome part of the Faith. For the Faith ſignifies an entire thing, and compleat in all parts; whereupon an Heretique is ſaid to be ſimply an Infidel, to have loſt the Faith, and, according to the Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. <hi>to have made ſhipwrack of it, although he holds ſome things, with the ſame ſtrength of aſſent and readineſs of will, wherewith by others are held all thoſe points which appertain to the Faith.</hi> And thus farre <hi>Aeſtius.</hi> Whoſe diſcourſe I preſume may paſs for a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent refutation of your argument out of <hi>Aquinas.</hi> And therefore your Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollaries drawn from it, That <hi>every errour aqainſt faith, involves op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition againſt God's teſtimony,</hi> That <hi>Proteſtants have no Faith, no certainty,</hi> And that <hi>you have all Faith,</hi> muſt together with it fall to the ground.</p>
                        <p n="50">50. But, <hi>If Proteſtants have certainty, they want obſcurity, and ſo have not that faith, which as the Apoſtle ſaith is of things not appearing.</hi> This argument you proſecute in the next Paragraph; But I can find nothing in it, to convince or perſwade me that Proteſtants cannot have as much cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty as is required to faith, of an object not ſo evident as to beget ſcience. If obſcurity will not conſiſt with certainty in the higheſt degree, then you are to blame for requiring to faith contradicting conditions. If certainty and obſcurity will ſtand together, what reaſon can be imagin'd that a Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant may not entertain them both as well as a Papiſt? Your bodies and ſouls, your underſtandings and wills are, I think, of the ſame condition with ours: And why then may not we be certain of an obſcure thing as well as you? And as you make this long diſcourſe againſt Proteſtants, why may not we putting Church inſtead of Scripture, ſend it back again to you? And ſay;
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:64345:182"/>
                           <hi>If Papiſts have certainty, they want obſcurity, and ſo have not that faith, which, as the Apoſtle ſaith, is</hi> of things not appearing, <hi>or not neceſsitating our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to an aſſent? For the whole edifice of the faith of Papiſts is ſetled on theſe two principles, Theſe particular propoſitions are the propoſitions of the Church, And the ſenſe and meaning of them is clear and evident, at leaſt in all points neceſſary to ſalvation. Now theſe principles being once ſuppos'd, it clearly followeth, that what Papiſts believe as neceſſary to ſalvation is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently known by them to be true, by this argument; It is certain and evident, that whatſoever is the word of God or Divine Revelation is true; But it is certain and evident that theſe propoſitions of the Church in particular are the word of God and Divine Revelations; Therefore it is certain and evident, that all propoſitions of the Church are true; Which concluſion I take for a Major in a ſecond argument, and ſay thus; It is certain and evident that all propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Church are true; But it is certain and evident, that ſuch particulars, for example, The lawfulneſs of the halfe Communion, The lawfulneſs and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedience of Latine Service, the Doctrin of Tranſubſtantiation, Indulgences, &amp;c. are the Propoſitions of the Church; Therefore it is certain and evident that theſe particular objects are true. Neither will it avail you to ſay, that the ſaid principles are not evident by natural diſcourſe, but only by the eye of reaſon clear'd by grace: For ſupernatural evidence, no leſs (yea rather more) drowns and excludes obſcurity, than natural evidence doth. Neither can the Party ſo enlightned, be ſaid voluntarily to captivate his underſtanding to that light, but rather his underſtanding is by neceſsity made captive and forc'd not to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what is preſented by ſo clear a light. And therefore your imaginary faith is not the true faith defined by the Apoſtle, but an invention of your own.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And having thus cryed quittance with you, I muſt intreat you to deviſe (for truly I cannot) ſome anſwer to this argument, which will not ſerve in proportion to your own. For I hope you will not pretend that I have done you injurie, in ſetling your faith upon principles which you diſclaim. And if you alleadge this diſparitie, That you are more certain of your principles than we of ours, and yet you do not pretend that your principles are ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as we do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>hat ours are: what is this to ſay, but that you are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident than we, but confeſs you have leſs reaſon for it? For the evidence of the thing aſſented to, be it more or leſs, is the reaſon and cauſe of the aſſent in the underſtanding. But then beſides, I am to tell you, that you are here, as every where extreamely, if not affectedly, miſtaken in the doctrin of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; who though they acknowledge, that the things which they believe are in themſelves as certain as any demonſtrable or ſenſible verities, yet pretend not that their certainty of adherence is moſt perfect and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, but ſuch as may be perfected and increas'd as long as they <hi>walk by faith and not by ſight.</hi> And conſonant hereunto is their doctrin touching the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the objects whereunto they adhere. For you abuſe the world and them, if you pretend that they hold the firſt of your two principles, That theſe particular Books are the word of God, (for ſo I think you mean) either to be in it ſelfe evidently certain, or of it ſelf, and being deveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the motives of credibility, evidently credible: For they are not ſo fond as to conceive, nor ſo vain as to pretend, that all men do aſſent to it, which they would if it were evidently certain; nor ſo ridiculous as to imagine, that if an Indian that never heard of Chriſt or Scripture, ſhould by chance find a Bible in his owne Language, and were able to
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:64345:183"/>read it, that upon the reading it, he would certainly without a miracle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to be the word of God: which he could not chuſe if it were evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently credible. What then do they affirm of it? Certainly, no more than this, that whatſoever man that is not of a perverſe minde, ſhall weigh with ſerious and mature deliberation, thoſe great moments of reaſon which may incline him to believe the Divine authority of Scripture, and compare them with the leight objections, that in prudence can be made againſt it, he ſhall not chuſe but finde ſufficient, nay abundant inducements, to yeeld unto it firm faith and ſincere obedience. Let that learned man <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> ſpeak for all the reſt, in his Book <hi>of the truth of Chriſtian Religion;</hi> which Book whoſoever attentively peruſes, ſhall find that a man may have great reaſon to be a Chriſtian without dependance upon your Church for any part of it: and that your Religion is no foundation of, but rather a ſcandal and an objection againſt, Chriſtianity. He then in the laſt Chapter of his ſecond Book hath theſe excellent words, <hi>If any be not ſatisfied with theſe arguments above-ſaid, but deſires more forcible reaſons for confirmation of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Chriſtian Religion, let ſuch know that as there are variety of things which be true, ſo are there divers wayes of proving or manifeſting the truth. Thus is there one way in Mathematicks, another in Phyſicks, a third in Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks, and laſtly another kind when a matter of fact is in queſtion: wherein ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily we muſt reſt content with ſuch teſtimonies as are free from all ſuſpicion of untruth; otherwiſe down goes all the frame and uſe of hiſtory, and a great part of the Art of Phyſick, together with all dutifulneſs that ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween parents and children: for matters of practice can no way elſe be known but by ſuch teſtimonies. Now it is the pleaſure of Almighty God that thoſe things which he would have us to believe (ſo that the very belief thereof may be imputed to us for obedience) ſhould not ſo evidently appear, as thoſe things which are apprehended by ſenſe and plain demonſtration, but only be ſo farre forth revealed as may beget faith, and a perſwaſion thereof, in the hearts and minds of ſuch as are not obſtinate: That ſo the Goſpel may be as a touch-ſtone for triall of mens judgements, whether they be ſound or unſound. For, ſeeing theſe arguments whereof we have ſpoken, have induced ſo many honeſt, godly, and wiſe men to approve of this Religion, it is thereby plain enough that the fault of other mens infidelity is not for want of ſufficient teſtimony, but becauſe they would not have that to be had and embraced for truth, which is contrary to their wilful deſires; it being a hard matter for them to relinquiſh their honors, and ſet at naught other commodities; which thing they know they ought to do, if they admit of Chriſt's doctrin and obey what he hath commanded. And this is the rather to be noted of them, for that many other hiſtorical narrations are approved by them to be true, which notwithſtanding are only manifeſt by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and not by any ſuch ſtrong proofs, and perſwaſions, or tokens, as do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the hiſtory of Chriſt to be true.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="52">52. And now you ſee, I hope, that Proteſtants neither do need nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any ſuch evidence in the doctrin they believe, as cannot well conſiſt both with the eſſence and the obedience of faith. Let us come now to the laſt Nullity which you impute to the faith of Proteſtants, and that is, <hi>want of Prudence.</hi> Touching which point, as I have already demonſtrated, that wiſdome is not eſſential to faith, but that a man may truly believe truth, though upon inſufficient motives; So I doubt not but I ſhall make good, that if prudence were neceſſary to faith, we have better title to it than you;
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:64345:183"/>and that if a wiſer then <hi>Solomon</hi> were here, he ſhould have better reaſon to believe the Religion of Proteſtants than Papiſts, the Bible rather than the Councel of <hi>Trent.</hi> But let us hear what you can ſay!</p>
                        <p n="53">53. <hi>Ad</hi> § 31. You demand then firſt of all, <hi>What wiſdome was it to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake a Church confeſſedly very ancient, and beſides which there could be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated no other Viſible Church of Chriſt upon earth?</hi> I anſwer: Againſt God and truth there lies no Preſcription, and therefore certainly it might be great wiſdome to forſake ancient errors for more ancient Truths. One God is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be follow'd then innumerable worlds of men: And therefore it might be great wiſdome either for the whole Viſible Church, nay for all the men in the world, having wandred from the way of Truth, to return unto it; or for a part of it, nay for one man to do ſo, although all the world beſides were madly reſolute to do the contrary. It might be great wiſdome to forſake the errors though of the only Viſible Church, much more of the <hi>Roman,</hi> which in conceiving her ſelf the whole Viſible Church, does ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like the Frog in the Fable, which thought the ditch he liv'd in, to be all the world.</p>
                        <p n="54">54. You demand again <hi>What wiſdome was it to forſake a Church acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd to want nothing neceſſary to Salvation, indued with Succeſsion of Biſhops, &amp;c. uſque ad Election or Choice?</hi> I anſwer: Yet might it be great wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to forſake a Church not acknowledged to want nothing neceſſary to ſalvation, but accuſed and convicted of Many damnable errors: certainly damnable to them who were convicted of them, had they ſtill perſiſted in them after their conviction; though perhaps pardonable (which is all that is acknowledg'd) to ſuch as ignorantly continued in them. A Church vainly arrogating, without poſſibility of proof, a perpetual Succeſſion of Biſhops, holding alwaies the ſame doctrin; and with a ridiculous impudence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending perpetual poſſeſſion of all the world: whereas the world knowes, that a little before <hi>Luther</hi>'s ariſing, your Church was confined to a part of a part of it. Laſtly a Church vainly glorying in the dependance of other Churches upon her, which yet ſhe ſupports no more than thoſe crouching Anticks which ſeem in great buildings to labour under the weight they bear, do indeed ſupport the Fabrick. For a corrupted and ſalfe Church may give authority to preach the truth, and conſequently againſt her own falſhoods and corruptions. Beſides, a falſe Church may preſerve the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture trure, (as now the old Teſtament is preſerved by the Jewes,) either not being arriv'd to that height of impiety as to attempt the corruption of it, or not able to effect it, or not perceiving, or not regarding the oppoſition of it to her corruptions. And ſo we might receive from you lawful Ordination and true Scriptures, though you were a falſe Church; and receiving the Scriptures from you (though not from you alone,) I hope you cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us, neither need we aske your leave, to believe and obey them. And this, though you be a falſe Church, is enough to make us a true one. As for a <hi>Succeſsion of men that held with us in all points of Doctrin,</hi> it is a thing we need not, and you have as little as we. So that if we acknowledge that your Church before <hi>Luther</hi> was a true Church, it is not for any ends, for any dependance that we have upon you; but becauſe we conceive that in a charitable conſtruction, you may paſs for a true Church. Such a Church (and no better) as you do ſomtimes acknowledge Proteſtants to be, that is, a Company of men, wherein ſome ignorant ſouls may be ſaved. So that
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:64345:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>in this ballancing of Religion againſt Religion, and Church againſt Church, it ſeems you have nothing of weight and moment to put into your ſcale; nothing but ſmoak and wind, vain ſhadows and phantaſtical pretences. Yet if Proteſtants, on the other ſide, had nothing to put in their Scale but thoſe negative commendations which you are pleas'd to afford them; nothing but, No unity, nor means to procure it; no farther extent when <hi>Luther</hi> aroſe than <hi>Luthers</hi> body; no Univerſality of time or place; no Viſibility or being, except only in your Church; no Succeſſion of perſons or doctrin; no leader but <hi>Luther,</hi> in a quarel begun upon no ground but paſſion; no Church, no Ordination, no Scriptures but ſuch as they receiv'd from you; if all this were true, and this were all that could be pleaded for Proteſtants, poſſibly with an allowance of three grains of partiality your Scale might ſeem to turne. But then, if it may appear that part of theſe objections are falſely made againſt them, the reſt vainly; that whatſoever of truth is in theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, is impertinent to this trial, and whatſoever is pertinent is untrue; and beſides, that plenty of good matter may be alleadged for Proteſtants which is here diſſembled: Then, I hope, our cauſe may be good, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe pretences.</p>
                        <p n="55">55. I ſay then that want of Univerſality of time and place, The inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or not exiſtence of the profeſſors of Proteſtant Doctrin before <hi>Luther, Luther</hi>'s being alone when he firſt oppoſed your Church, Our having our Church, Ordination, Scriptures, perſonal and yet not doctrinal Succeſſion from you, are vain and impertinent allegations, againſt the truth of our Doctrin and Church. That the entire truth of Chriſt without any mixture of error ſhould be profeſſed or believed in all places at any time, or in any place at all times, is not a thing evident in reaſon, neither have we any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation for it. And therefore in relying ſo confidently on it, you build your houſe upon the ſand. And what obligation we had either to be ſo peeviſh, as to take nothing of yours, or ſo fooliſh as to take all, I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. For whereas you ſay that <hi>this is to be chooſers and therefore Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,</hi> I tell you that though all Heretiques are chooſers, yet all chooſers are not Heretiques; otherwiſe they alſo, which chooſe your Religion muſt be Heretiques. As for <hi>our wanting Unity and Means of proving it,</hi> Luther<hi>'s oppoſing your Church upon meere paſsion, Our following private men rather than the Catholique Church,</hi> the firſt and laſt are meere untruths, for we want not Unity, nor Means to procure it, in things neceſſary. Plain places of Scripture, and ſuch as need no interpreter, are our means to obtain it. Neither do we follow any private men, but only the Scripture, the word of God as our rule; and reaſon, which is alſo the gift of God, given to direct us in all our actions, in the uſe of this rule. And then for <hi>Luther</hi>'s <hi>oppoſing your Church upon meere paſsion,</hi> it is a thing I will not deny, becauſe I know not his heart, and for the ſame reaſon you ſhould not have affirmed it. Sure I am, whether he oppoſed your Church upon reaſon or no, he had reaſon enough to oppoſe it. And therefore if he did it upon paſſion, we will follow him only in his action and not in his paſſion; in his oppoſition, not in the manner of it; and then I preſume you will have no reaſon to condemne us, unleſs you will ſay that a good action cannot be done with reaſon, becauſe ſome body before us hath done it upon paſſion. You ſee then, how impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent you have been in the choice of your arguments, to prove Proteſtants unwiſe in the choice of their Religion.</p>
                        <p n="56">
                           <pb n="335" facs="tcp:64345:184"/>
56. It remains now, that I ſhould ſhew that many reaſons of moment may be alleaged for the juſtification of Proteſtants, which are diſſembled by you, and not put into the ballance. Know then Sir, that when I ſay, The Religion of Proteſtants, is in prudence to be preferr'd before yours: as, on the one ſide I do not underſtand by your Religion, the doctrin of <hi>Bellarmin</hi> or <hi>Baronius,</hi> or any other private man amongſt you, nor the Doctrin of the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> or of the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> or of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> or of any other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Company among you, but that wherein you all agree, or profeſs to agree, <hi>the Doctrin of the Councel of Trent:</hi> ſo accordingly on the other ſide, by the <hi>Religion of Proteſtants,</hi> I do not underſtand the Doctrin of <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> or <hi>Melancthon;</hi> nor the confeſſion of <hi>Auguſta,</hi> or <hi>Geneva,</hi> nor the Catechiſm of <hi>Heidelberg,</hi> nor the Articles of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> no nor the <hi>Harmony</hi> of Proteſtant Confeſſions; but that wherein they all agree, and which they all ſubſcribe with a greater Harmony, as a perfect rule of their faith and actions, that is, The BIBLE. The BIBLE, I ſay, The BIBLE only, is the Religion of Proteſtants! Whatſoever elſe they believe, beſides It, and the plain, irrefragable, indubitable conſequences of of it, well may they hold it as a matter of Opinion; but as matter of Faith and Religion, neither can they with coherence to their own grounds, believe it themſelves, nor require the belief of it of others, without moſt high and moſt Schiſmatical preſumption. I for my part after a long and (as I verily believe and hope) impartial ſearch of <hi>the true way to eternal hapineſs,</hi> do profeſs plainly that I cannot find any reſt for the ſole of my foot, but upon this Rock only. I ſee plainly and with mine own eyes, that there are Popes againſt Popes, Councels againſt Councels, ſome Fathers againſt others, the ſame Fathers againſt themſelves, a Conſent of Fathers of one age againſt a Conſent of Fathers of another age, the Church of one age againſt the Church of another age. Traditive interpretations of Scripture are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, but there are few or none to be found: No Tradition but only of Scripture, can derive it ſelf from the Fountain, but may be plainly prov'd, either to have been brought in, in ſuch an age after Chriſt; or that in ſuch an age, it was not in. In a word, there is no ſufficient certainty but of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture only, for any conſidering man to build upon. This therefore, and this only I have reaſon to believe: This I will profeſs, according to this I will live, and for this, if there be occaſion, I will not only willingly, but even gladly loſe my life, though I ſhould be ſorry that Chriſtians ſhould take it from me. Propoſe me any thing out of this Book, and require whether I believe or no, and, ſeem it never ſo incomprehenſible to human reaſon, I will ſubſcribe it with hand and heart, as knowing no Demonſtration can bee ſtronger than this, God hath ſaid ſo therefore it is true. In other things, I will take no mans Liberty of judgement from him; neither ſhall any man take mine from me. I will think no man the worſe man, nor the worſe Chriſtian: I will love no man the leſs, for differing in opinion from me. And what meaſure I mete to others, I expect from them again. I am fully aſſured that God does not, and therefore that men ought not to require any more of any man than this, To believe the Scripture to be God's word, to endeavour to find the true ſenſe of it, and to live according to it.</p>
                        <p n="57">57. This is the Religion which I have choſen after a long deliberation, and I am verily perſwaded that I have choſen wiſely, much more wiſely
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:64345:185"/>than if I had guided my ſelf according to your Churches authority. For the Scripture being all true, I am ſecur'd by believing nothing elſe, that I ſhall believe no falſhood as matter of faith. And if I miſtake the ſenſe of Scripture, and ſo fall into error, yet am I ſecure from any danger thereby, if but your grounds be true: becauſe endeavouring to finde the true ſenſe of Scripture, I cannot but hold my error without pertinacy, and be ready to forſake it when a more true and a more probable ſenſe ſhall appear unto me. And then all neceſſary truth being, as I have prov'd, plainly ſet down in Scripture, I am certain by believing Scripture, to believe all neceſſary Truth: And he that does ſo, if his life be anſwerable to his faith, how is it poſſible he ſhould ſaid of Salvation?</p>
                        <p n="58">58. Beſides, whatſoever may be pretended to gain to your Church the credit of a Guide, all that and much more may be ſaid for the Scripture. Hath your Church been ancient? The Scripture is more ancient. Is your Church a means to keep men at unity? So is the Scripture, to keep thoſe that believe it and will obey it, in unity of belief, in matters neceſſary, or very profitable; and in unity of Charity, in points unneceſſary. Is your Church univerſal for time or place? Certainly the Scripture is more univerſal. For all the Chriſtians in the world (thoſe I mean that in truth deſerve this name,) do now, and alwayes have believed the Scripture to be the word of God, ſo much of it at leaſt, as contains all things neceſſary; whereas only you ſay, that you only are the Church of God, and all Chriſtians beſides you deny it.</p>
                        <p n="59">59. Thirdly, following the Scripture, I follow that whereby you prove your Churches infallibility, (whereof were it not for Scripture what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence could you have, or what notion could we have?) and by ſo doing tacitely confeſs, that your ſelves are ſurer of the truth of the Scripture than of your Churches authority. For we muſt be ſurer of the proof than of the thing proved, otherwiſe it is no proof.</p>
                        <p n="60">60, Fourthly, following the Scripture, I follow that which muſt be true if your Church be true: for your Church gives atteſtation to it. Whereas if I follow your Church, I muſt follow that which, though Scripture be true, may be falſe; nay which, if Scripture be true, muſt be falſe, becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teſtifies againſt it.</p>
                        <p n="61">61. Fifthly, to follow the Scripture I have God's expreſs warrant and command, and no colour of any prohibition: But to believe your Church infallible, I have no command at all, much leſs an expreſs command. Nay I have reaſon to fear that I am prohibited to do ſo in theſe words: <hi>Call no man Maſter on earth: They fell by infidelity, Thou ſtandeſt by faith, Be not high minded but fear: The ſpirit of truth the world cannot receive.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="62">62. Following your Church I muſt hold many things not only above reaſon but againſt it; if any thing be againſt it: whereas following the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I ſhall believe many myſteries but no impoſſibilities; many things above reaſon, but nothing againſt it; many things which had they not been reveal'd, reaſon could never have diſcover'd, but nothing which by true reaſon may be confuted: many things which reaſon cannot comprehend how they can be, but nothing which reaſon can comprehend that it cannot be. Nay I ſhall believe nothing which reaſon will not convince that I ought to believe it: For reaſon will convince any man, unleſs he be of a perverſe mind, that the Scripture is the word of God: And then no reaſon can be
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:64345:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>greater than this; God ſayes ſo, therefore it is true.</p>
                        <p n="63">63. Following your Church I muſt hold many things which to any mans judgement, that will give himſelf the liberty of judgement, will ſeem much more plainly contradicted by Scripture, than the infalliblity of your Church appears to be confirm'd by it: and conſequently muſt be ſo fooliſh, as to believe your Church exempted from error, upon leſs evidence, rather than ſubject to the common condition of mankind, upon greater evidence. Now if I take the Scripture only for my Guide, I ſhall not need to do any thing ſo unreaſonable.</p>
                        <p n="64">64. If I will follow your Church I muſt believe impoſſibilities, and that with an abſolute certainty, upon motives which are confeſs'd to be but only <hi>Prudential</hi> and probable: That is with a weak foundation I muſt firmly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a heavy, a monſtrous heavy building: Now following the Scripture I ſhall have no neceſſity to undergoe any ſuch difficulties.</p>
                        <p n="65">65. Following your Church I muſt be ſervant of Chriſt and a ſubject of the King, but only <hi>ad placitum Papae.</hi> I muſt be prepar'd in mind to renounce my allegiance to the King, when the Pope ſhall declare him an Heretique and command me not to obey him: and I muſt be prepar'd in mind <hi>to eſteem Vertue Vice, and Vice Vertue, if the Pope ſhall ſo determine.</hi> Indeed you ſay it is impoſſible he ſhould do the later; but that you know is a great queſtion, neither is it fit my obedience to God and the King ſhould depend upon a queſtionable foundation. And howſoever, you muſt grant that if, by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible ſuppoſition, the Pope's commands ſhould be contrary to the law of Chriſt, that they of your Religion muſt reſolve to obey, rather the commands of the Pope, than the law of Chriſt,. Whereas if I follow the Scripture, I may, nay I muſt, obey my Soveraigne in lawful things, though an Heretique, though a Tyrant; and though, I do not ſay the Pope, but the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nay <hi>an Angel from heaven, ſhould teach any thing againſt the Goſpel of Chriſt, I may, nay I muſt denounce Anathema to him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="66">66. Following the Scripture I ſhall believe a Religion, which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to fleſh and blood, without any aſsiſtance from worldly power, wit, or policy, nay againſt all the power and policy of the world, prevail'd and enlarg'd it ſelf in a very ſhort time all the world over; Whereas it is too too apparent, that your Church hath got and ſtill maintains her authority over mens conſcience, by counterfeiting falſe miracles, forging falſe ſtories, by obtruding on the world ſuppoſititions writings, by corrupting the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of former times, and defacing out of them all which any way makes againſt you, by Warres, by Perſecutions, by Maſſacres, by Treaſons, by Rebellions; in ſhort, by all manner of carnal means whether violent or fraudulent.</p>
                        <p n="67">67. Following the Scripture I ſhall believe a Religion, the firſt preachers and Profeſſors whereof, it is moſt certain, they could have no worldly ends upon the world, that they ſhould not project to themſelves by it any of the profits or honours or pleaſures of this world; but rather were to expect the contrary, even all the miſeries which the world could lay upon them. On the other ſide, the Head of your Church, the pretended Succeſſour of the Apoſtles, and Guide of faith, it is even palpable, that he makes your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion the inſtrument of his ambition, and by it ſeeks to entitle himſelf <hi>directly or indirectly to the Monarchy of the world.</hi> And beſides, it is evident to any man that has but halfe an eye, that moſt of thoſe Doctrins which you add to
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:64345:186"/>the Scripture do make one way or other, for the honour or temporal profit of the Teachers of them.</p>
                        <p n="68">68. Following the Scripture only, I ſhall embrace a Religion of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſimplicity conſiſting in a manner wholly in the worſhip of God in ſpirit and truth. Whereas your Church and Doctrin is even loaded with an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of weak, childiſh, ridiculous, unſavoury Superſtitions and Ceremonies, and full of that <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> for which <hi>Chriſt ſhall judge the world.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="69">69. Following the Scriptures I ſhall believe that which Univerſal, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-failing Tradition aſſures me, that it was by the admitable ſupernatural works of God confirm'd to be the word of God: whereas never any miracle was wrought, never ſo much as a lame horſe cur'd in confirmation of your Churches authority and infallibility. And if any ſtrange things have been done, which may ſeem to give atteſtation to ſome parts of your doctrin, yet this proves nothing but the truth of the Scripture, which foretold that (God's providence permitting it, and the wickedneſs of the world deſerving it) <hi>ſtrange ſignes and wonders ſhould be wrought to confirm falſe doctrin, that they which love not the truth, may be given over to ſtrong deluſions.</hi> Neither does it ſeem to me any ſtrange thing, that God ſhould permit ſome true wonders to be done, to delude them, who have forged ſo many to deceive the world.</p>
                        <p n="70">70. If I follow the Scripture, I muſt not promiſe my ſelf Salvation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effectual dereliction and mortification of all vices, and the effectual prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all Chriſtian Vertues: But your Church opens an eaſier and a broader way to Heaven, and though I continve all my life long in a courſe of ſin, and without the practice of any vertue, yet gives me aſſurance that I may be lett into heaven at a poſtern gate, even by an Act of Attrition at the hour of death, if it be joyn'd with confeſſion, or by an act of Contrition without confeſſion.</p>
                        <p n="71">71. Admirable are the Precepts of piety and humility, of innocence and patience, of liberality, frugality, temperance, ſobriety, juſtice, meekneſs, fortitude, conſtancy and gravity, contempt of the world, love of God and the love of mankind; In a word, of all vertues, and againſt all vice, which the Scriptures impoſe upon us, to be obeyed under pain of damnation: The ſumme whereof is in manner compriz'd in our <hi>Saviours Sermon upon the Mount,</hi> recorded in the 5.6. and 7. of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> which if they were gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obeyed, could not but make the world generally happy, and the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them alone were ſufficient to make any wiſe and good man believe that this Religion rather than any other, came from God the Fountain of all goodneſs. And that they may be generally obeyed our Saviour hath rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them all in the cloſe of his Sermon, with theſe univerſal Sanctions, <hi>Not every one that ſayeth Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdome, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven:</hi> and again, <hi>Whoſoever heareth theſe ſayings of mine and doeth them not, ſhall be likned unto a fooliſh man which built his houſe upon the ſand, and the rain deſcended, and the flood came, and the winds blew, and it fell, and great was the fall thereof.</hi> Now your Church, notwithſtanding all this, enervates and in a manner diſſolves and abrogates many of theſe precepts, teaching men that they are not lawes for all Chriſtians, but Counſels of perfection and matters of Supererogation: that a man ſhall do well if he do obſerve them, but he ſhall not ſin if he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them not; That they are for them who aim at high places in heaven,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:64345:186" rendition="simple:additions"/>who aſpire with the two ſonnes of <hi>Zebede,</hi> to the right hand or to the left hand of Chriſt: But if a man will be content barely to go to heaven, and to be a door-keeper in the houſe of God, eſpecially if he will be content to taſte of Purgatory in the way, he may obtain it at an eaſier purchaſe. Therefore the Religion of your Church is not ſo holy nor ſo good as the Doctrin of Chriſt delivered in Scripture, and therefore not ſo likely to come from the Fountain of holineſs and goodneſs.</p>
                        <p n="72">72. Laſtly, if I follow your Church for my Guide, I ſhall do all one, as if I ſhould follow a Company of blind men in a judgement of colours, or in the choice of a way. For every unconſidering man is blind in that which he does not conſider. Now what is your Church but a company of uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering men, who comfort themſelves, becauſe they are a great company to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but all of them, either out of idleneſs, refuſe the trouble of a fevere tryall of their Religion, (as if heaven were not worth it); or out of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, fear the event of ſuch a tryall, that they may be ſcrupled and ſtagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſquieted by it; and therefore, for the moſt part do it not at all, Or if they do it, they do it negligently, and hypocritically, and perfunctorily, rather for the ſatisfaction of others than themſelves: but certainly without indifference, without liberty of judgement, without a reſolution to doubt of it, if upon examination the grounds of it prove uncertain, or to leave it, if they prove apparently falſe. My own experience aſſures me, that in this imputation I do you no injury: but it is very apparent to all men from your ranking <hi>doubting of any part of your Doctrin,</hi> among mortal ſins. For from hence it followes, that ſeeing every man muſt reſolve that he will never commit mortal ſin, that he muſt never examin the grounds of it at all, for fear he ſhould be mov'd to doubt: or if he do, he muſt reſolve that no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, be they never ſo ſtrong, ſhall move him to doubt, but that with his will and reſolution he will uphold himſelf in a firm beliefe of your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, though his reaſon and his underſtanding fail him. And ſeeing this is the condition of all thoſe whom you eſteem good Catholiques; who can deny, but you are a Company of men unwilling and afraid to underſtand, leſt you ſhould do good! That have eyes to ſee and will not ſee, that <hi>have not the love of truth</hi> (which is only to be known by an indifferent tryall,) and therefore deſerve <hi>to be given over to ſtrong deluſions;</hi> men that love darkneſs more than light: in a word, that you are <hi>the blind leading the blind;</hi> and what prudence, there can be, in following ſuch Guides, our Saviour hath taught us in ſaying, <hi>If the blind lead the blind, both ſhall fall into the ditch.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="73">73. There remains unſpoken to in this Section, ſome places out of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and ſome ſayings of <hi>Luther</hi> wherein he confeſſes that in the Papacy are many good things. But the former I have already conſidered, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd the argument grounded on them. As for <hi>Luther</hi>'s ſpeeches, I told you, not long ſince, that we follow no private men, and regard not much what he ſaies either againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or for it, but what he proves. He was a man of a vehement ſpirit, and very often what he took in hand, he did not do it but over-do it. He that will juſtifie all his ſpeeches, eſpecially ſuch as he wrote in heat of oppoſition, I believe will have work enough. Yet in theſe ſentences, though he over-reach in the particulars, yet what he ſaies in general we confeſs true, and confeſs with him <hi>that in the Papacy are many good things,</hi> which have come from them to us; but withal
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:64345:187"/>we ſay there are many bad, neither do we think our ſelves bound in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence either to reject the good with the bad, or to retain the bad with the good, but rather conceive it a high point of wiſdome, to ſeparate between the <hi>pretious and the vile, to ſever the good from the bad, and to put the good in veſſels to be kept, and to caſt the bad away; to try all things, and to hold that which is good.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="74">74. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 32. Your next and laſt argument againſt the faith of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants is, becauſe <hi>wanting Certainty and Prudence, it muſt alſo want the fourth condition, Supernaturality. For that being a humane perſwaſion, it is not in the eſſence of it ſupernatural: and being imprudent and raſh, it cannot proceed from Divine motion, and ſo is not ſupernatural in reſpect of the cauſe from which it proceedeth.</hi> Anſ. This little diſcourſe ſtands wholly upon what went before, and therefore muſt fall together with it. I have proved the Faith of Proteſtants as certain, and as prudent as the faith of Papiſts; and therefore if theſe be certain grounds of ſupernaturality, our faith may have it as well as yours. I would here furthermore be inform'd how you can aſſure us that your faith is not your perſwaſion or opinion (for you make them all one) that your Churches Doctrin is true? Or if you grant it your perſwaſion, why is it not the perſwaſion of men, and, in reſpect of the ſubject of it, an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane perſwaſion? I deſire alſo to know, what ſenſe there is in pretending that your perſwaſion is, not in regard of the object only and cauſe of it, but in the nature or eſſence of it, ſupernatural? Laſtly, whereas you ſay, that <hi>being imprudent it cannot come from divine motion:</hi> certainly by this reaſon all they that believe your own Religion, and cannot give a wiſe and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reaſon for it, (as millions amongſt you cannot) muſt be condemn'd to have no ſupernatural faith: or if not, then without queſtion nothing can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but that the imprudent faith of Proteſtants may proceed from divine motion, as well as the imprudent faith of Papiſts.</p>
                        <p n="75">75. And thus having weighed your whole diſcourſe, and found it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lighter than vanity, why ſhould I not invert your concluſion, and ſay, Seeing you have not proved that whoſoever errs againſt any one point of Faith loſeth all divine Faith: nor that any error whatſoever concerning that which by the Parties litigant may be eſteem'd a matter of faith, is a grievous ſin, it follows not at all, that when two men hold different doctrins concerning Religion, that but one can be ſaved? Not that I deny, but that the ſentence of Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> with which you conclude this Chapter may in a good ſenſe, be true: for oftimes by <hi>the faith</hi> is meant only that Doctrin which is <hi>neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> and to ſay that ſalvation may be had without any the leaſt thing wich is neceſſary to ſalvation, implyes a repugnance and deſtroys it ſelf. Beſides, not to believe all neceſſary points, and to believe none at all, is for the purpoſe of ſalvation, all one; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that does ſo, may juſtly be ſaid to deſtroy the Goſpel of Chriſt, ſeeing he makes it uneffectual to the end for which it was intended, the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of mens ſoules. But why you ſhould conceive that all differences about Religion are concerning matters of faith, in this high notion of the word, for that I conceive no reaſon.</p>

                        <hi>Charity in me.</hi> The reaſon whereof is, becauſe the infinite Goodneſs of God, which is the <hi>formal object,</hi> or Motive of <hi>Charity,</hi> and for which all other things are loved, is differently participated by different Objects; and therefore the love we bear to them for Gods ſake, muſt accordingly be unequal. In the vertue of <hi>Faith,</hi> the caſe is far otherwiſe; becauſe all the Objects, or points which we believe, do equally participate the divine Teſtimony or Revelation, for which we believe alike all things propounded for ſuch. For it is as impoſſible for God, to ſpeak an untruth in a ſmall, as in a great matter. And this is the ground for which we have ſo often affirmed, that any leaſt error againſt <hi>Faith,</hi> is in jurious to God and deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive of Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. This order in Charity may be conſidered; Towards God; Our own ſoul; The ſoul of our Neighbour; Our own life, or goods; and the life or goods of our Nighbour. God is to be beloved above all things, both <hi>Objectivè</hi> (as the Divines ſpeak) that is, we muſt with or deſire to God, a good more great, perfect and noble than to any, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the other Objects of Charity, of which I ſpake, this order is to be kept. We may but are not bound, to preferre the life and goods of Neighbour before our own: we are bound to preferre the ſoul of our Neighbour before our own temporal goods or life, if he happen to be in extreme ſpiritual neceſſity, and that we by our aſſiſtance can ſuccour him, according to the ſaying of Saint <hi>John: In this we have known</hi>
                        <note n="(b)" place="margin">1. <hi>Joan.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 16.</note>

                        <hi>to loſe his own temporal life, for the eternal life of his Neighbour.</hi> Laſtly we are to preferre the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> good of our own ſoule, before both the ſpiritual and temporal good of our Neighbour, becauſe as Charity doth of its own Nature, chiefly encline the perſon in whom it reſides, to love God, and to be united with him: ſo of it ſelf it enclines him to procure thoſe things whereby the ſaid Union with God is effected, rather to himſelf then to others. And from hence it follows, that in things neceſſary to ſalvation, no man ought in any caſe, or in any reſpect whatſoever, to preferre the ſpiritual good, either of any particular perſon, or of the whole world before his own ſoul; according to thoſe words of our Bleſſed Saviour: <hi>What doth it</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. Now of things neceſſary to ſalvation, there are two ſorts, according to the doctrin of all Divines. Somethings (ſay they) are neceſſary to ſalvation, <hi>neceſſitate praecepti,</hi> neceſſary only becauſe they are commanded; For, <hi>If thou wilt</hi>
                        <note n="(e)" place="margin">Matth. 19.17.</note> 
                        <hi>enter into life, keepe the Commandements.</hi> In which kind of things, as probable ignorance of the Law, or of the commandement, doth excuſe the party from all faulty breach thereof; ſo likewiſe doth it not exclude ſalvation in caſe of ignorance. Some other things are ſaid to be neceſſary to ſalvation <hi>neceſſitate medii, finis,</hi> or <hi>ſalutis;</hi> becauſe they are Means appointed by God to attain our <hi>End</hi> of eternal <hi>ſalvation,</hi> in ſo ſtrict a manner, that it were <hi>Preſumption</hi> to <hi>hope</hi> for Salvation without them. And as the former means are ſaid to be <hi>neceſſary,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>commanded;</hi> ſo the latter are commonly ſaid to be <hi>commanded,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>neceſſary,</hi> that is: Although there were no other ſpecial precept concerning them; yet ſuppoſing they be once appointed as means abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to ſalvation, there cannot but ariſe an obligation of procuring to have them, in vertue of that univerſal precept of Charity, which obligeth every man to procure the ſalvation of his own ſoul. In this ſort <hi>divine infallible Faith</hi> is neceſſary to ſalvation; as likewiſe Repentance of every deadly ſin, and in the doctrin of Catholiques, Baptiſm <hi>in re,</hi> that is, in <hi>Act,</hi> to Children, and for thoſe who are come to the uſe of reaſon, <hi>in voto,</hi> or <hi>hearty deſire,</hi> when they cannot have it in act. And as Baptiſm is neceſſary for remiſſion of <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Actual</hi> ſin committed before it; ſo the Sacrament of <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> or pennance is neceſſary <hi>in re</hi> or <hi>in voto,</hi> in <hi>act</hi> or <hi>deſire,</hi> for the remiſſion of mortal ſins, committed after Baptiſm. The miniſter of which Sacrament of Pennance being neceſſarily a true Prieſt, true Ordination is neceſſary in the Church of God for remiſſion of ſins by this Sacrament, as alſo for other ends not belonging to our preſent purpoſe. From hence it riſeth, that no ignorance or impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility can ſupply the want of thoſe means which are abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation. As if, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, a ſinner depart this world without repenting himſelf of all deadly ſins, although he die ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, or unexpectedly fall out of his wits, and ſo commit no new ſin by omiſſion of repentance; yet he ſhall be eternally puniſhed for his former ſins committed, and never repented of. If an Infant die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baptiſm, he cannot be ſaved; not by reaſon of any actuall ſin committed by him in omitting Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:64345:188"/>but for Original ſin, not forgiven, by the means which God hath ordained to that purpoſe. Which doctrin, all, or moſt Proteſtants will (for ought I know) grant to be true, in the Children of Infidels; yea not only <hi>Lutherans,</hi> but alſo ſome other Proteſtants, as M. <hi>Bilſon</hi> late of <hi>Wincheſter</hi>

Part.</hi> 4. <hi>pag</hi> 168. <hi>&amp;</hi> 369.</note> and others, hold it to be true, even in the Children of the faithful. And if Proteſtants in general diſagree from Catholiques in this point, it cannot be denyed but that our diſagreement is in a point very <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental.</hi> And the like I ſay of the Sacrament of Pennance, which they deny to be neceſſary to ſalvation, either in act or in deſire; which error is likewiſe fundamental, becauſe it concerns (as I ſaid) a thing neceſſary to ſalvation: And for the ſame reaſon, if their Prieſthood and Ordination be doubtful, as certainly it is, they are in danger to want a means without which they cannot be ſaved. Neither ought this rigour to ſeem ſtrange, or unjuſt: For almighty God having, of his own <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> without our <hi>merit,</hi> firſt ordained man to a <hi>ſupernatural</hi> end of eternal felicity; and then, after our fall in <hi>Adam</hi> vouchſafed to reduce us to the attaining of that End, if his bleſſed <hi>Will</hi> be pleaſed to limit the attaining of that End, to ſome means which in his infinite Wiſdome he thinks moſt fit; who can ſay, Why doſt thou ſo? Or who can <hi>hope</hi> for that <hi>End,</hi> without ſuch <hi>means?</hi> Bleſſed be his divine Majeſty, for vouchſafing to ordain us, baſe creatures, to ſo ſublime an End, by any means at all!</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Out of the foreſaid difference followeth another, that (generally ſpeaking) in things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary only becauſe they are commanded, it is ſufficient for avoiding ſin, that we proceed prudently, and by the conduct of ſome probable opinion, maturely weighed and approved by men of vertue, learning and wiſdome. Neither are we alwayes obliged to follow the moſt ſtrict, and ſevere, or ſecure part, as long as the doctrin which we embrace, proceeds upon ſuch reaſons, as may warrant it to be truly probable, and prudent, though the contrary part want not alſo probable grounds. For in humane affairs and diſcourſe, evidence and certainty cannot be alwayes expected. But when we treat not preciſely of avoiding ſin, but moreover of procuring ſome thing without which I cannot ſaved; I am obliged by the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi> to procure as great certainty as morally I am able, and am not to follow every probable opinion or dictamen, but <hi>tutiorem partem, the ſafer part,</hi> becauſe, if my <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability</hi> prove falſe, I ſhall not <hi>probably</hi> but <hi>certainly</hi> come ſhort of Salvation. Nay in ſuch caſe, I ſhall incurre a new ſin againſt the <hi>Vertue</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> towards my <hi>ſelf,</hi> which obligeth every one not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his ſoul to the hazard of eternal perdition, when it is in his power, with the aſſiſtance of Gods grace, to make the matter ſure. From this very ground it is, that although ſome Divines be of opinion, that it is not a ſin to uſe ſome. <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Form</hi> of Sacraments, only probable, if we reſpect preciſely the reverence or reſpect which is due to Sacraments, as they belong to the <hi>Moral infuſed</hi> Vertue of <hi>Religion;</hi> yet when they are ſuch Sacraments, as the invalidity thereof may endanger the ſalvation of ſouls, all do with one conſent agree, that it is a grievous offence to uſe a doubtful, or only probable <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Form,</hi> when it is in our power to procure certainty. If therefore it may appear, that though it were not certain that Proteſtancy unrepented deſtroyes Salvation (as we have proved to be very certain) yet at leaſt that it is <hi>probable,</hi> and withal, that there is a way more ſafe; it will follow out of the grounds already laid, that they are obliged by the law of Charity to embrace that ſafe way.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Now that Proteſtants have reaſon, at leaſt to doubt in what caſe they ſtand, is deduced from what we have ſaid, and proved about the univerſal infallibility of the Church, and of her being Judge of Controverſies, to whom all Chriſtians ought to ſubmit their Judgement (as even ſome Proteſtants grant,) and whom to oppoſe in any one of her definitions, is a grievous ſin: As alſo from what we have ſaid of the <hi>Unity, Univerſality</hi> and <hi>Viſibility</hi> of the Church, and of Succeſſion of Perſons, and Doctrin; Of the conditions of Divine Faith, <hi>Certainty, Obſcurity, Prudence,</hi> and <hi>Supernaturality,</hi> which are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the faith of Proteſtants; Of the frivolous diſtinction of points fundamental and not fundamental, (the confutation whereof proveth that <hi>Heretiques</hi> diſagreeing among themſelves in any leaſt point, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the ſame faith, nor be of the ſame Church:) Of Schiſm; of Hereſie; of the Perſons who firſt revolted from <hi>Rome,</hi> and of their Motives; of the Nature of Faith, which is deſtroyed by any leaſt error, and it is certain that ſome of them muſt be in error and want the ſubſtance of true faith; and ſince all pretend the like certainty, it is cleer that none of them have any certainty at all, but that they want true faith which is a means <hi>moſt abſolutely neceſſary</hi> to Salvation. Moreover, as I ſaid heretofore, ſince it is granted that every Error in fundamentall points is damnable, and that they cannot tell in particular, what points be fundamental, it followes that none of them knowes whether he, or his Brethren, do not erre damnably, it being certain that amongſt ſo many diſagreeing Perſons ſome muſt erre. Upon the ſame ground of not being able to aſſigne what points be fundamental, I ſay they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſure whether the difference among them be fundamental or no, and conſequently whether they agree in the ſubſtance of faith and hope of Salvation. I omit to adde that you want the Sacrament of Penance, inſtituted for remiſſion of ſins, or at leaſt you muſt confeſs that you hold it not neceſſary; and yet your own Bretheren, for example the <hi>Century-Writers</hi> do<note n="(g)" place="margin">

On the other ſide, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is the ſafer way to Heaven (not to repeat what hath been already ſaid upon divers occaſions) I will again put you in mind, that unleſs the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was the true Church there was no viſible true Church upon earth. A thing ſo manifeſt, that Proteſtants themſelves confeſs that more than one thouſand yeers the <hi>Roman</hi> Church poſſeſſed the whole world, as we have ſhewed heretofore, out of their own<note n="(h)" place="margin">

And here I wiſh you to conſider with fear and trembling, how all <hi>Roman</hi> Catholiques, not one excepted; that is, thoſe very men whom you muſt hold not to erre damnably in their belief, unleſs you will deſtroy your own Church, and ſalvation; do with una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous conſent believe, and profeſs that Proteſtancy unrepented deſtroyes Salvation; and then tell me,

And therefore the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> could not make the like argument agains Catholiques, as Catholiques make againſt you, who grant us ſalvation, which we deny to you. But at leaſt (you will ſay) this Argument for the Certainty of their Baptiſm, was like to Ours touching the Security and Certainty of our Salvation; and therefore that Catholiques ſhould have eſteemed the Baptiſm of the Donatiſts more certain than their own, and ſo have allowed Rebaptization of ſuch as were baptized by Heretiques, or ſinners, as the Donatiſts eſteemed all Catholiques to be. I anſwer, No. Becauſe it being a matter of faith, that Baptiſm ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by Heretiques, obſerving due Matter, Forme, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is valid: to rebaptize any ſo baptized, had been both a ſacriledge in reiterating a Sacrament not reiterable, and a profeſſion alſo of a damnable Hereſy, and therefore had not been more <hi>ſafe,</hi> but certainly <hi>damnable.</hi> But you confeſs that in the doctrin or practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, there is no belief, or profeſſion of any damnable error, which if there were, even your Church ſhould certainly be no Church. To believe therefore and profeſs as we do, cannot exclude Salvation, as Rebaptization muſt have done. But if the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> could have affirmed with truth, that, in the opinion both of Catholiques and themſelves, their Baptiſm was good, yea and good in ſuch ſort as that unleſs theirs was good, that of the Catholiques could not be ſuch: but theirs might be good, though that of the Catholiques were not: and further, that it was no damnable error to believe, that Baptiſm adminiſtred by the Catholiques was not good, nor that it was any Sacriledge to reiterate the ſame Baptiſm of Catholiques: If, I ſay, they could have truly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed theſe things, they had ſaid ſomewhat, which at leaſt had ſeemed to the purpoſe. But theſe things they could not ſay with any colour of truth, and therefore their argument was fond, and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.

For the true Theological <hi>Hope</hi> of Chriſtians, is a <hi>Hope</hi> which keeps a mean between <hi>Preſumption,</hi> and <hi>Deſperation;</hi> which moves us to work our ſalvation with fear and trembling; which conducts us to make ſure our ſalvation by good works, as holy Scripture adviſeth: But, contrarily, Proteſtants do either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Hope</hi> by <hi>Deſpair,</hi> with the Doctrin, That our Saviour died not for all, and, that ſuch want grace ſufficient to ſalvation; or elſe by vain <hi>Preſumption,</hi> grounded upon a fantaſtical perſwaſion, that they are Predeſtinate; which Faith muſt exclude all fear, and trembling. Neither can they make their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>certain by good works,</hi> who do certainly believe, that before any good works they are juſtified, and juſtified even by Faith alone, and by that Faith whereby they certainly believe they are juſtified.

And if ſome Proteſtants do now relent from the rigour of the foreſaid doctrin, we muſt affirm, that at leaſt ſome of them want the Theological Vertue of <hi>Hope;</hi> yea that none of them can have true <hi>Hope,</hi> while they hope to be ſaved in the Communion of thoſe, who defend ſuch doctrins, as do directly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw all true Chriſtian <hi>Hope.</hi> And for as much as concerns <hi>Faith,</hi> we muſt alſo inferr, that they want <hi>Unity</hi> therein (and conſequently have none at all) by their diſagreement about <hi>the ſoul of the Church; the principal Origin of ſalvation, of all other points of Doctrin the chiefeſt and weightieſt.</hi> And if you want true <hi>Faith,</hi> you muſt by conſequence want <hi>Hope;</hi> or if you hold that this <hi>point</hi> is not to be ſo indiviſible on either ſide, but that it hath latitude ſufficient to imbrace all parties, without prejudice to their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; notwithſtanding that your Brethren hold it to be <hi>the ſoul of the Church,</hi> &amp;c.

It was needleſs to prove, that due Order is to be obſerved in anything; much more in Charity, which being one of the beſt things, may be ſpoil'd by being diſordered!

For by this rule, no man ſhould love himſelf more than all the world; which yet you require, unleſs he were firſt vainly perſwaded that he doth more participate the Divine Goodneſs than all the world. But the true reaſon why one thing ought to be lov'd more then another, is, becauſe one thing is better then another, or becauſe it is better to us, or becauſe God commands us to do ſo, or becauſe God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf does ſo, and we are to conform our affections to the will of God.</item>

And therefore, Rejoycing only and not <hi>Welwiſhing</hi> is here the proper worke of love.</item>
                              <item>2. Whereas you ſay, That <hi>in things neceſſary to ſalvation, no man ought in any caſe or in any reſpect whatſoever, to prefer the ſpiritual good of the whole world before his own ſoul:</hi> In ſaying this, you ſeem to me to condemn one of the greateſt acts of Charity, of one of the greateſt Saints that ever was, I mean S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who <hi>for his bretheren deſir'd to be an Anathema from Chriſt.</hi> And as for the Text al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged by you in confirmation of your ſaying, <hi>What doth it avail a man if he gain the whole world, and ſuſtain the damage of his own ſoul!</hi> It is nothing to the purpoſe: For without all queſtion, it is not profitable for a man to do ſo; but the queſtion is, whether it be not lawful for a man to forgo and part with his own particular profit, to procure the univerſal, ſpiritual, and eternal benefit of others?</item>
                              <item>3. Whereas you ſay, <hi>It is directly againſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to our ſelves, to adventure the omitting of any means neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> this is true: But ſo is this alſo, that it is directly againſt the ſame Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to adventure the omitting any thing, that may any way help or conduce to my ſalvation, that may make the way to it more ſecure or leſs dangerous. And therefore if the errors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church do but hinder me in this way, or any way endanger it, I am, in Charity to my ſelf, bound to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, though they be not deſtructive of it.</item>

But the ſuppoſition is certainly falſe.

                           <hi>Ad</hi> §. 3. I proceed now to the <hi>third Section;</hi> and herein firſt I obſerve this acknowledgement of yours, <hi>That in things neceſſary only becauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, a probable ignorance of the commandement excuſes the Party from all fault, and doth not exclude Salvation.</hi> From which Doctrin it ſeems to me to follow, that ſeeing obedience to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church cannot be pretended to be neceſſary, but only becauſe it is commanded, therefore not only an invincible, but even a probable ignorance of this pretended command, muſt excuſe us from all faulty breach of it, and cannot exclude Salvation. Now ſeeing this command is not pretended to be expreſly delivered, but only to be deduced from the word of God, and that not by the moſt cleer and evident conſequences that may be; and ſeeing an infinity of great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections lies againſt it, which ſeem ſtrongly to prove that that is no ſuch command, with what Charity can you ſuppoſe, that our ignorance of this command, is not at the leaſt probable, if not, all things conſidered, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invincible? Sure I am, for my part, that I have done my true endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to finde it true, and am ſtill willing to do ſo; but the more I ſeek, the farther I am from finding, and therefore if it be true, certainly my not finding it is very excuſable, and you have reaſon to be very charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in your cenſures of me. 2. Whereas you ſay, that <hi>beſides theſe things neceſſary becauſe commanded, there are other things, which are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed becauſe neceſſary: of which number you make Divine infallible faith, Baptiſm in act for Children, and in Deſire for thoſe who are come to the uſe of Reaſon, and the Sacrament of Confeſsion for thoſe who have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mortal ſin:</hi> In theſe words you ſeem to me to deliver a ſtrange Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe, <hi>viz.</hi> That Faith, and Baptiſm, and Confeſſion, are not therefore neceſſary for us, becauſe God appointed them, but are therefore appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, becauſe they were neceſſary for us, antecedently to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. which if it were true, I wonder what it was beſide God that made them neceſſary, and made it neceſſary for God to command them! Beſides, in making Faith one of theſe neceſſary means, you ſeem to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude Infants from Salvation: For, <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> and they have not heard. In requiring that this Faith ſhould be <hi>divine and infallible,</hi> you caſt your Credence into infinite perplexity, who cannot poſſibly by any ſure Mark diſcern whether their Faith be Divine or humane; or if you have any certain ſigne, whereby they may diſcern whether they believe your Churches infallibility with Divine or only with humane faith, I pray produce it, for perhaps it may ſerve us to ſhew, that our faith is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine as well as yours. Moreover, in affirming that <hi>Baptiſm in act is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Infants, and for men only in deſire,</hi> You ſeem to me in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to deſtroy the foundation of the former. For if a deſire of Baptiſm will ſerve men in ſtead of Baptiſm, then thoſe words of our Saviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>Unleſs a man be born again of water,</hi> &amp;c. are not to be underſtood lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and rigidly of external Baptiſm; for a deſire of Baptiſm is not Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and ſo your foundation of the abſolute neceſſity of Baptiſm is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. And if you may gloſs the Text ſo far, as that men may be ſaved by the deſire, without Baptiſm it ſelf, becauſe they cannot have, it, Why ſhould you not gloſs it a litle farther, that there may be ſome hope of the ſalvation of unbaptized infants: to whom it was more impoſſible to have a
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:64345:191"/>deſire of Baptiſm, than for the former to have the thing it ſelf? Laſtly, for your <hi>Sacrament of Confeſsion,</hi> we know none ſuch, nor any ſuch abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſsity of it. They that confeſs their ſins and forſake them ſhall find mercy, though they confeſs them to God only and not to men. They that confeſs them both to God and men, if they do not effectually and in time forſake them, ſhall not find mercy, 3. Whereas you fay, that <hi>ſuppoſing theſe means once appointed as abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, there cannot but ariſe an obligation of procuring to have them;</hi> you muſt ſuppoſe, I hope, that we know them to be ſo appointed, and that it is in our power to procure them: otherwiſe though it may be our ill fortune to fail of the end, for want of the means, certainly we cannot be obliged to procure them. For the rule of the Law is alſo the dictate of common reaſon and equity, That <hi>no man can be obliged to what is impoſsible.</hi> We can be obliged to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but by vertue of ſome command: now it is impoſsible that God ſhould command in earneſt any thing which he knows to be impoſsible. For to command in earneſt, is to command with an intent to be obeyed which is not poſsible he ſhould do, when he knows the thing commanded to be impoſsible. Laſtly, whoſoever is obliged to do any thing, and does it not, commits a fault; but Infants commit no fault in not procuring to have Baptiſm; therefore no obligation lies upon them to procure it. 4. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you ſay, that <hi>if Proteſtants diſſent from you in the point of the neceſsity of Baptiſm for infants, it cannot be denyed but that our diſagreement it in a point fundamental;</hi> If you mean a point eſteemed ſo by you, this indeed cannot be denyed: But if you mean a point that indeed is fundamental, this may certainly be denyed: for I deny it, and ſay, that it doth not appear to me any way neceſſary to Salvation to hold the truth, or not to hold an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, touching the condition of theſe Infants. This is certain, and we muſt believe that God will not deal unjuſtly with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but how in particular he will deal with them concernes not us, and therefore we need not much regard it. 5. Whereas you ſay the like of your <hi>Sacrament of Penance,</hi> you only ſay ſo, but your proofs are wanting. Laſtly, whereas you ſay, <hi>This ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour ought not to ſeem ſtrange or unjuſt in God, but that we are rather to bleſs him for ordaining us to Salvation by any means:</hi> I anſwer, that it is true, we are not to queſtion the known will of God, of injuſtice; yet whether that which you pretend to be Gods will be ſo indeed, or only your preſumption, this I hope may be queſtion'd lawfully and without preſumption; and if we have occaſion we may ſafely put you in mind of <hi>Ezechiel</hi>'s commination, againſt all thoſe who ſay, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> when they have no certain warrant or authority from him to do ſo.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 4. In the <hi>fourth Paragraph,</hi> you deliver this falſe and wicked Doctrin, <hi>that for the procuring our own ſalvation we are alwaies boundunder pain of mortal ſin, to take the ſafeſt way; but for avoyding ſin we are not bound to do ſo, but may follow the opinion of any probable Doctors,</hi> though the contrary way be certainly free from ſin, and theirs be doubtfull. Which doctrin in the former part of it, is apparently falſe. For though wiſdom and Charity to our ſelves would perſwade us alwaies to do ſo, yet many times, that way which to our ſelves and our ſalvation is more full of hazard, is notwithſtanding not only lawful but more charitable and more noble. For example, to fly from a perſecution and ſo to avoid the temptation of it, may be the ſafer way for a mans own ſalvation; yet I
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:64345:191"/>preſume no man ought to condemn him of impiety, who ſhould reſolve not to uſe his liberty in this matter, but for Gods greater glory, the greater honour of truth, and the greater confirmation of his bretheren in the faith, chooſe to ſtand out the ſtorm and endure the fiery trial, rather than avoid it; rather to put his own ſoul to the hazard of a temptation, in hope of Gods aſſiſtance to go through with it, than to baulk the opportunity of doing God and his bretheren ſo great a ſervice. This part therefore of this Doctrin is manifeſtly untrue. The other, not only falſe but impious; for therein you plainly give us to underſtand, that in your judgement, a reſolution to avoid ſin, to the uttermoſt of your power, is no neceſſary means of Salvation; nay that a man may reſolve not to do ſo, without any danger of damnation. Therein you teach us that we are to do more for the love of our ſelves, and our own happineſs, than for the love of God; and in ſo doing contradict our Saviour, who expreſly commands us, <hi>to love the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our ſoul, and with all our ſtrength;</hi> and hath taught us, <hi>that the love of God conſiſts in avoiding ſin and keeping his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</hi> Therein you directly croſs S. <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrin, who though he were a very probable Doctor, and had delivered his judgement for the <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of eating meats offered to Idols;</hi> yet he aſſures us that he which ſhould make ſcruple of doing ſo, and forbear upon his ſcruple, ſhould not ſin, but only be <hi>a weak brother;</hi> whereas he, who ſhould do it with a doubtful conſcience, (though the action were by S. <hi>Paul</hi> warranted lawful, yet) <hi>ſheuld ſin and be condemn'd for ſo doing.</hi> You pretend indeed to be rigid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders and ſtout champions for the neceſſity of good works; but the truth is, <hi>you ſpeak lies in hypocriſie,</hi> and, when the matter is well examin'd, will appear to make your ſelves and your own functions neceſſary, but obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God unneceſſary: Which will appear to any man who conſiders what ſtrict neceſſity the Scripture impoſes upon all men, of effectual morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the habits of all vices, and effectual converſion to newneſs of life, and univerſal obedience, and withal remembers that an act of Attrition, which you ſay with Prieſtly Abſolution is ſufficient to ſalvation, is not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, which being a work of difficulty and time, cannot be perform'd in an inſtant. But for the preſent, it appears ſufficiently our of this impious aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, which makes it abſolutely neceſſary for men, either in Act, if it be poſsible, or if not, in Deſire, to be Baptiz'd and Abſolv'd by you, and that with intention: and in the mean time warrants them that for avoiding of ſin, they may ſafely follow the uncertain guidance of vain man, who you cannot deny may either be deceiv'd himſelf, or out of malice deceive them, and neglect the certain direction of God himſelf, and their own conſciences. What wicked uſe is made of this Doctrin, your own long experience can better inform you, than it is poſsible for me to do: yet my own little conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with you affoords one memorable example to this purpoſe. For upon this ground I knew a young Schollar in <hi>Doway,</hi> licenc'd by a great Caſuiſt to ſwear a thing as upon his certain knowledge, whereof he had yet no knowledge but only a great preſumption, <hi>becauſe</hi> (forſooth) <hi>it was the opinion of one Doctor that he might do ſo.</hi> And upon the ſame ground, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you ſhall come to have a prevailing party in this Kingdome, and power ſufficient to reſtore your Religion, you may do it by depoſing or killing the King, by blowing up of Parliaments, and by rooting out all others of a different faith from you.

                           <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> a man with you of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved vertue, learning, and judgement, hath declared his opinion for the lawfulneſs of it in ſaying, that <hi>want of power to maintain a rebellion, was the only reaſon that the primitive Chriſtians did not rebel againſt their perſecuting Emperors.</hi> By the ſame rule, ſeeing the Prieſts and Scribes and Phariſees, men of greateſt repute among the Jewes for vertue, learning and wiſdome, held it a lawful and a pious work to perſecute Chriſt and his Apoſtles, it was lawful for their people to follow their leaders: for herein, according to your Doctrin, they proceeded prudently, and according to the conduct of opinion, maturely weighed and approved by men (as it ſeem'd to them) of vertue, learning and wiſdome; nay by ſuch as ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> chair, and of whom it was ſaid, <hi>Whatſoever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do:</hi> which Univerſal you pretend is to be underſtood univerſally, and without any reſtriction or limitation. And as lawful was it for the Pagans to perſecute the Primitive Chriſtians, becauſe <hi>Trajan</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> men of great vertue and wiſdome were of this opinion. Laſtly, that moſt impious and deteſtable Doctrin, (which by a foul calumny you impute to me, who abhorre and deteſt it,) that <hi>men may be ſaved in any Religion,</hi> followes from this ground unavoidably. For certainly, Religion is one of thoſe things which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary only becauſe it is commanded: for if none were commanded under pain of damnation, how could it be damnable to be of any or to be of none? Neither can it be damnable to be of a falſe Religion; unleſs it be a ſin to be ſo. For neither are men ſaved by good luck, but only by obedience; neither are they damned for their ill fortune, but for ſin and diſobedience. Death is the wages of nothing but ſin: and S. <hi>James</hi> ſure intended to deliver the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate cauſe of ſin and death in thoſe words, <hi>Luſt when it hath conceived bringeth forth ſin and ſin, when it is finiſhed bringeth forth death.</hi> Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in ſuch things, according to your doctrin, it is ſufficient for avoiding of ſin that we proceed prudently, and by the conduct of ſome probable opinion, mature y weighed and approv'd by men of learning, vertue and wiſdome: and ſeeing neither Jews want their <hi>Gamaliels,</hi> nor Pagans their <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus's,</hi> nor any ſect of Chriſtians ſuch profeſſors and maintainers of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſects, as are eſteem'd by the people, which know no better (and that very reaſonably) men of vertue, learning, and wiſdome, it followes evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the embracing their religion proceeds upon ſuch reaſon as may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent their action to be prudent, and this (ſay you) is <hi>ſufficient for avoiding of ſin,</hi> and therefore certainly for avoiding damnation, for <hi>that in humane of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs</hi> and diſcourſe, <hi>evidence and certainty cannot be alwayes</hi> expected. I have ſtood the longer upon the refutation of this doctrin, not only becauſe it is impious, and becauſe bad uſe is made of it, and worſe may be; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                           </gap> becauſe the contrary poſition, <hi>That men are bound for avoiding ſin alwayes to take the ſafeſt way,</hi> is a fair and ſure foundation, for a cleer confutation of the main Concluſion, which in this Chapter you labour in vain to prove, and a certain proof that in regard of the precept of charity towards ones ſelf, and of obedience to God, Papiſts (unleſs ignorance excuſe them) are in ſtate of ſin, as long as they remain in ſubjection to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. For if the ſafer way for avoiding ſin, be alſo the ſafer way for avoiding damnation, then certainly it will not be hard to determin, that the way of Proteſtants muſt be more ſecure, and the <hi>Roman</hi> way more dangerous: Take but into your conſideration theſe enſuing controverſies: Whether
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:64345:192"/>it be lawful to worſhip Pictures? to picture the Trinity? to invocate Saints and Angels? to deny Lay-men the Cup in the Sacrament? to adore the Sacrament? to prohibit certain Orders of men and women to marry? to celebrate the publique ſervice of God in a language which the aſſiſtants ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally underſtand not; and you will not chooſe but confeſs that in all theſe you are on the more dangerous ſide for the committing of ſin, and we on that which is more ſecure. For in all theſe things, if we ſay true, you do that which is impious: on the other ſide, if you were in the right, yet we might be ſecure enough, for we ſhould only not do ſomething which you confeſs not neceſſary to be done. We pretend, and are ready to juſtifie out of principles agreed upon between us, that in all theſe things, you violate the manifeſt commandements of God; and alleadge ſuch texts of Scripture againſt you, as, if you would weigh them with any indifference, would put the matter out of queſtion, but certainly you cannot with any modeſt deny, but that at leaſt they make it queſtionable. On the other ſide, you cannot with any face pretend, and, if you ſhould, know not how to go about to prove, that there is any neceſſity of doing any of theſe things; that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful not to worſhip pictures, not to picture the Trinity, not to invocate Saints and Angels, not to give all men the entire Sacrament, not to adore the Euchariſt, not to prohibit marriage, not to celebrate divine ſervice in an unknown tongue: I ſay, you neither do nor can pretend that there is any law of God which enjoyns us, no nor ſo much as an Evangelical Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel that adviſes us to do any of theſe things. Now <hi>where no law is, there can be no ſin, for ſin is the tranſgreſsion of the law;</hi> It remains therefore that if your Church ſhould forbear to do theſe things, ſhe muſt undoubtedly herein be free from all danger and ſuſpicion of ſin; whereas your acting of them, muſt be, if not certainly impious, without all condradiction queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable and dangerous. I conclude therefore that which was to be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that if the ſafer way for avoiding ſin, be alſo (as moſt certainly it is) the ſafer way for avoiding damnation, then certainly the way of Proteſtants muſt be more ſafe, and the <hi>Roman</hi> way more dangerous. You will ſay, I know, that <hi>theſe things being by your Church concluded lawful, we are obliged by God, though not to do, yet to approve them: at leaſt in your judgement we are ſo, and therefore our condition is as queſtionable as yours.</hi> I anſw. The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of your Church is no common principle agreed upon between us, and therefore from that you are not to diſpute againſt us. We might preſs you with our judgement as well and as juſtly as you do us with yours. Beſides, this very thing that your Church hath determin'd theſe things lawful, and commanded the approbation of them, is that whereof ſhe is accuſed by us, and we maintain you have done wickedly, or at leaſt very dangerouſly, in ſo determining; becauſe in theſe very determinations, you have forſaken that way which was ſecure from ſin, and have choſen that which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but know to be very queſtionable and doubtful; and conſequently have forſaken the ſafe way to heaven, and taken a way which is full of danger. And therefore, although if your obedience to your Church were queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you might flie for ſhelter to your Churches determinations, yet when theſe very determinations are accuſed, me thinks they ſhould not be alleag'd in defence of themſelves. But you will ſay, Your Church is infallible, and therefore her determinations not unlawful. Anſw. They that accuſe your Church of error, you may be ſure do queſtion her infallibility:
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:64345:193"/>ſhew therefore where it is written, that your Church is infallible, and the diſpute will be ended. But till you do ſo, give me leave rather to conclude thus, Your Church in many of her determinations, chooſes not that way which is moſt ſecure from ſin, and therefore not the ſafeſt way to ſalvation; than vainly to imagine her infallible, and thereupon to believe, though ſhe teach not the ſecureſt way to avoid ſin, yet ſhe teaches the certainſt way to obtain ſalvation.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. In the cloſe of this Number, you ſay as followes, <hi>If it may appear though not certain, yet at leaſt probable, that Proteſtancy unrepented deſtroyes ſalvation, and withal that there is a ſafer way, it will follow that they are obliged by the law of Charity to that ſafe way.</hi> Anſ. Make this appear, and I will never perſwade any man to continue a Proteſtant; for if I ſhould, I ſhould perſwade him to continue a fool. But after all theſe prolix diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, ſtill we ſee you are at, <hi>If it may appear:</hi> From whence without all Ifs and Ands, that appears ſufficiently, which I ſaid in the beginning of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> that the <hi>four firſt Paragraphs</hi> of this Chapter are wholly ſpent in an unneceſſary introduction, unto that which never by any man in his right wits was denyed, That <hi>men in wiſdome and charity to themſelves are to take the ſafeſt way to eternal ſalvation.</hi>

                        <p n="11">11. <hi>Ad</hi> §. 5. In the <hi>fift</hi> you begin to make ſome ſhew of arguing, and tell us, that <hi>Proteſtants have reaſon to doubt in what caſe they ſtand, from what you have ſaid about the Churches univerſal infallibility, and of her being Judge of Controverſies,</hi> &amp;c. Anſ. From all that which you have ſaid, they have reaſon only to conclude that you have nothing to ſay. They have as much reaſon to doubt, whether there can be any Motion, from what <hi>Zeno</hi> ſaies in <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Phyſicks, as to doubt, from what you have ſaid, Whether the <hi>Roman</hi> Church may poſſibly erre. For this I dare ſay, that not the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of <hi>Zeno's</hi> arguments but is ſtronger than the ſtrongeſt of yours, and that you would be more perplext in anſwering any one of them, than I have been in anſwering all yours. You are pleas'd to repeat two or three of them in this Section, and in all probability ſo wiſe a man as you are, if he would repeat any, would repeat the beſt; and therefore if I deſire the Reader by theſe to judge of the reſt, I ſhall deſire but ordinary juſtice.</p>
                        <p n="12">12. The firſt of them being put into form ſtands thus, <hi>Every leaſt error in faith deſtroys the nature of faith; It is certain that ſome Proteſtants do erre, And therefore they want the ſubſtance of Faith.</hi> The Major of which Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm I have formerly confuted by unanſwerable arguments out of one of your own beſt Authors, who ſhewes plainly that he hath amongſt you, as ſtrange as you make it, many other abettors. Beſides, if it were true, it would conclude that either you or the Dominicans have no faith, in as much as you oppoſe one another as much as Arminians and Calviniſts.</p>
                        <p n="13">13. The ſecond Argument ſtands thus, <hi>Since all Proteſtants pretend the like certainty, it is cleer that none of them have any certainty at all?</hi> Which argument if it were good, then what can hinder but this muſt alſo be ſo, Since Proteſtants and papiſts pretend the like certainty, it is cleer that none of them have any certainty at all! And this too: Since all Chriſtians pretend the like certainty, it is cleer that none of them have any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, at all! And thirdly this: Since men of all religions pretend a like certainty, it is cleer that none of them have any at all! And laſtly this: Since oft-times they which are abuſed with a ſpecious Paralogiſm, pretend
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:64345:193"/>the like certainty with them which demonſtrate, it is cleer that none of them have any certainty at all! Certainly, Sir, Zeal and the Devil did ſtrangely blind you, if you did not ſee that theſe horrid impieties were the immediate conſequences of your poſitions, if you did ſee it, and yet would ſet them down, you deſerve a worſe cenſure. Yet ſuch as theſe, are all the arguments wherewith you conceive your ſelf to have prov'd undoubtedly, that <hi>Proteſtants have reaſon, at leaſt to doubt in what caſe they ſtand.</hi> Neither am I afraid to venture my life upon it, that your ſelf ſhall not chooſe ſo much as one out of all the pack, which I will not ſhew before indifferent Judges, either to be impertinent to the queſtion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequent in the deduction, or grounded upon ſome falſe, or at leaſt uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain foundation.</p>
                        <p n="14">14. Your third and fourth argument may be thus put into one; <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants cannot tell what points in particular be fundamental; therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, whether they or their brethren do not erre fundamentally, and whether their difference be not fundamental.</hi> Both which deductions I have formerly ſhewed to be moſt inconſequent; for knowing the Scripture to contain all fundamentals (though many more points beſides, which makes it difficult to ſay preciſely what is fundamental, and what not,) knowing this, I ſay, and believing it, what can hinder but that I may be well aſſured, that I believe all fundamentals, and that all who believe the Scripture ſincerely as well as I, do not differ from me in any thing fundamental?</p>
                        <p n="15">15. In the cloſe of this Section, you ſay, that <hi>you omit to add that we want the Sacrament of Repentance, inſtituted for the remiſsion of ſins, or at leaſt we muſt confeſs, that we hold it not neceſſary: and yet our own brethren the Century-writers acknowledge that in the times of</hi> Cyprian <hi>and</hi> Tertullian, <hi>private confeſſion even of thoughts was uſed, and that it was then commanded and thought neceſſary; and then our Ordination,</hi> you ſay, <hi>is very doubtful, and all that depends upon it.</hi> Anſ.

That your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Rhenanus,</hi> acknowledges the contrary, and aſſures us, That the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion then required and in uſe, was publique, and before the Church, and that your auricular Confeſſion was not then in the world; for which his mouth is ſtopped by your <hi>Index Expurgatorious.</hi>

                              <item>3. That it might be then commanded, and being commanded, be thought neceſſary, and yet be but a Church-Conſtitution. Neither will I deny, if the preſent Church, could, and would ſo order it, that the abuſes of it might be prevented, and conceiving it profitable, ſhould enjoyn the uſe of it, but that being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it would be neceſſary.</item>
                              <item>4. Concerning our Ordinations, beſides that I have proved it impoſſible that they ſhould be ſo doubtful as yours, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your own principles; I anſwer, that experience ſhews them certainly ſufficient to bring men to faith and repentance, and conſequently to ſalvation; and that if there were any ſecret defect of any thing neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which we cannot help, God will certainly ſupply it.</item>

In the <hi>ſixth,</hi> you ſay, <hi>you will not repeat, but only put us again in mind that unleſs the Roman Church were the true Charch there was no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church upon earth, a thing ſo manifeſt that Proteſtants themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,</hi>

Nor thirdly do you here make good ſo much as with one fallacy, that if the <hi>Roman</hi> Church were then the viſible Church, it muſt needs be now the only or the ſafer way to heaven; and yet the connexion of this conſequence was very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be ſhown.

May you be pleaſed to look back to your own Book, and you ſhall find it ſo as I have ſaid: and that at leaſt in a hundred other places you make your advantage of this falſe imputation: which when you have obſerv'd, and withal conſidered that your ſelf plainly intimate, that D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s diſcourſes, which here you cenſure, would be good and concluding, if we did not (as we do not) free you from damnable error; I hope you will acknowledge that my vouchſafing theſe <hi>Sections</hi> the honour of any farther anſwer, is a great ſupererogation in point of civility. Nevertheleſs partly that I may the more ingratiate my ſelf with you, but eſpecially, that I may ſtop their mouths who will be apt to ſay, that every word of yours which I ſhould omit to ſpeak to, is an

Firſt then, to your little parentheſis, which you interline among D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s words, §. 7. <hi>That any ſmall error in faith deſtroyes all faith,</hi> (To omit what hath been ſaid before,) I anſwer here what is proper for this place: that S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> whoſe authority is here ſtood upon, thought other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: He conceived the Donatiſts to hold ſome error in faith, and yet not to have no faith. His words of them to this purpoſe are moſt pregnant and evident, <hi>You are with us</hi> (ſaith he to the Donatiſts. Ep. 48.) <hi>as Baptiſm, in the Creed, and the other Sacraments:</hi> And again, <hi>Super geſtis cum emerit: Thou haſt proved to me that thou haſt Faith: prove to me likewiſe that thou haſt Charity.</hi> Parallel to which words are theſe of <hi>Optatus, Amongſt us and you is one Eccleſiaſtical converſation, common leſſons, the ſame faith, the ſame Sacraments.</hi> Where, by the way, we may obſerve, that in the judgement of theſe Fathers, even Donatiſts, though Heretiques and Sciſmatiques, gave true Ordination, the true Sacrament of Matrimony, true Sacramental Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, Confirmation, the true Sacrament of the Euchariſt, true Extream Unction; or elſe (chooſe you whether) ſome of theſe were not then eſteem'd Sacraments. But for Ordination, whether he held it a Sacrament or no, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he held that it remain'd with them entire: for ſo he ſaies in expreſs terms, in his book againſt <hi>Parmenianus</hi> his Epiſtle. Which Doctrin if you can reconcile with the preſent Doctrin of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, <hi>Eris mihi magnus Apollo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="20">20. Whereas, in the beginning of the 8. Sect. <hi>You deny that your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from our confeſsing the poſsibility of your Salvation, is for ſimple people alone, but for all men:</hi> I anſwer, Certainly whoſoever is moved with it, muſt be ſo ſimple as to think this a good and a concluding reaſon; Some ignorant men in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church may be ſav'd, by the confeſſion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, (which is indeed all that they confeſs,) therefore it is ſafe for me to be of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and he that does think ſo, what reaſon is there why he ſhould not think this as good; Ignorant Proteſtants may be ſaved, by the confeſſion of Papiſts, (by name, Mr. <hi>K.</hi>) therefore it is ſafe for me to be of the Proteſtant Church? Whereas you ſay, that <hi>this your argument is grounded upon an inevitable neceſsity for us, either to grant Salvation to your Church, or to entail certain damnation upon our own, becauſe ours can have no being till</hi> Luther, <hi>unleſs yours be ſuppoſed to have been the true Church.</hi> I anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, This cauſe is no cauſe: For firſt, as <hi>Luther</hi> had no being before <hi>Luther,</hi> and yet he was when he was, though he was not before; ſo there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance in the terms, but that there might be a true Church after <hi>Luther,</hi> though there were none for ſome ages before; as, ſince <hi>Columbus</hi> his time, there have been Chriſtians in <hi>America,</hi> though before there were none for many ages. For neither do you ſhew, neither does it appear, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netation of Churches is univocal, that nothing but a Church can poſſibly beget a Church; nor that the preſent being of a true Church, depends neceſſarily upon the perpetuity of a Church in all ages; any more than the preſent being of Peripateticks or Stoicks depends upon a perpetual pedegree of them. For though I at no hand deny the Churches perpetuity, yet I ſee nothing in your book to make me underſtand, that the truth of the preſent depends upon it, nor any thing that can hinder, but that a falſe Church, (Gods providence over-watching and over-ruling it,) may preſerve the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:64345:195"/>means of confuting their own Hereſies, and reducing men to truth, and ſo raiſing a true Church, I mean the integrity and the authority of the word of God with men. Thus the Jewes preſerve means to make men Chriſtians, and Papiſts preſerve means to make men Proteſtants, and Proteſtants (which you ſay are a falſe Church) do, as you pretend, preſerve means to make men Papiſts; that is, their own Bibles, out of which you pretend to be able to prove that they are to be Papiſts. Secondly, you ſhew not, nor does it appear, that the perpetuity of <hi>the Church</hi> depends on the truth of <hi>yours.</hi> For though you talk vainly, as if you were the only men in the world before <hi>Luther,</hi> yet the world knows that this is but talk, and that there were other Chriſtians beſides you, which might have perpetuated the Church though you had not been. Laſtly, you ſhew not, neither doth it appear, that your being acknowledged in ſome ſenſe a true Church, doth neceſſarily import, that we muſt grant Salvation to it, unleſs, by it, you underſtand the ignorant members of it, which is a very unuſual <hi>Synechdoche.</hi>

You ſay, <hi>They believe themſelves juſtified by faith alone, and that by that faith whereby they believe themſelves juſtified:</hi> Some peradventure do ſo, but withal they believe that that faith which is alone, and unaccompanied with <hi>ſincere</hi> and univerſal obedience, is to be eſteem'd not faith but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and is at no hand ſufficient to juſtification: that though Charity be not imputed unto juſtification, yet is it required as a neceſſary diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the perſon to be juſtified, and that though in regard of the imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, no man can be juſtified by it, yet that, on the other ſide, no man can be juſtified without it. So that upon the whole matter, a man may truly and ſafely ſay, that the Doctrin of theſe Proteſtants, taken altogether, is not a Doctrin of Liberty, not a Doctrin that turns hope into preſumtion and carnal ſecurity: though it may juſtly be feared, that many licentious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, taking it by halfes have made this wicked uſe of it. For my part, I do heartily wiſh, that by publique Authority it were ſo ordered, that no man ſhould ever preach or print this Doctrin that Faith alone juſtifies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he joyns this together with it, that Univerſal Obedience is neceſſary to ſalvation And beſides that thoſe Chapters of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> which intreat of juſtification by faith, without the works of the Law, were never read in the Church, but when the 13. Chapter of the 1. Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> concerning the abſolute neceſſity of Charity, ſhould be, to prevent miſpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, read together with them.</p>
                        <p n="33">33. Whereas you ſay, that <hi>ſome Proteſtants do expreſly affirm the former point to be the ſoul of the Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and therefore they muſt want the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical vertue of Hope, and that none can have true hope, while they hope to be ſaved in their communion.</hi> I anſw. They have great reaſon to believe the Doctrin of juſtification, by faith only, a point of great weight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, if it be rightly underſtood: that is, they have reaſon to eſteem it a principal and neceſſary duty of a Chriſtian, to place his hope of juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſalvation, not in the perfection of his own righteouſneſs (which if it be imperfect will not juſtifie,) but only in the mercies of God through Chriſts ſatisfaction; and yet, notwithſtanding this, nay the rather for this, may preſerve themſelves in the right temper of good Chriſtians, which is a happy mixture and ſweet compoſition of confidence and fear. If this Doctrin be otherwiſe expounded than I have here expounded, I will not undertake the juſtification of it: only I will ſay (that which I may do truly) that I never knew any Proteſtant ſuch a ſoli-ſidian, but that he did believe theſe divine truths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                           <hi>That he muſt make his calling certain by good works: That he muſt work out his ſalvation with Fear and Trembling, and that while he does not ſo, he can have no well grounded hope of Salvation:</hi>
                           <pb n="363" facs="tcp:64345:198" rendition="simple:additions"/>I ſay, I never met with any who did not believe theſe divine Truths, and that with a more firm, and a more unſhaken aſſent, than he does that himſelf is predeſtinate, and that he is juſtified by believing himſelf juſtified. I never met with any ſuch, who if he ſaw there were a neceſſity to do either, would not rather forgoe his belief of theſe Doctrins, than the former: theſe which he ſees diſputed and contradicted and oppoſed with a great multitude of very potent Arguments; than thoſe, which being the expreſs words of Scripture whoſoever ſhould call into queſtion, could not with any modeſty pretend to the title of Chriſtian. And therefore, there is no reaſon but we may believe, that their full aſſurance of the former Doctrin, doth very well qualifie their perſwaſion of the later; and that the former (as alſo the lives of may of them do ſufficiently teſtifie) are more effectual to temper their hope, and to keep it at a ſtay of a filial and modeſt aſſurance of Gods favour, built upon the conſcience of his love and fear, than the later can be to ſwell and puffe them up into vain confidence and ungrounded preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption This reaſon joyn'd with our experience of the honeſt and religious converſation of many men of this opinion, is a ſufficient ground for Charity, to hope well of their Hope: and to aſſure our ſelves, that it cannot be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, but rather moſt acceptable to God, if, notwithſtanding this diverſity of opinion, we embrace each other with the ſtrict embraces of love and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. To you and your Church we leave it, to ſeparate Chriſtians from the Church, and to proſcribe them from heaven upon trivial and trifling cauſes: As for our ſelves, we conceive a charitable judgement of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren and their errors, though untrue, much more pleaſing to God than a true judgement, if it be uncharitable; and therefore ſhall alwayes chooſe (if we do err) to err on the milder and more merciful part, and rather to retain thoſe in our Communion which deſerve to be ejected, than eject thoſe that deſerve to be retain'd.</p>
                        <p n="34">34. Laſtly, whereas you ſay, that <hi>ſeeing Proteſtants differ about the point of Juſtification, you muſt needs inferre that they want Unity in faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently all faith, and then that they cannot agree what points are fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall;</hi> I anſwer, to the firſt of theſe inferences, that, as well might you inferre it upon <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Polycrates;</hi> upon <hi>Stephen</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and Saint <hi>Cyprian:</hi> in aſmuch as it is undeniably evident that what one of thoſe eſteemed neceſſary to ſalvation the other eſteemed not ſo. But points of Doctrin (as all other things) are as they are, and not as they are eſteemed: neither can a neceſſary point be made unneceſſary by being ſo accounted, nor an unneceſſary point be made neceſſary by being overvalued. But as the ancient Philoſophers, (whoſe different opinions about the Soule of man you may read in <hi>Ariſtotle de anima,</hi> and <hi>Cicero's Tuſculan Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>) notwithſtanding their divers opinions touching the nature of the ſoule, yet all of them had ſoules, and ſoules of the ſame nature: Or as thoſe Phyſitians who diſpute whether the Brain or Heart be the principall part of a man, yet all of them have brains and have hearts, and herein agree ſufficiently: So likewiſe, though ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants eſteem that Doctrine the ſoule of the Church, which others do not ſo highly value, yet this hinders not but that which is indeed the ſoule of the Church may be in both ſorts of them: And though one account that a neceſſary truth which others account neither neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary nor perhaps true; yet, this notwithſtanding, in thoſe truths which
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:64345:199"/>are truly and really neceſſary they may all agree. For no Argument can be more ſophiſtical than this; They differ in ſome points which they eſteem neceſſary; Therefore they differ in ſome that indeed and in truth are ſo.</p>
                        <p n="35">35. Now as concerning the other Inference, <hi>That they cannot agree what points are fundamental:</hi> I have ſaid and prov'd formerly that there is no ſuch neceſſity as you imagine or pretend, that men ſhould certainly know what is, and what is not fundamental. They that believe all things plainly delivered in Scripture, believe all things fundamental, and are at ſufficient Unity in matters of Faith, though they cannot preciſely and exactly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between what is fundamental, and what is profitable: nay though by error they miſtake ſome vain, or perhaps ſome hurtful, opinions for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and fundamental Truths.<note place="margin">C <hi>3.</hi> Sect. <hi>54.</hi> &amp; alibi.</note> Beſides, I have ſhewed above, that as Proteſtants do not agree (for you over-reach in ſaying, they cannot) touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what points are fundamental; ſo neither do you agree what points are defin'd and ſo to be accounted, and what are not: nay, nor concerning the ſubject in which God hath placed this pretended Authority of defining: ſome of you ſetling it in the Pope himſelf, though alone without a Councel, Others in a Councel, though divided from the Pope: Others only in the conjunction of Councel and Pope: Others not in this neither, but in the acceptation of the preſent Church Univerſal: Laſtly, others not attributing it to this neither, but only to the perpetual Succeſſion of the Church of all ages: of which divided Company, it is very evident and undeniable, that every former may be and are obliged to hold many things defin'd and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſary, which the latter, according to their own grounds, have no obligation to do, nay cannot do ſo upon any firm and ſure and infallible foundation.</p>

                     <p>For firſt, <hi>I have not proceeded by a meer deſtructive way</hi> (as you call it) <hi>nor objected ſuch difficulties againſt your Religion, as, upon examination, tend to the overthrow of all Religion,</hi> but have ſhewed that the truth of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity is cleerly independent upon the truth of Popery: and that on the other ſide, the arguments you urge, and the courſes you take, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of your Religion, do manifeſtly tend (if they be cloſely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently followed) to the deſtruction of all Religion, and lead men by the hand to Atheiſm and Impiety; whereof I have given you ocular demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations in divers places of my book, but eſpecially, in my anſwer to your <hi>Direction to N.

                     </p>
                     <p>Neither can I <hi>diſcover any repugnance between any one part of my anſwer and any other,</hi> though I have uſed many more judicious and more ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyes than mine own, to make, if it were poſsible, ſuch a diſcovery: and therefore am in good hope, that, though the muſick I have made be but dull and flat, and even downright plain-ſong, even your curious and critical ears ſhall diſcover no diſcord in it; but on the other ſide, I have charg'd you frequently, and very juſtly, with manifeſt contradiction and retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your own aſſertions, and not ſeldom of the main grounds you build upon, and the principal concluſions which you endeavour to maintain: which I conceive my ſelf to have made apparent even to the eye, c. 2. §. 5. c. 3. §. 88. c. 4. §. 14. and 24. c. 5. §. 93. c. 6. §. 6, 7, 12, 17. c. 7. §. 29. and in many other parts of my Anſwer.</p>
                     <p>And though I did never pretend to defend D. <hi>Potter</hi> abſolutely and in all things, but only ſo farre as he defends Truth; (neither did D. <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> deſire me, nor any law of God or man oblige me, to defend him any farther,) yet I do not find that I have cauſe to differ from him in any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of moment: particularly, <hi>not concerning the infallibility of God's Church,</hi> which I grant with him to be infallible in fundamentals, becauſe if it ſhould erre in fundamentals, it were not the Church: <hi>Nor concerning the ſupernaturality of Faith,</hi> which I know and believe as well as you, <hi>to be the gift of God,</hi> and <hi>that fleſh and bloud reveal'd it not unto us, but our Father which is in heaven.</hi> But now if it were demanded, What defence you can make for deſerting <hi>Charity Miſtaken,</hi> in the main Queſtion diſputed
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:64345:200"/>between him and Dr. <hi>Potter, Whether Proteſtancy, without a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and dereliction of it, deſtroy Salvation,</hi> whereof I have convinc'd you? I believe your anſwer would be much like that which <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> makes in the Metamorphoſis for his running away from his friend <hi>Neſtor,</hi> that is, none at all.</p>
                     <p>For <hi>Oppoſing the Articles of the Church of England,</hi> the Approbation, I preſume, cleers my Book from this imputation.</p>
                     <p>And whereas you give me a Caution, <hi>that my grounds deſtroy not the belief of diverſe Doctrins which all good Chriſtians believe, yea and of all verities that cannot be prov'd by natural reaſon:</hi> I profeſs ſincerely, that I do not know nor believe, that any ground laid by me in my whole Book, is any way inconſiſtent with any one ſuch Doctrin, or with any verity revealed in the Word of God, though never ſo improbable or incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible to Natural Reaſon: and if I thought there were, I would deal with it, as thoſe primitive Converts dealt with their curious Books in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the Epiſtle of St. <hi>James, and thoſe other Books which were anciently controverted, and are now received by the Church of</hi> England <hi>as Canonical;</hi> I am ſo far from relying upon any Principles which muſt (to my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) bring with them the denial of the authority of them, that I my ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them all to be Canonical.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>overthrowing the Infallibility of all Scripture,</hi> my Book is ſo innocent of it, that the Infallibility of Scripture is the chiefeſt of all my grounds.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, for Arguments <hi>tending to prove an impoſsibility of all Divine, Supernatural, Infallible Faith and Religion,</hi> I aſſure my ſelf, that if you were ten times more a Spider than you are, you could ſuck no ſuch poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from them. My heart, I am ſure, is innocent of any ſuch intention: and the Searcher of all hearts knows, that I had no other end in writing this Book, but to confirm, to the uttermoſt of my ability, the truth of the Divine and Infallible Religion of our deareſt Lord and Saviour Chriſt Jeſus, which I am ready to ſeal and confirm, not with my Arguments only, but my Bloud!</p>
                     <p>Now theſe are the Directions which you have been pleas'd to give me, whether out of a fear that I might otherwiſe deviate from them, or out of a deſire to make others think ſo: But howſoever, I have not, to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſwarved from them in any thing, which puts me in good hope, that my Anſwer to this firſt Part of your Book will give even to you your ſelf indifferent good ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>I have alſo provided, though this were more than I undertook, a juſt and punctual examination and refutation of your <hi>ſecond Part:</hi> But (if you will give your conſent) I am reſolv'd to ſuppreſs it, and that for divers ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and reaſonable conſiderations.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe the diſcuſſion of the Controverſies intreated of in the <hi>firſt Part</hi> (if we ſhall think fit to proceed in it, as I for my part ſhall, ſo long as I have truth to reply,) will, I conceive, be ſufficient employment for us, though we caſt off the burden of thoſe many leſſer diſputes which remain behind in the Second. And perhaps we may do God and his Church more ſervice by exactly diſcuſſing and fully clearing the truth in theſe few, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>an by handling many after a ſleight and perfunctory manner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="367" facs="tcp:64345:200"/>
Secondly, becauſe the addition of the Second Part, whether for your purpoſe or mine, is clearly unneceſſary: there being no underſtanding man, Papiſt or Proteſtant, but will confeſs, that (for as much as concerns the main queſtion now in agitation, about the ſaveableneſs of Proteſtants) if the firſt part of your Book be anſwered, there needs no reply to the Second: as on the other ſide, I ſhall willingly grant, if I have not anſwered the Firſt, I cannot anſwer a great part of the Second.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, becauſe the addition of the Second not only is unneceſſary, but in effect by your ſelf confeſs'd to be ſo. For in your preamble to your Second Part you tell us, <hi>That the ſubſtance of the preſent Controverſie is handled in the firſt: and therein alſo you pretend to have anſwered the chief grounds of D.</hi> Potters <hi>book:</hi> So that in replying to your Second Part, I ſhall do little elſe but purſue ſhadows.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, becauſe your Second Part (ſetting aſide Repetitions and Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences) is in a manner made up of Diſputes about particular matters, which you are very importunate to have forborn, as ſuſpecting, at leaſt pretending to ſuſpect, that they <hi>were brought in purpoſely by D.</hi> Potter <hi>to da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle the Reader's eyes and diſtract his mind, that he might not ſee the clearneſs of the reaſons brought in defence of the General Doctrin delivered in Charity Miſtaken.</hi> All which you are likely enough (if there be occaſion) to ſay again to me; and therefore I am reſolv'd for once even to humour you ſo farre as to keep my diſcourſe within thoſe very liſts and limits which your ſelf have preſcrib'd, and to deal with you upon no other arguments, but only thoſe wherein you conceive your chief advantage and principal ſtrength, and, as it were, your <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s lock to lye: wherein if I gain the cauſe clearly from you (as I verily hope by Gods help I ſhall do) it cannot but redound much to the honour of the truth maintain'd by me, which by ſo weak a Champion can overcome ſuch an <hi>Achilles</hi> for error, even in his ſtrongeſt holds.</p>
                     <p>For theſe reaſons, although I have made ready an anſwer to your Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part, and therein have made it ſufficiently evident: That for ſhifting evaſions from D. <hi>Potter</hi>'s arguments: for impertinent cavills, and frivolous exceptions, and injurious calumnies againſt him for his miſalleadging of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: For proceeding upon falſe and ungrounded principles; for making inconſequent and ſophiſtical deductions, and, in a word, for all the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of an ill anſwer your Second Part is no way ſecond to the firſt. Yet notwithſtanding all this advantage, I am reſolv'd, if you will give me leave, either wholly to ſuppreſs it, or at leaſt to deferre the publication of it untill I ſee what exceptions, upon a twelve-months examination (for ſo long I am well aſſur'd you have had it in your hands) you can take at this which is now publiſhed, that ſo if my grounds be diſcovered falſe I may give over building on them: or (if it ſhall be thought fit) build on more ſecurely when it ſhall appear that nothing material and of moment, is or can be objected againſt them. This I ſay, upon a ſuppoſition that your ſelf will allow theſe reaſons for ſatisfying and ſufficient, and not repent of the motion which your ſelf has made, of reducing the Controverſie between us to this ſhort Iſſue. But in caſe your minde be altered, upon the leaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation you ſhall give me, that you do but deſire to have it out, your deſire ſhall prevail with me above all other reaſons, and you ſhall not fail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it with all convenient ſpeed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="368" facs="tcp:64345:201"/>
Only that my Anſwer may be compleat, and that I may have all my work together, and not be troubled my ſelf, nor enforc'd to trouble you, with after-reckonings, I would firſt entreat you to make good your Promiſe of not <hi>omitting to anſwer all the particles of D.</hi> Potters <hi>book, which may any way import,</hi> and now at leaſt to take notice of ſome (as it ſeems to me) not unconſiderable paſſages of it, which between your firſt and ſecond Part, as it were between two ſtools, have been ſuffer'd hitherto to fall to the ground, and not been vouchſaf'd any anſwer at all.</p>
                     <p>For after this neglectful faſhion you have paſſed by in ſilence, Firſt, his diſcourſe, wherein he proves briefly, but very effectually, that <hi>Proteſtants may be ſav'd, and that the Roman Church, eſpecially the Jeſuits are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable. S.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9. Secondly, the authorities whereby he juſtifies, That <hi>the ancient Fathers, by the Roman underſtood alwayes a particular, and never the Catholique Church:</hi> to which purpoſe he alleageth the words of <hi>Ignatius, Ambroſe, Innocentius, Celeſtine, Nicolaus, S.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 10. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto you ſay nothing, neither do you infringe his Obſervation with any one Inſtance to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the greateſt and moſt ſubſtantial part of his anſwers to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of <hi>Charity Miſtaken,</hi> built upon <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. and in particular many pregnant and convincing Texts of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, quoted in the margent of his book, <hi>p.</hi> 25. to prove that the Judges of the Synagogue (whoſe Infallibility yet you make an Argument of yours, and therefore muſt be more credible then yours) are vainly pretended to have been infallible: but as they were oblig'd to judge according to the Law, ſo were obnoxious to deviations from it. <hi>S.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 23, 24, 25, 26, 27.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, his diſcourſe wherein he ſhewes the difference between the Prayers for the dead uſed by the Ancients, and thoſe now in uſe in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, the Authority of three Ancient, and above twenty modern Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of your own Church alleadg'd by him, to ſhew that in their opinion even Pagans, and therefore much more erring Chriſtians (if their lives were morally honeſt) by Gods extraordinary mercy and Chriſts merit may be ſaved. <hi>S.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 45.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, a great part of his diſcourſe whereby he declares that actual and external Communion with the Church is not of abſolute neceſsity to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: nay that thoſe might be ſaved whom the Church utterly refus'd to admit to her Communion. <hi>S.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 46, 47, 48, 49.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, his diſcourſe concerning the Churches latitude, which hath in it a clear determination of the main Controverſie againſt you: For therein he proves plainly, that all appertain <hi>to the Church, who believe that Jeſus</hi> is the Chriſt the ſonne <hi>of God and Saviour of the world with ſubmiſſion to his Doctrin</hi> in mind and will: which he irrefragably demonſtrates by many evident Texts of Scripture, containing the ſubſtance of his Aſſertion even in terms. <hi>S.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 114, 115, 116, 117.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, that wherein he ſhews by many pertinent examples, that <hi>groſſe error and true Faith, may be lodged together in the</hi> ſame mind: And that men are not <hi>chargeable with the damnable conſequences of their erroneous opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. S.</hi> 4 <hi>p.</hi> 112.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly a very great part of his Chapter touching <hi>the diſſentions of the Roman-Church,</hi> which he ſhews (againſt the pretences of <hi>Charity Miſtaken</hi>)

                     <p>For ſo great a change, as between Presbyterial Government and Epiſcopal, could not poſſibly have prevailed all the world over in a little time. Had Epiſcopal Government been an aberration from (or a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of) the Government left in the Churches by the Apoſtles, it had been very ſtrange, that it ſhould have been received inany <hi>one</hi> Church ſo ſuddainly, or that it ſhould have prevailed in <hi>all</hi> for many Ages after. <hi>Variâſſe debuerat error Eccleſiarum: quod autem apud omnes unum eſt, non eſt erratum, ſed traditum. Had the Churches err'd, they would have varied: What therefore is one and the ſame amongſt all, came not ſure by error, but tradition.</hi> Thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> argues very probably, from the conſent of the Churches of his time, not long after the Apoſtles, and that in matter of opinion much more ſubject to unobſerv'd alteration. But that in the frame and ſubſtance of the neceſſary Government of the Church, a thing alwayes in uſe and practice, there ſhould be ſo ſuddain a change as preſently after the Apoſtles times; and ſo univerſal, as received in all the Churches; this is clearly <hi>impoſsible.</hi>

                     <p>For, What univerſal cauſe can be aſſigned or faigned of this <hi>univerſal</hi> Apoſtaſie? You will not imagine that the Apoſtles, all or any of them, made any decree for this change, when they were living; or left order for it in any Will or Teſtament, when they were dying. This were to grant the queſtion; to wit, That the Apoſtles, being to leave the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Churches themſelves, and either ſeeing by experience, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing by the Spirit of God, the diſtractions and diſorders, which would ariſe from a multitude of equals, ſubſtituted Epiſcopal Government inſtead of their own. General Councels to make a Law for a general change,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64345:205"/>for many ages there was none. There was no Chriſtian Emperour, no coercive power over the Church to enforce it. Or, if there had been any, we know no force was equal to the courage of the Chriſtians of thoſe times. Their lives were then at command (for they had not <hi>then</hi> learnt to <hi>fight</hi> for Chriſt) but their obedience to any thing <hi>againſt</hi> his Law was not to be commanded (for they had perfectly learn't to <hi>die</hi> for him.)

                     <p>What device then ſhall we ſtudy, or to what fountain ſhall we reduce this ſtrange pretended alteration? Can it enter into our hearts to think, that all the Presbyters and other Chriſtians then, being the Apoſtles Schollers, could be generally ignorant of the Will of Chriſt, touching the neceſſity of a Presbyterial Government? Or, dare we adventure to think them ſo ſtrangely wicked all the World over, as againſt knowledge and conſcience to conſpire againſt it? Imagine the ſpirit of <hi>Diotrephes</hi> had entred into ſome, or a great many of the Presbyters, and poſſeſſed them with an ambitious deſire of a forbidden ſuperiority, was it poſſible they ſhould attempt and atchieve it once without any oppoſition or contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? and beſides, that the contagion of this ambition, ſhould ſpread it ſelf and prevail without ſtop or controul; nay, without any noiſe or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice taken of it, through all the Churches in the World; all the watchmen in the mean time being ſo faſt aſleep, and all the dogs ſo dumb, that not ſo much as one ſhould open his mouth againſt it?</p>

In the mean time, while theſe things remain thus incredible, and, in humane reaſon, impoſſible, I hope I ſhall have leave to conclude thus:</p>
                     <p>Epiſcopal Government is acknowledged to have been univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Church, preſently after the Apoſtles times.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O a diſcourſe upon theſe words, I cannot think of any fitter Introduction, then that wherewith our Saviour ſometime began a Sermon of his, <hi>This day is this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fulfilled.</hi> And I would to God, there were not great occaſion to fear, that a great part of it may be fulfilled in this place.</p>
                  <p>Two things are contained in it. Firſt, the reall wickedneſs of the generality of the men of the Latter-times, in the four firſt verſes. For by <hi>men ſhall be lovers of themſelves, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, boaſters, proud,</hi> &amp;c. I conceive is ment, men generally ſhall be ſo; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe this were nothing peculiar to the laſt, but common to all times: for in all times ſome, nay many, have been lovers of themſelves, covetous, boaſters, proud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, we have here the formal and hypocritical godlineſs of the ſame times, in the laſt verſe, <hi>Having a form of godlineſs, but denying the power thereof;</hi> which latter, ordinarily and naturally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies the former. For, as the ſhadows are longeſt when the Sun is loweſt, and as vines and other fruit-trees bear the leſs fruit, when they are ſuffered to luxuriate and ſpend their ſap upon ſuperfluous ſuckers, and aboundance of leaves: So commonly, we may obſerve both in Civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, where there is great ſtore of formality, there is little ſincerity: and in Religion, where there is a decay of true and cordial piety, there men entertain and pleaſe themſelves, and vainly hope to pleaſe God with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64345:209"/>formalities, and performances, and great ſtore of that righteouſneſs for which Chriſt ſhall judge the world.</p>
                  <p>It were no difficult matter to ſhew that the truth of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s prediction is by experience juſtified in both parts of it; but my purpoſe is to reſtrain my ſelf to the latter, and to endeavour to clear unto you, that that in our times is generally accompliſhed: That almoſt in all places the power of Godlineſs is decayed and vaniſhed; the form and profeſſion of it only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining: That the ſpirit, and ſoul, and life of Religion, is for the moſt part gone; only the outward body or carcaſs, or rather the picture or ſhadow of it being left behind: This is the Doctrin which at this time I ſhall deliver to you; and the Uſe, which I deſire moſt heartily you ſhould make of it, is this, To take care that you confute ſo far as it concerns your particulars, what I fear I ſhall prove too true in the general.</p>
                  <p>To come then to our buſineſs, without further complement, let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine our wayes, and conſider impartially, What the Religion of moſt men is.</p>
                  <p>We are baptized in our infancy, that is, as I conceive, dedicated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to God's ſervice, by our Parents and the Church, as young <hi>Samuel</hi> was by his Mother <hi>Anna,</hi> and there we take a Solemn Vow, <hi>To forſake the Devil and all his works, the vain pomp and glory of the world, with all the covetous deſires of it; to forſake alſo all the carnal deſires of the fleſh, and not to follow nor be led by them.</hi> This vow we take when we be children and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it not: and, How many are there, who know, and conſider, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what they have vowed, when they are become men, almoſt as little as they did being children: Conſider the lives, and publique actions of moſt men of all conditions, in Court, City, and Country, and then deny it, if you can, that thoſe three things which we have renounced in our Baptiſm; the profits, honours, and pleaſures of the World, are not the very Gods which divide the world amongſt them, are not ſerved more devoutly, confided in more heartily, loved more affectionately, then the <hi>Father, Son, and hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Ghoſt,</hi> in whoſe name we are baptized? deny, if you can, the dayly and conſtant imployment of all men, to be either a violent proſecution of the vain pomp and glory of the world, or of the power, riches, and contemptible profits of it, or of the momentary or unſatisfying pleaſures of the fleſh, or elſe of the more diabolical humours of pride, malice, revenge, and ſuch like: and yet with this empty form we pleaſe and ſatisfie our ſelves, as well as if we were lively born again by the Spirit of God, not knowing or not regarding what St. <hi>Peter</hi> hath taught us, That the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> which muſt ſave us, is, <hi>Not the putting away of the filth of the fleſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.21.</note> 
                     <hi>but the anſwer of a good conſcience unto God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we are come to years capable of inſtruction, many, which is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable to conſider, are ſo little regarded by themſelves or others, that they continue little better then Pagans in a Common-wealth of Chriſtians, and know little more of God or of Chriſt, then if they had been bred in the Indies. A lamentable caſe, and which will one day lye heavy upon their account, which might have amended it and did not. But many, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, are taught to act over this play of Religion, and learned to ſay, <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which art in Heaven;</hi> and, <hi>I believe in God the Father Almighty:</hi> but, Where are the men that live ſo, as if they did believe in earneſt, that God is their Almighty Father? Where are they that fear him, and truſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64345:209"/>him, and depend upon him only, for their whole happineſs, and love him, and obey him, as in reaſon we ought to do to an Almighty Father? Who, if he be our Father, and we be indeed his children, will do for us all the good he can; and if he be Almighty, can do for us all the good he will; and yet, how few are there, who love him with half that affection as children uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do their Parents, or believe him with half that ſimplicity, or ſerve him with half that diligence? And then for the Lords Prayer, the plain truth is, we lye unto God for the moſt part clean through it, and for want of deſiring indeed, what in word we pray for, tell him to his face as many falſe tales as we make Petitions. For who ſhews by his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, that he deſires heartily that <hi>God's name ſhould be hallowed;</hi> that is, holily and religiouſly worſhipped and adored by all men? That <hi>his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould be advanced and inlarged? That his bleſſed will ſhould be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally obeyed?</hi> Who ſhews by his forſaking ſin, that he deſires ſo much as he ſhould do the forgiveneſs of it? Nay who doth not revenge, upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the affronts, contempts, and injuries put upon him, and ſo upon the matter curſe himſelf, as oft as he ſayes, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſses as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us?</hi> How few depend upon God only for their <hi>dayly bread, viz.</hi> the good things of this life, as upon the only giver of them, ſo as neither to get nor keep any of them, by any means which they know or fear to be offenſive unto God? How few deſire in earneſt to <hi>avoid temptation?</hi> Nay, who almoſt is there, that takes not the Devils Office out of his hand, and is not himſelf a tempter both to himſelf and others? Laſtly, who almoſt is there that deſires heartily and above all things ſo much as the thing deſerves, to be delivered from the <hi>greateſt evill,</hi> Sin, I mean, and the Anger of God? Now, beloved, this is certain; he that imployes not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite induſtry, to obtain what he pretends to deſire, does not deſire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but only pretends to do ſo: He that deſires not what he prayes for, prayes with tongue only, and not with his heart, indeed does not pray to God, but play and dally with him. And yet this is all which men generally do, and therefore herein alſo accompliſh this prophecy, <hi>Having a form of godlineſs, but denying the power thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this were ill enough, were it in private, but we abuſe God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty alſo with our publick and ſolemn formalities, we make the Church a Stage whereon to act our parts, and play our Pageants; there we make a profeſſion every day of <hi>confeſsing our ſins with humble; lowly, and obedient hearts,</hi> and yet when we have talked after this manner, 20, 30, 40, years together, our hearts for the moſt part continue as proud, as impenitent, as diſobedient, as they were in the beginning. We make great Proteſtations, <hi>when we aſſemble and meet together to render thanks to God Almighty, for the benefits received at his hands;</hi> and if this were to be performed with words, with <hi>Hoſanna's,</hi> and <hi>Hallelujahs,</hi> and <hi>Gloria Patri's</hi> and Pſalms and Hymns, and ſuch like outward matters, peradventure we ſhould do it very ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently: but in the mean time with our lives and actions, we provoke the Almighty, and that to his face, with all variety of grievous and bitter provocations; we do dayly and hourly ſuch things as we know, and he hath aſſured us, to be odious unto him, and contrary to his nature; as any thing in the world is to the nature of any man in the world; and all this upon poor, trifling, trivial, no temptations. If a man whom you had dealt well with, ſhould deal ſo with you; one whom ye had
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64345:210" rendition="simple:additions"/>redeemed from the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> ſlavery, and inſtated in ſome indifferent good inheritance, ſhould make you fine Speeches, entertain you with Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, and have your prayſes alwayes in your mouth; but all this while do nothing that pleaſes you, but upon all occaſions, put all affronts and indignities upon you, Would you ſay, this were a thankful man? Nay, would you not make heaven and earth ring of his unthankfulneſs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt him almoſt as much for his fair ſpeeches, as his foul actions. Beloved, ſuch is our unthankfulneſs to our God and Creatour, to our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; our tongues ingeminate, and cry aloud <hi>Hoſanna, Hoſanna,</hi> but the lowder voice of our lives and actions is <hi>Crucifie him, Crucifie him:</hi> We Court God Almighty, and complement with him, and profeſs to eſteem his ſervice <hi>perfect freedome;</hi> but if any thing be to be done, much more if any thing be to be ſuffered for him, here we leave him. We bow the knee before him, and put a reed in his hand, and a Crown upon his head, and cry, <hi>Hail King of the Jews:</hi> But then with our cuſtomary ſins, we give him gall to eat, and vinegar to drink, we thruſt a ſpear in his ſide, nail him to the Croſs, and crucifie to our ſelves the Lord of Glory. This is not the office of a friend to bewail a dead friend with vain lamentation. <hi>Sed quae voluerit meminiſſe, quae mandaverit exequi,</hi> to remember what he deſires, and execute what he commands; ſo ſaid a dying <hi>Roman</hi> to his friend, and ſo ſay I to you, To be thankful to God is not to ſay, God be prayſed, or, God be thanked, but to remember what he deſires, and execute what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. To be thankful to God, is certainly to love him, and to love him is to keep his Commandements, ſo ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandements:</hi> If we do ſo, we may juſtly pretend to thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; which, believe me, is not a word, nor to be performed with words; But if we do not ſo, as general y we do not, our talk of thankfulneſs is nothing elſe but meer talk; and we accompliſh Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> propheſie here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alſo: Having a form of thankfulneſs, but not the reality, not the power of it.</p>
                  <p>If I ſhould reckon up unto you, how many direct lies every wicked man tels to God Almighty, as often as he ſayes Amen, <hi>to this form of godlineſs,</hi> which our Church hath preſcribed; If I ſhould preſent unto you all our acting of Piety, and playing of Humiliation, and perſonating of devotion in the Pſalms, the Letanies, the Collects, and generally in the whole Service, I ſhould be infinite: And therefore I have thought good to draw a vail over a great part of our Hypocriſie, and to reſtrain the remainder of our diſcourſe to the contrariety between our profeſſion and performance, only in two things, I mean, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And firſt for <hi>Faith:</hi> We profeſs, and indeed generally, becauſe it is not ſafe to do otherwiſe, that we believe the Scripture to be true, and that it contains the plain and only way to infinite and eternal happineſs: But if we did generally believe what we do profeſs, if this were the language of our hearts as well as our tongues, How comes it to paſs that the Study of it is ſo generally neglected?</p>
                  <p>Let a book that treats of the Philoſophers ſtone, promiſe never ſo many mountains of gold, and even the reſtoring of the golden age again, yet were it not marvail, if few ſhould ſtudy it; and the reaſon is, becauſe few would believe it. But if there were a book extant, and ordinary to be had, as the Bible is, which men did generally believe to contain a plain
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64345:210"/>and eaſie way for all men to become rich, and to live in health and pleaſure, and this worlds happineſs, can any man imagine that this book would be unſtudied by any man? and why then ſhould I not believe, That if the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were firmly and heartily believed, the certain and only way to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is perfect and eternal, it would be ſtudied by all men with all diligence? Seeing therefore moſt Chriſtians are ſo cold and negligent in the ſtudy of it, preferr all other buſineſs, all other pleaſures before it; is there not great reaſon to fear, that many who pretend to believe firmly, believe it not at all, or very weakly and faintly? If the General of an Army, or an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour to ſome Prince or State, were aſſured by the King his Maſter, that the tranſgreſſing any point of his Commiſſion, ſhould coſt him his life; and the exact performance of it, be recompenced with as high a reward as were in the Kings power to beſtow upon him: can it be imagined that any man who believes this, and is in his right mind, can be ſo ſupinely and ſtudiply negligent of this charge, which ſo much imports him, as to overſee, through want of care, any one neceſſary Article, or part of his Commiſsion; eſpecially if it be delivered to him in writing, and at his pleaſure to peruſe it every day? Certainly this abſurd negligence is a thing without example, and ſuch as peradventure will never happen to any ſober man to the worlds end: And by the ſame reaſon, if we were firmly perſwaded, that this Book doth indeed contain that charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, which infinitely more concerns us, it were not in reaſon poſsible, but that to ſuch a perſwaſion, our care and diligence about it, ſhould be in ſome meaſure anſwerable: ſeeing therefore moſt of us are ſo ſtrangely careleſs, ſo groſly negligent of it, is there not great reaſon to fear, that though we have <hi>profeſſors and proteſtors</hi> in aboundance; yet the faithful, the truly and ſincerely faithful, are, in a manner, failed from the children of men. What but this can be the cauſe that men are ſo commonly ignorant of ſo many articles, and particular mandates of it, which yet are as manifeſt in it, as if they were written with the beams of the Sun? For example; how few of our Ladies and Gentlewomen, do or will underſtand, that a voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life, is damnable and prohibited to them? Yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith ſo very plainly, <hi>She that liveth in pleaſure is dead while ſhe liveth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.6.</note> I believe this caſe divinely regards not the Sex, He would ſay, <hi>He</hi> as well as <hi>She,</hi> if there had been occaſion. How few of the Gallants of our time do or will underſtand, that it is not lawful for them to be as expenſive and coſtly in apparel, as their means, or perhaps, their credit will extend unto? which is to ſacrifice unto vanity, that, which by the law of Chriſt, is due unto Charity; and yet the ſame St. <hi>Paul</hi> forbids plainly this exceſs even to women—<hi>alſo let women</hi> (he would have ſaid it much rather to the men) <hi>array themſelves in comely apparel, with ſhamefaſtneſs and modeſty, not with embroidered hair,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.3.</note> 
                     <hi>or gold, or pearls, or coſtly apparel;</hi> and to make our ignorance the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, the very ſame rule is delivered by St. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3.3.</p>
                  <p>How few rich men are or will be perſwaded, That the law of Chriſt permits them not to heap up riches for ever, nor perpetually to add houſe to houſe, and land to land, though by lawful means, but requires of them thus much Charity at leaſt, that ever while they are providing for their Wives and Children, they ſhould, out of the increaſe wherewith God bleſſeth their induſtry, allot the Poor a juſt and free proportion? and when they have provided for them in a convenient manner, (ſuch as they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64345:211"/>themſelves ſhall judge ſufficient and convenient in others) that then they ſhould give over making purchaſe after purchaſe, but, with the ſurpluſſage of their revenue beyond their expence, procure, as much as lies in them, that no Chriſtian remain miſerably poor: few rich men, I fear, are or will be thus perſwaded, and their dayly actions ſhew as much; yet undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, either our Saviour's general command, <hi>of loving our neighbours as our ſelves,</hi> which can hardly conſiſt with our keeping vainly, or ſpending vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what he wants for his ordinary ſubſiſtence, layes upon us a neceſſity of this high liberality: or his ſpecial command concerning this matter, <hi>Quod ſupereſt date pauperibus; That which remains give to the poor:</hi> or that which St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3.17. reacheth home unto it, <hi>Whoſoever hath this worlds good, and ſeeth his brother have need, and ſhutteth up the bowels of his compaſsion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> which is in effect, as if he had ſaid, He that keepeth from any brother in Chriſt, that which his brother wants, and he wants not, doth but vainly think that he loves God, and therefore vainly hope that God loves him.</p>
                  <p>Where almoſt are the men that are or will be perſwaded the Goſpel of Chriſt requires of men <hi>Humility,</hi> like to that of <hi>little Children,</hi> and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the higheſt pain of damnation? That is, that we ſhould no more over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value our ſelves, or deſire to be highly eſteemed by others; no more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value, ſcorn, or deſpiſe others; no more affect preeminence over others, then little children do, before we have put that pride into them, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards we charge wholly upon their natural corruption: and yet our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour requires nothing more rigidly, nor more plainly, than this high degree of humility; <hi>Verily,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I ſay unto you</hi> (he ſpeaks to his Diſciples affecting high places, and demanding, which of them ſhould be greateſt) <hi>Except ye be converted and become as little Children, ye ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Would it not be ſtrange news to a great many, that not only <hi>adultery</hi> and <hi>fornication,</hi> but even <hi>uncleanneſs</hi> and <hi>laſciviouſneſs;</hi> not only <hi>idolatry</hi> and <hi>witchcraft,</hi> but <hi>hatred, variance, emulations, wrath</hi> and <hi>contentions;</hi> not only <hi>murthers,</hi> but <hi>envying;</hi> not <hi>drunkenneſs</hi> only, but <hi>revelling,</hi> are things prohibited to Chriſtians, and ſuch as if we forſake them not, we cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of Heaven? and yet theſe things, as ſtrange as they may ſeem, are plainly written; ſome of them by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 4. <hi>Ch.</hi> but all of them by St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Now the works of the fleſh are manifeſt, which are theſe, adultery, fornication, uncleanneſs, laſciviouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of the which I tell you before, as I have told you in times paſt, that they who do ſuch things, ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If I ſhould tell you, that all <hi>bitterneſs</hi> and <hi>evill ſpeaking</hi> (nay ſuch is the modeſty and gravity which Chriſtianity requires of us) <hi>fooliſh talk and je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,</hi> are things not allowed to Chriſtians, would not many cry out, Theſe are hard and ſtrange ſayings, who can hear them? and yet, as ſtrange as they may ſeem, they have been written well nigh 1600 years, and are yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in very legible Characters, in the Epiſt. to the <hi>Eph.</hi> the end of the 4 and the beginning of the 5 chap.</p>
                  <p>To come a little nearer to the buſineſs of our times, The chief Actours in this bloudy Tragedy, which is now upon the Stage, who have robb'd our Soveraign Lord the King of his Forts, Towns, Treaſure, Ammunition, Houſes, of the Perſons of many of his Subjects, and (as much as lies in them)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64345:211"/>of the hearts of all of them: Is it credible that they know, and remember, and conſider the example of <hi>David</hi> recorded for their inſtruction? <hi>Whoſe heart ſmote him when he had but cut off the hem of Sauls garment.</hi>

Undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, if they did know and conſider, and lay cloſe to their hearts, theſe places of Scripture; or the fearful judgment which befel <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> for this very ſin which now they commit, and with a high hand ſtill proceed in, it would be impoſſible but their hearts would ſmite them, as <hi>David</hi>'s did, upon an infinitely leſs occaſion, and affright them out of thoſe wayes of preſent confuſion, and eternal damnation. And then on the other ſide, they that maintain the Kings righteous cauſe with the hazzard of their lives and fortunes, but by their oaths and curſes, by their drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and debauchery, by their irreligion and prophanneſs, fight more powerfully againſt their party, then by all other means they do or can fight for it; are not, I fear, very well acquainted with any part of the Bible: but, that ſtrict caution which properly concerns themſelves, in the Book of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> I much doubt they have ſcarce ever heard of it, <hi>When thou goeſt to warr with thine Enemies, then take heed there be no wicked thing in thee;</hi> not only no wickedneſs in the cauſe thou maintaineſt, nor no wickedneſs in the means by which thou maintaineſt it; but no perſonal impieties in the perſons that maintain it. Beloved, for the former two, we have reaſon to be full of comfort and confidence; For, what is our cauſe? what is that which you fight, and we pray for? but to deliver the King and all his good Subjects out of the power of their Enemies, who will have no peace but with their ſlaves and vaſſals: and for the means by which it is maintained, it is not by lying, it is not by calumnies, it is not by running firſt our ſelves, and then forcing the people to univerſal perjury? but by a juſt warr, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe neceſſary; and by as fair and merciful a warr, as if they were not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and Traytors you fight againſt, but Competitours in a doubtful Title. But now for the third part of the caution, that, to deal ingenuouſly with you,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64345:212"/>and to deliver my own ſoul, if I cannot other mens, that I cannot think of with half ſo much comfort as the former; but ſeeing ſo many <hi>Jonaſſes</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued in the ſame ſhip, the ſame cauſe with us, and ſo many <hi>Achans</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into Battle with us againſt the <hi>Cananites;</hi> ſeeing Publicans and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners on the one ſide, againſt Scribes and Phariſees on the other; on the one ſide Hypocriſie, on the other Prophaneſs; no honeſty nor juſtice on the one ſide, and very little piety on the other: On the one ſide horrible oaths, curſes, and blaſphemies; on the other, peſtilent lies, calumnies, and perjury: When I ſee amongſt them the pretence of Reformation, if not the deſire, purſued by Antichriſtian, Mahumetan, Devilliſh means; and amongſt us little or no zeal for Reformation of what is indeed amiſs, little or no care to remove the cauſe of God's anger towards us, by juſt, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and Chriſtian means; I profeſs plainly, I cannot without trembling conſider, what is likely to be the event of theſe Diſtractions; I cannot but fear, that the goodneſs of our cauſe, may ſink under the burthen of our ſins: And that God in his juſtice, becauſe we will not ſuffer his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to atchieve their prime ſcope and intention, which is our amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reformation, may either deliver us up to the blind zeal and fury of our Enemies; or elſe, which I rather fear, make us inſtruments of his Juſtice each againſt other, and of our own juſt and deſerved confuſion. This, I profeſs plainly, is my fear, and I would to God it were the fear of every Souldier of his Majeſties Army: but that which encreaſeth my fear is, that I ſee very many of them have very little or none at all: I mean not, that they are fearleſs towards their Enemies, (that's our joy and triumph) but that they ſhew their courage even againſt God, and fear not him, whom it is madneſs not to fear. Now from whence can their not fearing Him proceed, but from their not knowing him, their not knowing his will and their own duty? not knowing how highly it concerns Souldiers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove other profeſsions, to be Religious; and then, if ever, when they are engaged in dangerous adventures, and every moment have their lives in their hands. <hi>When they go to warr with their Enemies, then to take heed there be no wicked thing in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee, Beloved, how many inſtances and examples I have given you of our groſs ignorance of what is neceſſary and eaſie for us to know; and to theſe, it were no difficult matter to add more. Now from whence can this ignorance proceed, but from ſupine negligence? and from whence this negligence, but from our not believing what we pretend to believe? For, did we believe firmly and heartily, that this Book were given us by God for the rule of our Actions, and that obedience to it were the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and only way to eternal happineſs, it were impoſsible we ſhould be ſuch enemies to our ſelves, ſuch Traytors to our own ſouls, as not to ſearch it, at leaſt, with ſo much diligence, that no neceſſary point of our duty plainly taught in it, could poſsibly eſcape us. But it is certain, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to all the world, that the greateſt part of Chriſtians, through groſs and wilful negligence, remain utterly ignorant of many neceſſary points of their duty to God and Man: and therefore it is much to be feared, that this Book, and the Religion of Chriſt contained in it, among an infinite of profeſſours, labours with great penury of true believers.</p>
                  <p>It were an eaſie matter (if the time would permit) to preſent unto you many other demonſtrations of the ſame concluſion; but to this drawn
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64345:212"/>from our willing ignorance of that which is eaſie and neceſſary for us to know, I will content my ſelf to add only one more, taken from our volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and preſumptuous neglect to do thoſe things which we know and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>If a man ſhould ſay unto me, That it concerns him as much as his life is worth, to go preſently to ſuch a place, and that he knows but one way to it, and I ſhould ſee him ſtand ſtill or go ſome other way, Had I any reaſon to believe that this man believes himſelf? <hi>Quid Verba audiam, cum facta videam?</hi> ſaith he in the Comedy; <hi>Proteſtatio contra factum non valet,</hi> ſaith the Law; and why ſhould I believe, that that man believes obedience to Chriſt the only way to preſent and eternal happineſs, whom I ſee witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and willingly, and conſtantly, and cuſtomarily to diſobay him? The time was, that we all knew that the King could reward thoſe that did him ſervice, and puniſh thoſe that did him diſ-ſervice, and then all men were ready to obey his Command, and he was a rare man that durſt do any thing to his face that offended him. Beloved, if we did but believe in God, ſo much as moſt Subjects do in their King; did we as verily believe, that God could and would make us perfectly happy, if we ſerve him, though all the world conſpire to make us miſerable, and that he could and would make us miſerable if we ſerve him not, though all the world ſhould conſpire to to make us happy, How were it poſſible that to ſuch a faith our lives ſhould not be conformable? Who was there ever ſo madly in love with a preſent penny, as to run the leaſt hazard of the loſs of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> a year to gain it, or not readily to part with it upon any probable hope or light perſwaſion, much more a firm belief that by doing ſo he ſhould gain 100000 <hi>l.</hi> Now, beloved, the happineſs which the ſervants of Chriſt are promiſed in the Scripture, we all pretend to believe, that it exceeds the conjunction of all the good things of the world, and much more ſuch a portion as we may poſſibly enjoy, infinitly more then 10000 <hi>l.</hi> a year, or 100000 <hi>l.</hi> doth a penny; for, 100000 <hi>l.</hi> is but a penny ſo many times over, and 10000 <hi>l.</hi> a year is worth but a certain number of pence; but between heaven and earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween finite and infinite, between eternity and a moment, there is utterly no proportion; and therefore ſeeing we are ſo apt, upon trifling occaſions, to hazard this heaven for this earth, this infinite for this finite, this all for this nothing; is it not much to be feared, that though many of us pretend to much faith, we have indeed very little or none at all? The ſum of all which hath been ſpoken concerning this point is this: Were we firmly perſwaded, that obedience to the Goſpel of Chriſt, is the true and only way to preſent and eternal happineſs, (without which faith, no man living can be juſtified) then the innate deſire of our own happineſs could not but make us ſtudious inquirers of the will of Chriſt, and conſcionable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers of it; but there are (as experience ſhews) very few, who make it their care and buſineſs to know the will of Chriſt; and of thoſe few again, very many who make no conſcience at all of doing what they know: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though they profeſs and proteſt they have faith, yet their proteſtations are not to be regarded againſt their actions, but we may ſafely and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conclude what was to be concluded, That the Doctrin of Chriſt, amongſt an infinite of profeſſors, labours with great ſcarcity of true, and ſerious, and hearty believers; and that herein alſo we accompliſh St. <hi>Pauls</hi> predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Having a form of godlineſs, but denying,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:64345:213"/>
But perhaps the truth and reality of our repentance may make ſome kind of ſatisfaction to God Almighty for our hypocritical dallying with him in all the reſt; truly, I ſhould be heartily glad it were ſo: but I am ſo far from being of this faith, that herein I fear we are moſt of all hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical, and that the generality of profeſſors is ſo far from a reall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of true Repentance, that ſcarce one in an hundred underſtands truly what it is.</p>
                  <p>Some ſatisfie themſelves with a bare confeſſion and acknowledgement either that they are ſinners in general, or that they have committed ſuch and ſuch ſins in particular; which acknowledgement comes not yet from the heart of a great many, but only from their lips and tongues: For how many are there that do rather complain and murmure that they are ſinners, then acknowledge and confeſs it? and make it, upon the matter, rather their unhappineſs and misfortune, then their true fault, that they are ſo? Such are all they who impute all their commiſſions of evil to the unavoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able want of <hi>reſtraining grace,</hi> and all their omiſſion of good to the like want of <hi>effectual exciting grace.</hi> All ſuch as pretend that the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God are impoſſible to be kept any better then they are kept; and that the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, are even omnipotent enemies; and that God neither doth, nor will, give ſufficient ſtrength to reſiſt and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome them. All ſuch as lay all their faults upon <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſay with thoſe rebellious <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (whom God aſſures, That they neither had nor ſhould have juſt reaſon to ſay ſo) <hi>That their Fathers had eaten ſowr grapes, and their teeth were ſet on edge.</hi> Laſtly, all ſuch as lay all their ſins upon <hi>divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> and <hi>predeſtination,</hi> ſaying with their tongues, O what wretched ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have we been; but in their hearts, How could we help it, we were predeſtinate to it, we could not do otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>All ſuch as ſeriouſly ſo perſuade themſelves, and think to hide their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with ſuch fig-leaves as theſe, can no more be ſaid to acknowledg them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guilty of a fault, then a man that was born blind or lame, with the Stone or Gout, can accuſe himſelf of any fault for being born ſo; well may ſuch a one complain and bemone himſelf, and ſay, O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this unhappineſs! but ſuch a complaint is as farr from being a true acknowledgement of any fault, as a bare acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of a fault is farr from true repentance: for, to confeſs a fault, is, to acknowledge, that, freely and willingly, without any conſtraint, or unavoydable neceſſity, we have tranſgreſſed the law of God, it being <hi>in our power by God's grace,</hi> to have done otherwiſe. To aggravate this fault is to confeſs we have done ſo, when we might eaſily have avoyded it, and had no great nor violent temptation to it; to pretend any great difficulty in the matter, is to excuſe and extenuate it: but to ſay, that, all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, it was abſolutely impoſſible for you to avoid it, is flatly to deny it. Others there are that think they have done enough, if to confeſſion of ſin, they add ſome ſorrow for it; if when the preſent fit of ſin is paſt, and they are returned to themſelves, the ſting remaining, breed ſome remorſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſome complaints againſt their wickedneſs and folly for having done ſo, and ſome intentions to forſake it, though vaniſhing and ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual: Theſe heat-drops, this morning dew of ſorrow, though it preſently vaniſh, and they return to their ſin again upon the next temptation <hi>as a dogg to his vomit,</hi> when the pang is over; yet in the pauſes between,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64345:213"/>while they are in their good mood, they conceive themſelves to have very true, and very good repentance; ſo that if they ſhould have the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to be taken away in one of theſe <hi>Intervalla,</hi> one of theſe ſober moods, they ſhould certainly be ſaved; which is juſt as if a man in a Quartane Ague, or the Stone, or Gout, ſhould think himſelf rid of his diſeaſe as oft as he is out of his fit.</p>
                  <p>But if repentance were no more but ſo; how could St. <hi>Paul</hi> have truly ſaid, <hi>That godly ſorrow worketh repentance?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.10.</note> Every man knows that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can work it ſelf. The Architect is not the houſe which he builds, the Father is not the Son which he begets, the Tradeſman is not the work which he makes; and therefore if ſorrow, godly ſorrow, worketh repentance, certainly ſorrow is not repentance: the ſame St. <hi>Paul</hi> tels us in the ſame place, <hi>That the ſorrow of the world worketh death;</hi> and you will give me leave to conclude from hence, therefore it is not death; and what ſhall hinder me from concluding thus alſo, Godly ſorrow worketh repentance, therefore it is not repentance.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe it is worth the obſerving, that when the Scripture ſpeaks of that kind of repentance, which is only ſorrow for ſomething done, and wiſhing it undone, it conſtantly uſeth the word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64345:214"/>heaven and hell, ſhould fail of the performing it: but this work of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, keeping, and doing, is (though not impoſſible by extraordinary mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be performed at laſt) yet ordinarily a work of time, a long and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious work (but yet heaven is very well worth it) and if you mean to go through with it, you had need go about it preſently. Yet ſeeing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of our Liturgy thought fit to abreviate, <hi>Turning from all ſin, and keeping all God's Statutes, and doing that which is lawful and right,</hi> into this one word, <hi>Repenting,</hi> it is eaſie and obvious to collect from hence, as I did before, from the other place, that by Repentance, they underſtood not only ſorrow for ſin, but converſion from it.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64345:214"/>of which yet we are come very ſhort: but it was alſo, and that chiefly, their univerſal turning from their evil way, which above all the reſt was preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and effectual with God Almighty: for ſo it is written, <hi>And God ſaw their works that they turned from their evil way, and God repented him of the evil that he ſayed he would do, and he did it not.</hi>

                  <p>And now what remains, but that (as I ſaid in the beginning) I ſhould humbly intreat, and earneſtly exhort every man that hath heard me this day, to confute in his particular, what I have proved true in the general;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64345:216"/>To take care that the ſin of formality, though it be the ſin of our times, may yet not be the ſin of our perſons, that we ſatisfie not our ſelves with the ſhadows of Religion, without the ſubſtance of it, nor with the <hi>form of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> without the <hi>power</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe I ſhall beſeech you to conſider, That though ſacrificing, burning incenſe, celebrating of ſet feſtivals, praying, faſting, and ſuch like, were, under the Law, the ſervice of God commanded by himſelf; yet whenſoever they proceed not from, nor were joyned with, the ſincerity of an honeſt heart; he profeſſeth frequently almoſt in all the Prophets, not only his ſcorn and contempt of them all, as fond, empty, and ridiculous; but alſo his hating, loathing, and deteſting of them as abominable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious.</p>

In the next place, let me intreat you to conſider the fearful judgement which God hath particularly threatned to this very ſin of <hi>Drawing nigh unto him with our lips, when our hearts are farr from him:</hi> It is the great judgement of being given over to <hi>the ſpirii of ſlumber and ſecurity,</hi> the uſual forerunner of ſpeedy deſolation and deſtruction, as we may ſee in the 29 <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> from the 9 to the 14 verſ. <hi>Stay your ſelves and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, cry ye out, and cry, They are drunken but not with wine, they ſtagger but not with ſtrong drink: for the Lord hath powred out upon you the ſpirit of deep ſleep, and hath cloſed your eyes.

For, if the ſpirit of <hi>deep ſleep</hi> were not upon us, How could we ſleep ſo ſecurely even upon the brink of the pit of perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? How could we proceed on ſo confidently in our mirth and jollity, nay, in our crying ſins and horrible impieties; now when the hand of God is upon us, and wrath is gone out and even ready to conſume us? and if the wiſdom of our Wiſe-men were not periſhed, How were it poſſible they ſhould ſo obſtinately refuſe the ſecurity offered of our Laws, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Religion, by the King's Oath, by his Execrations on himſelf, and his poſterity, in caſe he ſhould violate it; by the Oaths of all his Miniſters not to conſent to, or be inſtruments in, ſuch a Violation; by the ſo much deſired <hi>Triennial Parliament,</hi> from which no tranſgreſſor can poſſibly be ſecure; and inſtead of all this ſecurity, ſeek for it by a Civil Warr, the continuance whereof, muſt bring us to deſtruction and deſolation, or elſe He hath deceived us by whom we are taught, <hi>That a Kingdom divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it ſelf cannot ſtand.</hi>

                  <p>Now what was the ſin which provoked this fearful judgement? What but that which I have laboured to convince you of, and to diſſwade you from, even the ſin of Hypocriſie; as we may ſee at the 12 verſe, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Lord, for as much as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have removed their heart farr from me; and their fear toward me is taught by the precepts of men: therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work amongſt them; for the wiſdom of their Wiſe-men ſhall periſh,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

The words now read, are a ſecret confeſſion which the Fool whiſpers to his own heart: He neither can nor dare profeſs this openly, and when he cals his reaſon to counſel about this buſineſs, the queſtion is farr otherwiſe ſtated. The words do not run thus, The Fool being convinced by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of reaſon and demonſtration, hath concluded, There is no God; no, this is no Heatheniſh Philoſophical fool, he is quite of another temper: This is a worldly, proud, malitious, projecting wiſe fool, a fool that knows it is for his advantage to put God out of his thoughts; and therefore doth forcibly captivate, and wilfully hoodwink his underſtanding, and thinks he hath obtained a great victory, if he can contrive any courſe to bring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to that paſs, that no cold melancholy thoughts of God or Hell, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt or reſtrain him from freely wallowing in the luſts and uncleanneſs of his heart, without any remôrſe, without any reluctance or griping with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him. It is for his Heart's ſake, the love that he bears to the luſts thereof, that makes him an Atheiſt: If it could ſtand with that courſe and trade of life that he is reſolved upon, to entertain contrary thoughts, he would as ſoon work his judgment and thoughts another way. And therefore in his open profeſſion, it ſometimes fals out, that even when he wiſhes there were no God, yet he is a very forward zealous acknowledger in general of God and his glorious Attributes: So that the ſame deſire of a quiet and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted enjoying the ſcope and freedom of the luſts and affections of his heart, makes him both a reſolute ſecret Atheiſt, and withal wiſe enough to keep his folly to himſelf, and to make none elſe acquainted with his curious art and method of ſuch woful ſelf-deceiving, but his dearly beloved Heart. <hi>The Fool,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

And yet this was a temptation ſtrong enough for Paradiſe; for juſt ſo did the Devil entrap <hi>Adam</hi> at the firſt; ſo that, in him, we have received one foil already, at this weapon: And he proceeds dayly, in acting that over again: For what was it which deſtroyed <hi>Adam,</hi> but the preferring of the Tree of Knowledg, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Tree of Life?</p>

Alas, What could the poor people think, when they heard their Doctors, and Magiſtrates, (men that were gods to them, that ſate in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair), condemned of ſuch extream folly and indiſcretion?

                  <p n="27">27. Certain it was, There were many poor ſouls, whom the Phariſees kept out of Heaven for company. Our Saviour tells them ſo much; <hi>Ye neither go into Heaven your ſelves, nor ſuffer others to go in:</hi> But they were ſuch as they had infected with their Leaven: Such as made thoſe rotten ſuperſtructions, which thoſe great Doctors built upon the Word, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of their Faith and Hope: And as certain it is, that many there were, upon whom God out of his gracious favour and mercy, had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed ſuch piercing brains, and enquiring heads, as to make them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their dangerous Opinions and Traditions. They were ſuch as made better uſe of that little knowledg they had, than to vent it in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, or in maintaining Opinions and Tenents againſt the Church. They heard the Word with an humble honeſt heart, ſubmitting themſelves wholly to it, and reſtored their Faith to its proper ſeat, the Heart and Affections, and it was fruitful in their lives and practiſe. The wiſdom of <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf, as long as he gave himſelf to Idolarty, and Luxury, was folly and madneſs, to the diſcretion and prudence of theſe poor deſpiſed people.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. Thus you ſee, The Fool, that in my Text, is ſo madd, as to ſay, <hi>There is no God,</hi> may have wit enough to underſtand more; nay, in the

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Latin</hi> Tranſlation following St. <hi>Paul,</hi> might more ſignificantly have ſtyled him <hi>Imprudens,</hi> than <hi>Inſipiens.</hi> For the wiſdom which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Godlineſs, doth moſt exactly anſwer to that Prudence which moral Philoſophers make a general over-ruling Vertue, to give bounds and limits to all our Actions, and to find out a temper and mean wherein we ought to walk: And therefore a moſt learned Divine, of our Church, yet alive, knew very well what he ſaid, when he deſin'd our Faith to be <hi>A ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Prudence;</hi> Implying, that Faith bears the ſame office and ſway in the life and practiſe of a Chriſtian, as Prudence of a moral honeſt man.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Now, ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> there may be many intemperate, youthful, diſſolute ſpirits, which may have an admirable, piercing, diſcerning judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſpeculative Sciences, as the Mathematicks, Metaphyſicks, and the like; becauſe the dwelling upon ſuch contemplations, does not at all croſs, or trouble, thoſe rude untamed paſſions and affections of theirs: yea they may be cunning in the ſpeculative knowledg of vertues: But all this while they are notwithſtanding utterly, invincibly, imprudent; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Prudence requires not only a good diſcerning judgment and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, but a ſerenity and calmneſs in the paſſions.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. Therefore the ſame Philoſopher does worthily reprehend ſome An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, who called all vertues, Sciences; and ſaid, that each particular ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue was a ſeveral Art: requiring only an enlightning or informing of the Reaſon, and Underſtanding, which any, for a little coſt and ſmall pains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking in frequenting the learned Lectures of Philoſophers, need not doubt but eaſily to obtain.</p>

This conceit, of ſo learned a man, does very well deſerve our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution: And it will not be at all ſwerving from the buſineſs in hand: Therefore I ſhall ſhew you, how the Moraliſt by the force of natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, hath framed to himſelf a Divinity and Religion, reſembling, both in method and many ſubſtantial parts, the glorious learning of a Chriſtian. I told you the fore-named Doctor did very well to call our Faith, or Aſſent to ſupernatural Myſteries, <hi>A ſpiritual Prudence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="32">32. Now beſides moral prudence, nay, before the moraliſt can make any uſe thereof, or exerciſe it in the work of any vertue, there is required another general Vertue, which the Philoſopher calls Univerſal Juſtice, which is nothing elſe, but a ſobriety and temper in the affections, whereby they are ſubdued and captiv'd unto well inform'd Reaſon. So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it commands to be done, there is no rebellion, no unwillingneſs in the Paſſions, but they proceed readily to execution, though it be never ſo diſtaſteful to ſenſe.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. Now how well does this expreſs the nature of Charity: for, What elſe is Love, but a ſweet breathing of the Holy Spirit upon our Paſſions, whereby the Holy Ghoſt does, as it did in the beginning of <hi>Geneſis, incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare aquis,</hi> move by a cheriſhing, quieting vertue, upon the Sea of our Paſſions? Did not the ſame Spirit come to <hi>Eliah</hi> in a ſoft whiſper? He walks not <hi>in Turbine,</hi> in a ſtrong wind to raiſe a Tempeſt in our Affections. Now when we have received this <hi>ipſiſsiman Dei particulam,</hi> (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid of the Soul) this ſhred or portion of the Holy Spirit, which is Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, how evenly and temperately do we behave our ſelves to God, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64345:222"/>all the world beſides? How willingly and obediently do we ſubmit our ſelves to the performance of whatſoever Faith, out of Gods Word, doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn us?</p>
                  <p n="34">34. But yet the Analogy and proportion between theſe two is more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and obſervable: That Univerſal Juſtice is no particular ſingular vertue, neither hath it any particular ſingular object. (As other vertues have; For example, Temperance, or Abſtinence, which hath to do with ſenſual delights and pleaſures, and none elſe.) But when it is determined to, and faſtens on, the object of a particular vertue, it is converted into, and incorporates with that very vertue: for example, If I do exerciſe this general Habit of obſerving a mean and temper, in things that concern diet, or ſenſual pleaſures, it becomes Abſtinence; if upon objects of terrour, it becomes Fortitude, or Magnanimity: Juſt ſo is it with Charity. For,</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Charity is a vertue which never goes alone, and is buſied in ſolitary places, being reſerved, and excluded, from the ſociety and communion of other Graces; But it is that which ſeaſons, gives life and efficacy to all the reſt; without which, if it were poſſible for me to enjoy all the Graces that the bountiful hand of God ever ſhowred upon reaſonable Creature; yet, if St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak truth, I ſhould be nothing worth: It is that which fulfils all the Commandements: This is evident to all that ſhall but ſleightly and in haſte read over 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. beginning with verſ. 4. and ſo onwards:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.4, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> where we may behold almoſt all the vertues that can be named, enwrapped in one vertue of Charity; and Love, according to the ſeveral Acts thereof, chang'd and transform'd into ſo many ſeveral Graces. <hi>It ſuffereth long,</hi> and ſo 'tis Longanimity; <hi>It is kind,</hi> and ſo 'tis Courteſie; <hi>It vaunteth not it ſelf,</hi> and ſo 'tis Modeſty; <hi>It is not puffed up,</hi> and ſo 'tis Humility; <hi>It is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily provok'd,</hi> and ſo 'tis Lenity; <hi>It thinketh no evil,</hi> and ſo 'tis Simplicity; <hi>It rejoyceth in the Truth,</hi> and ſo 'tis Verity; <hi>It beareth all things,</hi> and ſo 'tis Fortitude; <hi>It believeth all things,</hi> and ſo 'tis Faith; <hi>It hopeth all things,</hi> and ſo 'tis Confidence: <hi>It endureth all things,</hi> and ſo 'tis Patience; <hi>It never faileth,</hi> and ſo 'tis Perſeverance.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. You ſee two glorious and divine Vertues, namely, Faith and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, though not naturally expreſs'd, yet pretty well counterfeited by the Moraliſt. And to make up the Analogy compleat, we have the third Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al vertue, which is Hope, reaſonably well ſhadow'd out in that which they call <hi>Inten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>io Finis:</hi> which is nothing elſe but a fore-taſting of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which they propoſe to themſelves as a ſufficient reward for all their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and melancholick endeavours.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. What ſhall we ſay, (my beloved Friends), Shall the Heatheniſh Moraliſt, meerly out of the ſtrength of natural Reaſon, conclude, that the knowledg of what is good and fit to be done, without a practiſe of it upon our affections, and outward actions, to be nothing worth, nay, ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and contemptible? And ſhall we, who have the Oracles of God; nay, the whole perfect will of God fully ſet down in the holy Scriptures, in every page almoſt whereof, we find this urg'd and preſs'd upon us, That to know our Maſters will, without performing, it, is fruitleſs unto us; nay, will intend the heat, and add vertue and power to the lake of fire and brimſtone; reſerved for ſuch empty unfruitful Chriſtians: and ſhall we, I ſay, content our ſelves any longer with bare hearing and knowing of the Word, and no more? God forbid, Rather let us utterly avoid this holy
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64345:223"/>Temple of God: Let us rather caſt his Word behind our backs, and be as ignorant of his holy Will as ever our fore-fathers were: Let us contrive any courſe to cut off all commerce and entercourſe, all communion and acquaintance with our God, rather then when we profeſs to know him, and willingly to allow him all thoſe glorious Titles and Attributes by which he hath made himſelf known unto us in his Word, in our hearts to deny him, in our lives and practiſes to diſhonour him and uſe him deſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. It were no hard matter, I think, to perſwade any, but reſolved hardned minds, that Fruit is neceſſary before any admiſſion into heaven, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by propoſing to your conſiderations the form and proceſs of that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to which you every man in his own perſon, muſt ſubmit. The Authors word may be taken for the truth of what I ſhall tell you: for the ſtory we receive from his mouth that ſhall be Judg of all, and therefore is likely to know what courſe and order himſelf will obſerve.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. In the General Reſurrection, when ſentence of abſolution, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, ſhall be paſs'd upon every one according to his deſerts, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is on no ſide mentioned: but one, becauſe he hath cloathed the naked, and fed the hungry, and done ſuch like works of Charity, he is taken; and the reſt, that have not done ſo much, are refuſed: Will it avail any one then to ſay, Lord, we confeſs, we have not done theſe works, but we have ſpent many an hour in hearing and talking of thy Word; nay, we have maintain'd to the utmoſt of our power, and to our own great prejudice, many Opinions and Tenents: Alas! we little thought, that any ſpotted imperfect work of ours was requiſite, we were reſolved that for working thou hadſt done enough for us to get us to heaven: Will any ſuch excuſes as theſe ſerve the turn? Far be it from us to think ſo.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. If you will turn to <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. you ſhall find ſtronger and better excuſes then theſe to no purpoſe:<note place="margin">Mat. 7.22.</note> 
                     <hi>Many ſhall ſay unto me,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt), <hi>Lord, have not we propheſied in thy Name?</hi> Theſe were ſomething more then hearers, they had ſpent their time in preaching and converting ſouls unto Chriſt, (which is a work, if directed to a right end, of the moſt precious and admirable value, that it is poſſible for a creature to perform): And yet whiles they did not practiſe themſelves what they taught others, they became Caſt-aways. Others there were, <hi>that had caſt out Devils, and done many miracles;</hi> And yet ſo lov'd the unclean ſpirits, that themſelves were poſſeſs'd withal, that they could not endure to part company then, and now were never likely.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. But have not I all this while miſtaken my Auditory? Were not theſe Inſtructions fitter for the Univerſities? Had it not been more fit and ſeaſonable for me to have inſtructed and catechis'd mine hearers, rather than to give them cautions and warnings, leſt they ſhould abuſe their knowledg? No ſurely! Inſtructions to make uſe of knowledg in our practiſe and converſation, and not to content our ſelves with meer know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hearing, and talking of the myſteries of our Salvation, cannot in the moſt ignorant Congregation be unſeaſonable. Even the Heathen which were utter ſtrangers from the knowledge of Gods wayes, did not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding render themſelves inexcuſable, for deteining ſome part of the Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it were, naturally ingrafted in them, in unrighteouſneſs. So, that there is no man in the world, but knows much more then he practiſes,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64345:223"/>every man hides ſome part, at leaſt, of his Talent in a Napkin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let every man, even the moſt ignorant that hears me this day, ſearch the moſt inward ſecret corners of his heart for this treaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and let him take it forth, and put it into the Uſurers hands, and trade thriftily with it, that he may return his Lord his own with encreaſe, <hi>Bleſſed is that ſervant whom his Lord when he cometh ſhall find ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Verily I ſay unto you, he ſhall make him Ruler over all his Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="42">42. And thus I have gone through one member of my Firſt General, namely, the conſideration, wherein the Imprudence of the Fool in my Text doth conſiſt. In the proſecution whereof, I have diſcovered unto you, how ſeverally Satan plants his Engins for the ſubverſion of the Church; In the Primitive times, when Religion was more ſtirring and active, and Charity in Faſhion, He aſſay'd to corrupt mens underſtandings with Hereſies; and there, by the way, was obſerv'd his order and method, how diſtinctly beginning in thoſe firſt times with the firſt Article he hath orderly ſucceeded to corrupt the next following, and now in theſe laſt dayes, hee's got to even the laſt end of the Creed. But ſince, by the mercy and goodneſs of God, we are delivered, and ſtand <hi>firm in the Faith once delivered to the Saints;</hi> he hath raiſed another Engine againſt us that ſtand, and that is To work, that our Orthodox Opinions do us no good; which he performs by ſnatching the Word out of our Hearts, and making it unfruitful in our Lives: Now thoſe that are thus enveagl'd and wrought upon, are meerly befool'd by the Devil, or rather by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for ſo I told you, that Saint <hi>James</hi> ſays: And for an example, I propos'd the learned Phariſees, who for all their learning and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in the Scripture, yet our Saviour denounceth eight ſeveral Woes againſt them for being Fools and blind Guides. So that the Fool in hand was not oppos'd to a Learned man, but to a Prudent man: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a worthy Doctor of our Church did well define Faith to be <hi>A ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Prudence,</hi> that is, a knowledg ſought out only for practiſe. And there I compared Faith with moral Prudence, and the fruit thereof Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity with the vertue of Univerſal Juſtice. Therefore leſt the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then ſhould riſe up in judgment againſt us for not doing ſo much with the help and advantage of Gods Word as they could without it; I did, and do, beſeech you not to content your ſelves with meer knowing and hearing, with only a conceit of Faith without Works, for that was an ancient Hereſie in the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> (whom God, by name, profeſſeth an Hatred to, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells us.) And for an effectual motive, I told you, how at the laſt great Tryal, you ſhall not be catechis'd, How well you can ſay your Creed, or how many Catechiſms without Book, but, How fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in works of Charity your Faith hath been. And ſo I come to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond member of the Firſt General, namely, the conſideration how danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and grievous a burden Knowledg will be, where it is fruitleſs and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual: of which, briefly.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. I will once again repeat that divine ſentence of the Pſalmiſt in Pſal. 111.10. <hi>The fear of God is the beginning of wiſdom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 111.10.</note> 
                     <hi>and a good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding have all they that do thereafter.</hi> i.e. Till a man put his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in practiſe he is ſo farr from being a good man, that he is ſcarſe a man, hath not the underſtanding of a man till he do, till he fall a work; he was
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64345:224"/>wiſer a great deal before he gained his knowledg: Knowledg alone is a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purchaſe in the mean time. It is ſo worthy a purchaſe, that, as it ſhould ſeem by our Saviours account, till a man have obtained ſome competency in knowledg, he hath gotten no right to the Kingdom of Darkneſs and Hell.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. For certainly, no man can juſtly challenge damnation, but he that is burdened with Sin: Now he that hath no knowledg, but is utterly blind in his underſtanding, hath no ſin, that is, in compariſon; the words are (<hi>Joh.</hi> 9.39, &amp;c.) <hi>And Jeſus ſaid, for judgment I am come into this world,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 9.39, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>that they which ſee not might ſee, and that they which ſee might be made blind;</hi> Not as if Chriſt did imprint, or inflict, blindneſs upon any man, but only occaſionally, that is, thoſe which walk in darkneſs, and love it: when the light comes upon them, and diſcovers their wandring, they hate it, and turn their eyes from it, and become more perverſly and obſtinately blind. In the ſame ſenſe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 7.) <hi>Sin taking occaſion by the Law becomes more ſinful;</hi> whil'ſt ſin is not oppos'd, it goes on in its courſe quietly; but when the Commandement comes and diſcovers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes it, it becomes furious and abominable, and much more raging and violent.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. There follows,<note place="margin">Verſ. 40.</note> 
                     <hi>And ſome of the Phariſees which were with him, heard theſe words, and ſaid unto him, Are we blind alſo?</hi> There is nothing in the world, that a Phariſee can with leſs patience endure than to hear any intimation given, that he may be ſuſpected of folly: And therefore they were not ſo ſenſible, or conceited of ſome wrong received, when our Saviour call'd them <hi>Generation of Vipers,</hi> as they are when their wiſdom and diſcretion are call'd in queſtion. Witneſs this anſwer; when no man ſpake to them, they ſuſpiciouſly demand, whether Chriſt in his laſt words meant them or no. But what anſwers our Saviour?</p>
                  <p n="46">46. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto them:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſ. 41.</note> 
                     <hi>If ye were blind, ye ſhould have no ſin; but now ye ſay, We ſee, therefore your ſin remaineth.</hi> As if he had ſaid, So little ſhall this ſuppoſed knowledg and wiſdom, that ye have, profit you, that you ſhall curſe the time that ever you ſaw the holy Word of God, and wiſh that all the Sermons that ever you heard, all the gracious Invitations and ſweet Promiſes which God by the miniſtery of his Servants the Prophets, hath ſent unto you, had been ſentences of ſome horrible death and torments, from the mouth of a ſevere Judg. For, your ſins, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had not been ſo inſupportable, now by your abuſing the knowledg which God hath given you, by your wilful contempt of thoſe many invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which have continually ſounded in your ears, are become as a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain upon you to cruſh you into powder: You have hang'd a Milſtone about your own necks, which ſhall irrecoverably ſink you into the bottomleſs comfortleſs pit, whereas otherwiſe there might have been ſome hope of eſcape.</p>
                  <p n="47">47. And yet for all this, let not any one favour and cheriſh himſelf in this conceipt, That, he thanks God, he is ignorant enough, that a very little practiſe will ſerve his turn, his knowledg is not ſo much that it ſhould put him to too great a labour in expreſſing it in the courſe of his life: For whoſoever he be that dares entertain, or give way to ſuch a thought as this is, Let him be ſure that if he do not know ſo much as God requires at his hands, (eſpecially now that God hath ſealed up the Scripture-Canon, now that the whole Will of God is revealed) this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64345:224"/>very ignorance alone will be a thouſand weights, to faſten him on the earth, to make him ſure for ever aſcending to God, in whom there is no darkneſs at all.</p>
                  <p n="48">48. For it is not ſo with an ignorant man, as it is with one that is blind, who, if he will be ſure not to tempt God by venturing and ruſhing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in paths unknown unto him, may live as long and as ſafe as he that is moſt quick-ſighted: No, Ignorance alone, though it be not active and fruitful in works of darkneſs, is crime enough. For with what colour of reaſon will ſuch a one expect the reward of the Juſt? Such a one will not doubt, but that the Gates of Heaven are barr'd againſt the ſottiſh blind ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Heathen, to whom God never revealed any part of his Will; yet himſelf may fare well enough. Is not this a degree beyond madneſs it ſelf? What? does ſuch a one think, that becauſe he lives among religious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſuch as are well acquainted with the way to Heaven, that himſelf ſhall be ſure to go for company? Does he make no doubt of his part in the Reſurrection of the Juſt, becauſe he was born in <hi>England,</hi> or in ſuch a year of our Lord when the Goſpel flouriſhed? Nay, ſhall it not be much more tolerable for the worſt of the Heathen than for a ſuch a man?</p>
                  <p n="49">49. For if the Heathen were left without excuſe, becauſe they knew not God, or, if they knew him, they did not honour him as God, whereas they were only inſtructed by the Book of Nature: The very main Principle of all Religion, namely, That there is a God, was a buſineſs of great labour, and required a good underſtanding to find out, being a Concluſion to be collected and deduced from many experiments of his power, providence, and the like. Shall thoſe hope to eſcape, that pretend ignorance, after they may, if they refuſe it not, have uſe of all that ever Reaſon found out; nay, have before their eyes the ſum and effect of all the Sermons and Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that ever any Prophet or Apoſtle made ſince the world began: If after all this, there be any ſafety to be hop'd for from Ignorance, then have the Apoſtles travell'd, Chriſt preach'd, nay dy'd, in vain.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. But to return to our buſineſs in hand. Knowledg, at leaſt, in ſome meaſure there muſt neceſſarily be, elſe no hope of Salvation: And with Knowledge, there muſt of neceſſity be joyn'd ſome proportionable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Practiſe, elſe a greater and more inſupportable burden of woe and deſtruction. And the reaſon is evident out of thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>To whom much is given of him ſhall much be required.</hi> We muſt know, that there is not any good thing in the world wherein we have any propriety; We are only Stewards, and have ſuch things committed to our truſt, and one day there will certainly be exacted a ſtrict account. As of our riches, health, education, but much more our knowledg, and eſpecially that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, which is perfected only in practiſe, ſuch is the wiſdom of a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. What reaſon can be imagined why God ſhould take ſuch pains, give ſuch royal and precious graces to his Servants the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to enable them to make known his good will and pleaſure, and what he commands us, and expects at our hands, Was all this perform'd, think we, to afford us only matter of Table-talk? Does he exhort and perſwade us to hear and diſcourſe? No ſurely, He gave it us to profit withal, both our ſelves and others. And therefore where there is a more aboundant plenty of knowledg lent us, the Bill of Account muſt ariſe proportionably, or for what is wanting in the ſum, we remain debtors; and when <hi>once the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64345:225"/>Creditor catches us by the throat and caſts us into Priſon, there is no coming out, till all, even the uttermoſt Farthing, be diſcharg'd:</hi> he might as well have ſaid Never, for it comes all to one end.</p>
                  <p n="52">52. It will be worth our conſideration, and very material, to preſs this ſo neceſſary a point, to take notice of the nature and faſhion of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſhall befal the Fool in my Text, and ſuch companions of his, as are content to enjoy a fruitleſs in-effectual knowledg, how fit and ſuitable it is to their offence. You ſhall find it expreſſed in <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.25, &amp;c. in theſe terms.<note place="margin">Luk. 13.25.</note> 
                     <hi>Many in that day ſhall begin to ſay, We have eaten and drunk in thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets:</hi> This is ſomething more then hearing Sermons, or learning Catechiſms by heart. Theſe had heard him preach, nay, were familiarly acquainted with him, and yet in that day will get but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs anſwer from him in the following verſe,<note place="margin">Verſ. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>But he ſhall ſay, I tell you, I know not whence you are; Depart from me ye workers of Iniquity.</hi> St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> hath it more ſharply, <hi>I never knew you.</hi> They might elſe have impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his not knowing them to the weakneſs of his memory: But he ſtops that conceit, and profeſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He never knew them: <hi>i.e.</hi> He denies not, but he had often ſeen them at Sermon when he preach'd, and, it may be, he had eaten and drunk with them, yet for all this, He never knew them; they were ſtrangers to him, he never acknowledged them to be his flock, and therefore was not bound to take notice of them: But there is one will own them, even Satan, whom before they acknowledged for their Lord; and to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom they may, nay they muſt, go.</p>
                  <p n="53">53. Are not theſe men right ſerv'd? are not they juſtly and righteouſly dealt withal? They had eaten and drunk in his preſence, it is true; Nay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, they had eaten him and drunk him in his Sacrament: They had oft heard him preach in their ſtreets, and could for a need repeat a good deal of the ſubſtance of his Sermons: But, in very deed, they never knew him, nor one word that ever he ſpoke: that is, they took no eſpecial notice of him, they did not acknowledg him for their Lord, neither cared they to perform any thing that he commanded. And now he is quit with them, He remembers well enough what kind of people they were, even his very Enemies and Deriders; and as he never did acknowledg them for his ſheep, ſo neither now will he admit them into his ſold. A moſt righteous, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, a moſt heavy doom.</p>
                  <p n="54">54. And here I will briefly end my other member of the Firſt General, namely, how dangerous and heavy a burden Knowledg will be, where it is fruitleſs and ineffectual. Where you have heard how poor and worthleſs a purchaſe Knowledg alone is; nay, how without it, a man has ſcarſe any ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle at all unto Hell, there is no guilt without it; Alone it is a good qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, a fair towardly diſpoſition towards our ruin. Our Saviour profeſſes that the Phariſees themſelves, (A Nation, the very proverb of perverſneſs and infidelity) if they had been blind, <hi>i.e.</hi> without knowledg, they had had no ſin. Yet for all this, though Knowledg be ſo dangerous a ware (it is ſomething like Gunpowder; a man when he has it muſt take heed how he uſes it): yet this is by no means a ſufficient excuſe for any one utterly to neglect the purchaſe of it, at leaſt, in ſome meaſure: For it is true, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg not uſed, or ill uſed, will aggravate our torment, and adds even fire unto Hell: Yet withal, it is true, that an utter neglect of all Knowledg, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in theſe times of light, when it is to be had at ſo cheap a rate, will make
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64345:225"/>damnation as ſure to a man as the former. Now the reaſon, why Knowledg, where it is fruitleſs in practiſe, will be abundantly fruitful in torment, is taken from that maxim of our Saviour, <hi>To whom much is given, of him ſhall much be required. i. e.</hi> We being only Stewards of Gods bleſſings, no proprietaries in them, muſt expect one day to give account of them all, but eſpecially Knowledg, which is a Ware of the chiefeſt Trade. Now where there are great receipts, and no disburſements, the debt muſt needs be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great; and when once the Sergeant hath arreſted us for it, The Lord knows when we ſhall pay it. The laſt thing that I propos'd to your thoughts, was the ſuitableneſs of the puniſhment that will attend ſuch an offence: For the Fool, in my Text, when he would give himſelf leave to think, knew well enough that there was a God, and that all his love and ſervice was due to him: But theſe were melancholick thoughts, and ſuch as would hinder him in the proſecution of his deſign'd projects, and therefore he put them farr from him: So that, in effect, and in Gods account, he was utterly ignorant of him, did not, at all know him. Juſt ſo ſhall they be ſerved: Chriſt knows all the world better then any man knows his own heart: Yet in that great day he ſhall prove to be a very ſtranger, utterly ignorant of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the world, though many of them had been his acquaintance here; nay, though through faith, in his power, they had unawares by wonders and miracles, brought many to Heaven, and had been good helpers to deſtroy the Infernal Kingdom, whereof before they were in Affection, and now for ever muſt, indeed, be Inhabitants.</p>
                  <p n="55">55. There remains the other main General, which is, indeed, the ſubſtance of the whole Text, namely, the fruit of this folly, and that is, Atheiſm, not in opinion, but practiſe: In the proſecution whereof, I ſhall mainly inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, to demonſtrate, by infallible deductions out of Gods Word, that men who profeſs Religion, and a perfect Knowledg of God, yet whiles they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him only the Brain, and not (what he only deſires) the Heart and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, may prove, in Gods account, very Atheiſts. Or, to bring it neerer home, I will ſhew how that many, the ordinary courſes, and the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controuled practiſes, of men of this age do utterly contradict, and formally deſtroy the very Foundations and Principles of the glorious Religion which they profeſs. But this will require a much longer time then your patience can allow me: Therefore I will only add ſome few words of Application, of what hath been ſpoken, and ſo conclude.</p>
                  <p n="56">56. That Jewel which our Saviour ſo magnifies, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 13.) and ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the wiſdom of the Merchant for ſelling all, even utterly undoing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to purchaſe it, is the Goſpel of the Kingdom of Heaven. Which though it be of moſt precious and ineſtimable value, worthy the ſelling of the whole world to buy it, yet is every mans money, every man has riches enough to adventure upon it, ſo he will but ſell all that he has, ſo he will be content to turn bankrupt for it, and upon no other terms can he have it.</p>
                  <p n="57">57. That advice which Chriſt gave the rich young man, that had a good mind to follow him, <hi>viz.</hi> that he ſhould ſell all that he had, and take up his Croſs, was not any extraordinary unuſual tryal, but we have all accepted the ſame offer upon the very ſame conditions: We muſt of neceſſity ſell all, deny and renounce the keeping and poſſeſſing of any thing beſides this Pearl; We muſt even ſell our ſelves, deny and renounce our own ſouls, they are both become Gods own, and we are but borrowers of them: Now if we be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64345:226"/>not Maſters of our goods, nor of our ſelves, neither then may we do our own actions, we muſt not think our own thoughts. They were ſuch Fools as this great notorious one in my Text, who in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. ſay, <hi>Our tongues are our own, we may ſay what we liſt.</hi> We are all bought with a price; yea all that we have, is bought.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. Yet though we muſt ſell all, and deny our own ſelves, yet we need not part with our goods, or riches, we need not make away our ſelves. For example: when our Saviour ſays, <hi>He that hateth not Father and Mother, and Brethren, and Siſters,</hi> and all the world beſides, <hi>for my Names ſake, and the Goſpels, is not worthy of me:</hi> This ſpeech does not bind me to hate, perſecute, and deſtroy all the kindred I have; no, but rather to love and honor them, to ſpend, and be ſpent for them: Yet if thoſe perſons, or if it be poſſible for ought elſe, to be more dear and precious then they, ſtand in my way to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me from coming to Chriſt; then it is time for me to hate them, then I muſt trample them under my feet. So that a man is no more bound to ſell his Goods, that is, to throw them away, than he is to hate his Parents; Only neither of them may by any means offend us, or annoy us, in our journey to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="59">59. Now to bring this home to our purpoſe. Can any face be ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as to profeſs he hath already ſold all, himſelf to boot, and is ready to part with them when God ſhal call for them, who contents himſelf only with knowing and hearing Stories of him, and reſerves his heart to his own uſe, which is all that God requires? Can he with any reaſon in the world be ſaid to ſell all for the Goſpel of Chriſt, that ſees Chriſt himſelf every day al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt hungry, and does not feed him; naked, and does not clothe him; in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and does not viſit him? For in aſmuch as they do not theſe offices of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to his beloved little ones, they deny them to him. Will he be found to be worthy of Chriſt, that for his ſake will not renounce one delightful ſin, which a Heathen would eaſily have done, only for the empty reward of fame? That for his ſake will not forgive his Brother ſome ſmall injury re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; nay, perhaps ſome great kindneſs offered as a ſeaſonable reproof, or loving diſſwaſion, from ſinning? That for his ſake will not undergo the leaſt trouble in furthering his own Salvation?</p>
                  <p n="60">60. Far from us (beloved Chriſtians) be ſo barren a Profeſſion, a Profeſſion having only the vizzard and <hi>form of Godlineſs, but denying the power thereof.</hi> No let us with thankful hearts, and tongues, recount and conſider, what God hath done for our ſouls, how he hath given us his Word, abundantly ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to inſtruct us. How he hath ſpoke the word, and great is the multitude of Preachers. Yet withal, let us conſider, that it is in our power to turn theſe unvaluable Treaſures of Gods favors into horrible curſes. Let us conſider how God hath ſent out his Word, &amp; it will not return unto him empty, it wil be effectual one way or other, it will perform ſome great work in us. God doth but expect what entertainment it finds upon earth, and will proportion a reward accordingly on them which detain the truth; in unrighteouſneſs he will rain ſnares, fire, and brimſtone: But to ſuch as with meek hearts, &amp; due reverence <hi>receive it into good ground,</hi> and expreſs the power thereof in their lives, there remaineth an exceeding eternal weight of Joy and Glory. <hi>Let us therefore walk as children of the light;</hi> and not content our ſelves with a bare empty Profeſſion of Religion: <hi>Let him that</hi> but <hi>nameth the Name of the Lord, depart from Iniquity.</hi> Brethren, conſider what I ſay, and the Lord give you underſtanding in all things. <hi>To God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Firſt therefore, I conceived (by attending to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> courſe and ſeries of the Pſalm, and by comparing this place with many others in Holy Scripture in different language, expreſſing the ſame ſenſe) That this Fool, in my Text, was not a man utterly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and devoid of the knowledg of God, and his Word; For he is ſuppos'd by the Pſalmiſt, to be a man living within the pale of the Church, and outwardly profeſſing the true Religion and Worſhip of God: And thereupon, Secondly, That his Atheiſm was no He atheniſh, Philoſop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ical Atheiſm, no problematical maintaining an opinion, That <hi>there is no God,</hi> For even among the very Heathens, we read not of above three or four, of any account, which have proceeded to this excelling degree and height of Impiety.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But this Perſon (whether <hi>Doeg</hi> the <hi>Edomite,</hi> or whoſoever he were), is ſuch a one, as though, in his Profeſſion, and even ſerious thoughts,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he do not queſtion a Deity, but would be a mortal Enemy to any one, who ſhould dare to deprive and rob Almighty God of any of his Glorious Attributes: Notwithſtanding in his Heart, (that is, in the phraſe of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) in the propenſion and inclination of his Affections, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, in the courſe and practiſe of his life, he denies and renounces God: He accounts the ſpending a little time in thinking and meditating on the Providence, or Mercy, or Severity of God, to be an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment very ungainful and diſadvantageous to him, a buſineſs likely to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſpoil many of his ungodly projects, and to hinder him in his fortunes: And for this reaſon, he will put God farr away from him; He will not ſuffer him to be (as the Pſalmiſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 10.4.</note> Pſal. 10.4.) <hi>in all his crafty purpoſes.</hi>

4. I yet willingly confeſs, that this, <hi>Saying in the Heart, There is no God,</hi> may reaſonably be interpreted to be a ſecret whiſpering-ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, an inward perſwaſion, by fits, which a wretched worldling may have, that, ſince he has thrived ſo well by his careleſneſs in obſerving Gods Word, and obſtinate oppoſing himſelf to his will, it may be poſſible there is indeed no God at all; or, if there be, that he will not vouchſafe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend ſo low, as to take notice what is done here on earth, or to obſerve how each particular perſon, behaves himſelf in this life. Now, becauſe I will not ſet up one of theſe Expoſitions againſt the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I will hereafter, as occaſion ſhall offer it ſelf, make uſe of them both.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Having therefore conceived the ſenſe of the Text to be ſuch as I have now told you; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> In the words I obſerved two General Parts. Firſt, the cauſe of Atheiſm, and, by conſequence, all the abominations following through the whole Pſalm, intimated in the perſon <hi>Nabal,</hi> i. e. <hi>The Fool,</hi> which is, Folly; <hi>i. e.</hi> Ignorance, or rather, Incogitancy, Inconſideration. Secondly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The effect of this Folly, which, is Atheiſm, and that ſeated not in the Brain, but in the Heart or Affections. I have already gone through the former part, namely, the cauſe of Atheiſm, which is Folly: in the proſecution whereof, I endeavoured to diſcover, wherein this Folly doth conſiſt. And that is not ſo much in an utter ignorance of God, and his. Holy Word, as a not making a good uſe of it, when it is known, a ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to ly dead, to ſwim unprofitably in the Brain, without any fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the reformation of a mans life and converſation. And there I ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, firſt,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> what extream folly it was for a man to ſeek to encreaſe the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of his Maſters will, without a reſolution to encreaſe proportionably in a ſerious active performance thereof. And ſecondly, the extream una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable danger and encreaſe of guilt, which knowledg, without practiſe, brings with it. To both which Conſiderations, I ſeverally annexed Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to the Conſciences of them that heard me, and ſhould have proceeded to—</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Second General Part: which is the effect and fruit of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or inconſideration of <hi>Nabal, (the Fool)</hi> in my Text, which is Atheiſm practical, not of the Underſtanding, but the Will and Affections. But, the time being ſpent in the proſecution of the former General Part, I was forced to reſerve this Second General, to be the employment of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hour.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Only thus much, I then made promiſe of; (which debt I purpoſe now to diſcharge to you) namely, To demonſtrate by infallible deductions out of Gods Word, that many, who profeſs Religion, and a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Gods Word, yet whiles they allow him only the Brain, and not (what he almoſt only requires) the Heart, and Affections, may prove in Gods account very Atheiſts. Or to bring it nearer home, I promiſed to ſhew, how that many the ordinary courſes, and moſt incontrouled practiſes of men of this age, do utterly contradict, and formally deſtroy the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and Principles of that glorious Religion which they profeſs. Of theſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. At the firſt ſight, indeed, a man would think, that of all the places in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, and of all the ages which have been ſince the world began, That this Text, and theſe times, ſhould ſuit worſt together: For firſt, if a man would ſtrive with all the carneſtneſs, and even ſpite, he could, in all the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64345:227"/>odious colours to deſcribe the worſt of all humane creatures, even the Idolatrous, ſelf-devouring <hi>Indians,</hi> What more horrible expreſſion could he imagin to himſelf, then to call them Fools, and ſuch <hi>Fools, who ſay in their Heart, There is no God.</hi> Again, if we ſhall enquire and ask the former Ages, if ever the world was ſo ſtored, and even oppreſſed with knowledg: They will tell us, That the Light was never a burden, nor Knowledg a vice before now: Never till now did all ſorts and conditions of men pretend to be able to ſtate the moſt intricate profound queſtions of our Religion. Never till now was <hi>Moſes</hi> his wiſh fulfilled, <hi>I would to God, that all the people of the Lord were Prophets:</hi> though in a ſenſe which would ſcarce have pleaſed him.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Theſe things conſidered, were it not fit (think you), that I ſhould renounce my Text, or travel to find out a Nation whom it may concern, and who have need to hear Atheiſts condemned? I would to God, (my Beloved Brethren), that whatſoever I ſhall ſpeak againſt that fearful ſin of Atheiſm, may prove vain unprofitable words, words which may return empty, having found none to faſten upon: I would to God, that I might ſtrive now, as one that beateth the air, ſo that you, (even you, who know ſo much) were innocent. But <hi>David</hi> found this a Doctrin fit to be preſſed in his days, which were none of the worſt neither: Yea, he hath a ſecond time, (in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.) almoſt <hi>in terminis terminantibus,</hi> repeated whatſoever he here ſpeaks of the Atheiſt: We find not ſuch an example through the whole Scripture, (except it be in a Hiſtory, or where the quotation is mentioned.) Therefore ſurely it may be pertinent, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſeful even in the Church to have Atheiſm diſcovered, to have this Doctrin preach'd and re-preach'd: it was ſo in <hi>David</hi>'s times: and it ſhall go hard, but we ſhall ſhew, that we our ſelves, (though never ſo wiſe and learn'd and knowing in our own opinion): yet that we alſo ought not to take it to heart, if ſometimes we be ſuſpected and challenged of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm:</p>
                  <p n="10">10. That Temptation which the Devil found hard enough for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, even when he was an Angel of Light, namely, <hi>Ero ſimilis Altiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo; I ſhall be like the moſt Higheſt:</hi> Now that it is his Office, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, to become a Tempter, He has ſince ſcarce ever varied: At the firſt exerciſe of his Trade, with his firſt cuſtomers, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> he begun with it, <hi>Ye ſhall be as Gods, knowing Good and Evil.</hi> And if we ſhall unpartially examin our own thoughts, we ſhall find almoſt in every ſuggeſtion, at leaſt, ſome degree and tincture of Atheiſm: either we do exalt and Deifie our own ſelves, or elſe we do diſhonour, and, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, degrade Almighty God, depoſing him from that ſoveraignty and ſway which he ought to exerciſe in our Hearts and Conſciences.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. This, I ſay, is true in ſome meaſure, in all temptations, in all ſins whatſoever, there is ſome quantity of Atheiſm, though the ſins be but of an ordinary ſize and rank: But this is not that which I would now ſtand upon: It concerns me, to ſhow, that though men be never ſo Orthodox in their Opinions, though they pretend to never ſo much zeal of the Truth, which they profeſs, yet unleſs that Divine Truth be powerful and perſwaſive enough to the performance and practiſe of ſuch Duties, as bear a natural reſemblance and proportion unto it: They that make ſuch a Profeſſion of Gods Truth, do but flatter themſelves, they only think they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64345:228"/>believe, but indeed, and in truth, there is no ſuch thing as Faith in them. For, we muſt know, that there is no Divine Truth ſo utterly ſpeculative, but that there naturally and infallibly flows and reſults from it (as neceſſarily as warmth from light) a Duty to be practis'd and put in execution: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that it is impoſſible for a man to be truly perſwaded of the one, but he ſhall infallibly be perſwaded to the other:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Joh</hi> 2 4.</note> So that <hi>he which ſaith, He knoweth God, and keepeth not his Commandements, is a Lyar, and the Truth is not in him.</hi> And this I ſhall endeavour to confirm by Induction, examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth and reality of our aſſent to the chief Fundamental. Points of our Religion, by our practiſes anſwerable thereto, and concluding, that where the latter is not to be found, it is but a vain perſwaſion and phantaſtical illuſion for a man to think he hath the former.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. But in the firſt place, that we may be the better able, and without interruption proceed in this deſign'd courſe, I will firſt remove an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which may ſeem to prevail againſt that which hath been ſpoken: to this effect:<label type="milestone">

                     <hi>The Devils</hi> (as Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith), <hi>believe and tremble:</hi> They do indeed aſſent unto the Truth of all the myſteries of our Salvation: In the place of St. <hi>James,</hi> they acknowledg One God: In <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.28. they acknowledg the ſecond Article of our Faith, allowing Chriſt to be Son of God. And the like may be ſaid of the others following; And yet if we examin their practiſe: How abſolutely contradicting and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring is it with their profeſſion? Therefore, it may ſeem, that where there is a firm aſſent to Divine Truths, there may conſiſt with it a contrary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant practiſe.</p>

                     </label> that the Aſſent which the Devil gives to the Revelations of God, is extreamly different from that belief which is exacted of us Chriſtians, and which every one of us, (though never ſo vitious and irreligious) would gladly perſwade our ſelves that we allow unto Gods Word: For though, for example, the Devils acknowledge the Precepts and Commandements of God to be Holy, and Juſt, and Good, and moſt fit to be obſerved; As likewiſe that to thoſe who ſincerely, and without Hypocriſie, ſhall perform theſe Commandements of God,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1.</note> the promiſes of God ſhall be <hi>Yea and Amen,</hi> they ſhall infallibly attain thoſe joys which exceed mans underſtanding to comprehend: Yet, theſe things to them are only as a Tale which is told; or rather they are to them occaſion of horrour and gnaſhing of Teeth, that there ſhould be ſuch glorious comfortable things, which do nothing concern them, and of malice and hatred to thoſe who have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in them, and are in a fair poſſibility of attaining unto them: And therefore no marvail if ſuch a Faith as this be barren and unfruitful of Good Works. Whereas <hi>our Faith</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>is the ſubſtance of things hoped for,</hi> of things which concern us, we do not only acknowledg, that the Precepts of God are good, but alſo neceſſarily to be performed by us: and that the promiſes of God are not only deſireable in themſelves, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that being ſuch, they were revealed for our ſakes, and are infallibly deſtin'd unto us, when we ſhall have performed ſuch conditions as may by the aſſiſtance of God be executed by us, even with eaſe and pleaſure: Now whereſoever ſuch perſwaſions as theſe are, it is impoſſible (even if the Devils themſelves could be ſuppoſed capable of them) but that there ſhould accompany them earneſt and ſerious endeavours not to come
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64345:228"/>ſhort of the Glory of God. This difficulty therefore being diſſolved, I ſhall perſue the examination of our belief of the Foundations of our Religion, by the fruits and iſſues of it in the practiſes of our lives.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. We will begin with ſome of Gods Attributes: Whoſoever thou art, that profeſſeſt thy ſelf a Chriſtian, thou believeſt, that God whom thou ſerveſt is preſent every where, both in Heaven and Earth, inſomuch, that it is altogether impoſſible for thee to exclude him from thy company; whereſoever thou goeſt, he will purſue thee: Though thou ſhouldſt cloath thy ſelf with darkneſs, as it were with a garment, the darkneſs would be to Him as the Noon-day: And though it were poſſible for thee to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the eyes and obſervation of Men and Angels, yea, even of thine own Conſcience, yet to him thou wouldſt be open and tranſparent; <gap reason="foreign">

Out of thy own mouth ſhalt thou be condemned, thou wicked Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: Dareſt thou then make thy Maſter a witneſs of thy Rebellion and Diſobedience? When thou art about the fulfilling of any of thine ungodly luſts, thou retireſt thy ſelf from company, and art afraid of the faces of men; thou abhorreſt the light: And yet dareſt out-face him whoſe Eyes are ten thouſand times brighter then the Sun. Thou wouldeſt not have the confidence to commit filthineſs, if thy friend were in company: And yet, what injury is done to him by it? what Commandement of his doeſt thou tranſgreſs in it? Or if thou didſt, What power, or authority, has he over thee to puniſh thee? Thou wouldeſt be aſhamed to commit ſuch a ſin, if thy Servant were by, one whom thou art ſo farr from being afraid of, that himſelf, his words, almoſt his very thoughts, are in thy power: Nay, if a child were in company, thou wouldſt not have the face to do it.</p>

Thou canſt not deny, but reſpect to a friend, to a ſervant, even to a child, will with-hold thee from ſuch practiſes, and yet withall confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt, that Almighty God, whom thou profeſſeſt, to ſerve, to fear, and to love, that he all the while looks upon thee, and obſerves thee; his Eyes are never removed from thee, and which is worſe, though thou mayeſt endeavour to forget, and blot, ſuch actions out of thy remembrance, yet it is impoſſible he ſhould ever forget them: He keeps a Regiſter of all thy ſins, which no time ſhall ever be able to deface: And what will it then profit thee to live a cloſe conceal'd ſinner from the world, or to gain amongſt men the reputation of a devout religious Chriſtian, when in the mean time thine own Heart and Conſcience ſhall condemn thee; Nay, when Almighty <hi>God who is greater then thy Heart, and knoweth all things,</hi> when he ſhall be able to object unto thee all thy cloſe ungodly projects, all thy boſome private luſts; yea, when that conceit (wherein thou didſt ſo much pleaſe thy ſelf) of being able to delude and blind the obſervation of the World ſhall nothing avail thee, but whatſoever miſchiefs thou haſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived in thy Cloſet; whatſoever abominations thou haſt practiſed in thy. Bed; all theſe, with each aggravating Circumſtance, ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64345:229"/>in the preſence of all men, and Angels, and Devils: when Satan, whom before thou madeſt an Inſtrument and Bawd unto thy luſts, to whoſe counſels and ſuggeſtions thou before would'ſt only hearken, ſhall be the moſt forward and eager to appeach thee.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. When thou art brought to ſuch an exigent as this (which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a timely unfeigned repentance, as ſure as there is a God in Heaven, thou ſhalt at laſt be brought to) what will then they orthodox opinions do thee good? what will it then profit thee, to ſay, Thou never didſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any impious diſhonourable Tenents concerning God, or any of his glorious Attributes? Yea, how happy hadſt thou been, if worſe than the moſt ignorant heatheniſh Atheiſt, no thought or conſideration of God had entred into thy heart? For this profeſſing thy ſelf a Chriſtian right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed in the knowledge of God, will prove heavier to thee than a thouſand milſtones hanged about thy neck, to ſink thee into the bottome of that comfortleſs Lake of fire and brimſtone? For, for example: What a ſtrange plea would it be, for a Murderer to ſay, I confeſs I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſuch or ſuch a murder; but all the excuſe which I can alledge for my ſelf, is, that I was well ſtudied in the Laws which forbad murder, and I knew that my Judge who tyed me to the obſervance of this Law, upon pain of death, was preſent, and obſerv'd me when I commited the Fact: Surely it would be more tolerable for him to ſay, I never heard of any ſuch Law or Judge; or if I have been told of ſuch things, I gave but little heed to the report, I did not at all believe it. For though this plea will be very inſufficient to acquit the malefactor; yet it will be much more advantageous than the former: for what were that, but to flour the Judge to his face, and to pretend a reſpectful worthy opinion of him, for this end, that his contempt and negligence in performing his Commandements, may be more extream and inexcuſable; and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, without all hope or expectation of pardon. I need make no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the example, the Similitude doth ſufficiently apply it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Therefore it I were to adviſe any man who is reſolved by his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to contradict that opinion which he ſaith he hath of God; or, that is not reſolved to live with that reverence and awfulneſs due to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Almighty God, in whoſe preſence he alwaies is; I would coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel him not to believe himſelf, when he profeſſes the Omnipreſence, or Omniſcience of God: For without all contradiction, though by living in a Nation where every one with whom he converſes, profeſſeth ſo much, he may have learned to ſay, There is a God, and that this God is every where preſent; and takes particular notice of whatſoever is done in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth: yet if this Notion were firmly rooted in his ſoul, as a matter of Religion, as a buſineſs upon which depends the everlaſting wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of his ſoul and body; it is altogether impoſſible for him to continue in an habitual practice of ſuch things as are evidently repugnant and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to ſuch a conceit. For tell me, Would any man in his right ſenſes, when he ſhall ſee another drink down a poyſon which he knows will ſuddenly prove mortal unto him; I ſay, will any man be ſo mad as to believe ſuch a one, though he ſhould, with all the moſt earneſt proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that can be imagined, profeſs that he is not weary of his life, but intends to prolong it as long as God and Nature will give him leave?</p>
                  <p n="19">
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:64345:229"/>
19. The Caſe is altogether in each point and circumſtance the ſame: For he which ſaith, He believeth or aſſenteth to any doctrine, as a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental point of his Religion, intends thus much by it, that he has bound himſelf in certain bonds unto Almighty God (for ſo the very name of Religion doth import) to expect no benefit at all from him, but upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of believing ſuch divine Truths as it ſhall pleaſe him to reveal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, namely, as means and helps of a devout religious life and worſhip of him: For God reveals nothing of himſelf to any man for this end, to ſatisfie his curioſity, or to afford him matter of diſcourſe or news; but to inſtruct him how he may behave himſelf here in this life, that he may attain thoſe promiſes which ſhall be fulfilled to thoſe who ſincerely and devoutly ſerve and obey him.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Therefore he that ſhall ſay, I believe ſuch a Truth revealed by God, and yet lives as if he had never heard of ſuch a thing; yea, as if he had been perſwaded of the contrary; is as much to be believed, as if he ſhould ſay, I will drink a deadly poyſon to quench my thirſt, or will ſtab my ſelf to the heart, for phyſick, to let out ſuperfluous bloud: So that that man who is not reſolved to break off his wicked courſes by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and converſion unto God; that lives as if the Devil only were every where, and he reſolved to pleaſe and delight him with his ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life; let not ſuch a one uſe himſelf to ſay, I believe that God is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies preſent with me, and a ſpectator of my actions; for thereby, he ſhall only add a lye to the reſt of his ſins, and fewel to the lake of fire and brimſtone: He ſhall never perſwade God to believe him, that he was of ſuch an opinion; but that whatſoever his tongue ſaid, and his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy now and then apprehended, yet in his conſcience he was alwaies a conſtant reſolved Atheiſt, and <hi>in his heart he ſaid, There is no God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. In the ſecond place, thou acknowledgeſt, that God whom thou profeſſeſt obedience to, is infinitely Righteous; inſomuch that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that he ſhould not hate and abhorre unrighteouſneſs in whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he finds it: Yea, ſo natural and eſſential is his Juſtice unto him, that he ſhould deny himſelf, if he ſhould accept any mans perſon, if he ſhould not be avenged on ſin, if he ſhould not moſt ſeverely puniſh it. Thou canſt not be ignorant how many vowes and proteſtations he hath made almoſt every where through the Holy Scripture, of his hatred and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt ſin, inſomuch, that heaven and earth may paſs away, but not one jot or tittle of thoſe curſes and plagues ſhall fall to the ground, which he hath denounced againſt impenitent ſinners.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. And ſhall not thy own mouth here once again condemn thee, O thou wicked ſervant? Dareſt thou then every hour wilfully, and even contentedly do ſuch things, as muſt certainly procure his anger and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt thee for ever? Wilt thou, for the ſinful pleaſure of a few minutes, put thy ſelf in ſuch a condition, that God muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be angry with thee; that he muſt ceaſe to be God, unleſs he hate and abhorre thee? Certainly, if thou wouldeſt deſcend into thine own heart, if thou wouldeſt give thy ſelf leave carefully and unpartially to examine thy thoughts, thou wouldeſt find that thy tongue has given thy ſoul the lye, when it hath told thee, that God is immutably Juſt and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and yet for all that, that thou art reſolved to run on in ſuch
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64345:230"/>courſes, as muſt of neceſſity pull down his heavy diſpleaſure againſt thee.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. At leaſt, thou wilt find in thy heart earneſt deſires and wiſhes, that God were not ſo righteous as Preachers tell thee he is! Oh, thinkeſt thou in thy heart, that God were ſuch an unrighteous perſon as I am! Oh, that he could be content to wink at me, when I am about the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of my ungodly deſires! Alas, what harm is it to him, what incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience accrews to him by it, if I enjoy the ſinful pleaſures of this life? Or if he will needs be angry, Oh that it were not in his power to revenge himſelf upon me! Oh that his power were not ſo unlimited as (they ſay) it is!</p>
                  <p n="24">24. I know men will be apt to flatter themſelves, though they be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo vicious, and to think that they are extremely wronged, to have ſuch imputations laid upon them. They will be ready to anſwer me, in the words of <hi>Hazael</hi> to the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> when he told him what horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maſſacres he ſhould commit among the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when he ſhould have the Crown of <hi>Syria</hi> ſet on his head: <hi>What doeſt thou think us dogs, that we ſhould do ſuch things as theſe?</hi> We are ſo far from robbing God of his Juſtice, that we would be mortal enemies to any that dare proceed to that height of impiety: Nay, we would be content to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice our own lives, rather than be brought to deny that, or any other of his glorious Attributes.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Truly, I am ſo charitably minded, as to think that there is none ſo wicked, but would confidently make this defence for himſelf; yea, and believes he is in earneſt when he ſpeaks ſo. But this will not ſerve the turn: For, <hi>God ſeeth not as man ſees,</hi> he judgeth not as man judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but he judgeth righteous judgment. For inſtance, in that great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample which our Saviour gives of the faſhion and courſe of judgment, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which he purpoſes to proceed in the laſt day; He accuſes the wicked, and condemns them for neglect of viſiting, and feeding, and cloathing, Him. The Apology which they make for themſelves, as having never ſeen him in that exigence, would not be taken: For, though I am perſwaded they there ſpake nothing but what they verily thought, namely, that if ever they had ſeen Chriſt himſelf in ſuch want and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, they would not have been ſo hard-hearted to him, as they were to his poor ſervants: yet Chriſt will not allow of that excuſe, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of their uncharitableneſs to afflicted Chriſtians, as directed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. So likewiſe in the Caſe in hand. Though I believe it would be hard to perſwade even the moſt licentious profeſſed ſinner, that he believes not indeed the Juſtice and righteouſneſs of God; yet he ſhall find at laſt, and that miſerably to his coſt, that God who knows his heart much better than himſelf, for all his profeſſions, will yet eſteem him an Atheiſt; and will prove evidently and convincingly unto him, that ſince that knowledge which he pretended to have of Gods Righteouſneſs, had been ſo fruitleſs and ſuperficial, that notwithſtanding ſuch a conceit, he proceeded ſtill on in his ungodly courſes; that therefore he did but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude himſelf all the while with phantaſtical ungrounded illuſions; ſo that whatſoever imagination ſwim in his brain, yet in the language of his heart, that is, in the propenſion and ſway of his affections, he ſaid, <hi>There
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64345:230" rendition="simple:additions"/>is no God</hi>—Now what hath been ſaid of the Omnipreſence, Infinite Knowledge, and Juſtice of God, may by the ſame reaſon and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be ſpoken of the reſt of his glorious Attributes. But the ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time will force me to leave the reſt untouched: I will proceed therefore to make the like collections from one or two Articles more of the Creed.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. Thou believeſt that after this life (which cannot laſt very long, it will, and that ſhortly, have an end) there remain but two waies for all men of what ſtare and condition ſoever that ever were, to be diſpoſed of, either into life and glory everlaſting, or elſe into pains and torments infinite and inſupportable. And by conſequence, that thy ſoul is an immortal ſubſtance, which ſhall for ever continue ſomewhere: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy behaviour here, during that ſhort meaſure of time which thou liveſt upon the earth, it muſt expect a reward proportionable thereto. If thou canſt perſwade thy ſelf to walk worthy of that calling whereunto thou art called in Jeſus Chriſt: If thou wilt not forſwear and renounce that glorious profeſſion which thou madeſt in thy Baptiſm: If thou canſt be content to ſubmit thy ſelf to the eaſie yoke of Chriſt, propoſe to thy ſelf what reward thou canſt imagine, give thy thoughts ſcope and licence to be exceſſive and overflowing in their deſires; if thou art not ſatisfied to the uttermoſt, infinitely above what thou art now able to comprehend, Tell God he is a liar, and has deceived thee. Oh what unſpeakable joyes ſhall hereafter expect thee? Oh with what a burden and weight of glory ſhalt thou even be oppreſſed?</p>
                  <p n="28">28. But on the other ſide; If notwithſtanding ſuch ineſtimable bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings as are now ſet before thine eyes, thou art yet reſolved to content thy ſelf with ſuch vain trifling pleaſures as thou canſt meet with in this life, which yet thou canſt not attain to, but with as much pains, and anxiety, and care; as, if rightly applied, would have been ſufficient to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured heaven for thee! What ſhall I ſay unto thee? only this, <hi>Thou haſt thy reward: Remember that thou haſt already received thy good things.</hi> What a terrible affrighting ſpeech is this? It may be thou haſt fed and glutted thy luſts with ſome pleaſures of this life; it may be thou haſt ſatisfied in ſome ſmall meaſure thy ambition with honour and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and yet it may be, for all thy cares and travels, thou haſt not been able to attain to any of thoſe things as thou didſt deſire; whether thou haſt or haſt not, it is all one, there is little to chuſe, but howſoever, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that thou haſt received thy good things;</hi> Remember, <hi>thou haſt thy reward.</hi> Do not hereafter preſume to offer to pretend to any the leaſt good from God. It may be hereafter thou mayeſt come to ſuch want, as to ſtand in need of a cup of cold water; any, it may be thou wouldeſt think thy ſelf happy, if any body would afford thee but one drop of water to refreſh thy tongue. But in vain: for, <hi>Son, Remember thou haſt already received thy good things.</hi> Thou never ſaweſt beggar ſo ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly wretched and deſtitute, but he might almoſt every where have fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelf with water, and have thanked no body for it: and yet though thou ſhouldeſt even conſume thy ſelf with intreating, and crying for it, yet none ſhall be found to give it thee, even thy liberal good father <hi>Abraham</hi> will deny it to thee.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Surely there cannot be found ſo impudent, ſo unreaſonable a ſinner, as to profeſs he is fully perſwaded of theſe things, and that he hath a deſire, and even ſome hope, that God will be ſo merciful to him, as to perſerve him, that none of thoſe things happen unto him, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to follow the devices of his own heart: To ſay, He acknowledgeth that the joyes which are reſerved for penitent believers, are ſo exceſſively glorious, that the afflictions of this life are not worthy of them, much leſs the vain pleaſures thereof; and yet withal, rather then not enjoy the <hi>pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon,</hi> to make himſelf uncapable of thoſe great bleſſings. Such a generation of men I find in holy Scripture, and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf takes notice of them, who ſay, <hi>We ſhall have peace, though we walk in the imaginations of our heart:</hi> But withal, I can ſcarce meet with God ſo impatient through the whole Bible, as he is with people of ſuch a temper as this, <hi>Surely the Lord will be avenged on ſuch a nation as this, and will make his fierce wrath to ſmoak againſt them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="30">30. Therefore, whomſoever thou art that haſt taken up thy reſolution, to walk in the imagination of thine own heart; at leaſt, take ſo much pity of thy ſelf, do not thou thy ſelf add violence and heart to the wrath of God, which ſhall ſmoak againſt thee, by pretending to a belief of Heaven or Hell, or by ſeeming to profeſs, that all the while that thou art buſie in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of thine ungodly luſts, notwithſtanding that, all that time, this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hath never left thee, <hi>That God will bring thee to Judgment;</hi> That even that every body of thine, which thou mad'ſt a manſion for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, an inſtrument for any wickedneſs that he would ſuggeſt unto thee, yet that that body ſhould be raiſed up; that to thy extream horror and aſtoniſhment, God would take ſuch particular care of that very body of thine, that whereſoever it were loſt, he would recover it, though diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the four winds of heaven, and build it up again (thou ſayeſt thou knoweſt for what uſe) even to be a mark againſt which he will empty his quivers, and ſhoot out all darts of his fiery indignation, in the puniſhing of whom he will expreſs his Almighty Power.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. But I cannot allow my ſelf any longer time to proſecute the former part of my Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſhew how much men deceive themſelves, who think they indeed believe the fundamental points of their Faith, when by their practice and courſe of life, they live in an habitual exerciſe of ſuch ſins, as are utter repugnant and deſtructive to ſuch a belief: And this, I think, I have performed; but yet only in general terms, not deſcending to a view of ſome more eminent and particular ſins and enormities: For that, therefore, which remains of the time that your patience will allow me, I will ſpend it in acquitting my ſelf of the other part of my promiſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in inſtancing in ſome extraordinary incontrouled practiſes of theſe times; and, diſcovering how utterly they do deſtroy the very grounds and foundations of our Religion, and how impoſſible it is they ſhould conſiſt with a true ſincere profeſſion of Chriſtianity.</p>

As firſt, for example; How ordinarily do we meet with this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, for men which are above others in wealth and power, to employ both theſe to their utmoſt abilities, for the maintaining of an unjuſt cauſe againſt a poor inferiour adverſary: I am ſure, This is no news to you, you do not ſtartle at the hearing of ſuch a crime as this: And yet, if it be well conſidered, what can be imagined more monſtrous and abominable? For,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64345:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>give me leave to ſuppoſe, or put the caſe, that ſome one of this company were guilty of this ſin.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. If I ſhould ask him, Whence and from whom he had his riches or power? whom he would acknowledge for his benefactour? I make no queſtion, but he would give me a good religious Anſwer, and ſay, That <hi>he would not ſacrifice to his net, nor burn incenſe to his dragge;</hi> but that God, who gave a bleſſing to his cares and endeavours, had advanced him to ſuch a place and fortunes in the world. Again, if I ſhould ask him, In what eſteem and valew (he thought that) God holds his faithful ſervants? or, Whether he would take it well, to have them oppreſſed and trampled on on by others more potent then themſelves? He muſt needs anſwer again, That God is no Accepter of perſons, neither riches nor poverty are a means to procure His favour, but that in all conditions of men, <hi>He that loveth righteouſneſs, and hateth iniquity, ſhall be accepted by him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="34">34. If theſe be his Anſwers (as, without all contradiction, unleſs he will profeſs himſelf an Atheiſt, ſuch muſt be the effect of them;) Then, let him conſider, in what a woful condition he has concluded himſelf to be in, and, what reaſon he has to thank God for his honour or riches? Does he think, that God has furniſhed him with ſtrength and weapons for this end, that thereby he might be able to make warr with himſelf, that he might have the power to overrun and lay waſt thoſe whom God loveth as the apple of his own eye? Can he imagine, that God has been ſo benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and liberal to him, in preferring him to a rank and degree above others not inferiour to him in the riches and treaſures of God's grace, and therefore as dear unto him as himſelf; for this end, that thereby he may prove a more able, and fit inſtrument for the Devil to wreak his malice and hatred upon thoſe whom God loves?</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Therefore, if there be ere ſuch a perſon in this Auditory (yet I hope there is not); but and if there be! What ſhall I ſay unto him? Let him conſider, what a hard task he has undertaken to warr againſt God? Let him conſider, what a ſtrange reckoning he is likely to make unto God, when he ſhall at laſt (as undoubtedly he will) require of him an account of his Stewardſhip? Behold, Lord, thou haſt given me five ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and what have I done with them? why, lo, I have made them ten talents. But how, by what courſes? Why, I have unjuſtly and injuriouſly robbed and wrung from my fellow ſervants, thoſe few talents which thou gaveſt them: I have gain'd thus much by my violent maintaining of a cauſe which thou hatedſt, and which my ſelf could not deny but to be moſt unjuſt: This is ſurely a ſore evil under the ſun. But, ſince, I hope, it little concerns any one here, to have ſuch a crime as this diſſected curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and purpoſely inſiſted upon, it ſhall ſuffice me to ſay, That they who are guilty of it, are farr from knowing of what ſpirit they are, when they ſay, they are Chriſtians, ſince even a very Heathen would abhorr to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance or entertain ſuch a vice as this.</p>

In the ſecond place, <hi>How can ye believe</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>who ſeek honour one of another, and not that honour which is of God?</hi> If theſe words of Chriſt be true, That they who too earneſtly deſire applauſe and reputation among men, neglecting, in the mean time, ſeriouſly to endeavour the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the honour which is of God; that is, obedience and ſubmiſſion to his Commands, which is that wherein a Chriſtian ought eſpecially to

                  <p n="38">38. We are ſo far from ſeeking that Honour which is of God, from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to attain unto, or ſo much as countenancing ſuch virtues, which God hath often profeſſed, that he will exalt and glorifie; ſuch is humility and patiently bearing of injuries, that we place our honour and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the contrary; that is counted noble and generous in the worlds opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which is odious and abominable in the ſight of God: If thy Brother offend or injure thee, forgive him, ſaith Chriſt; if he proceed, forgive him; What? until ſeven times? I, until ſeventy times ſeven-times. But how is this Doctrine received now in the world? what counſel would men, and thoſe none of the worſt ſort, give thee in ſuch a caſe? How would the ſobereſt, diſcreeteſt, well-bred Chriſtians adviſe thee? Why thus: If thy Brother or thy Neighbour have offered thee an injury or an affront! forgive him? By no means, of all things in the world take heed of that, thou art utterly undone in thy reputation then, if thou doeſt forgive him: What is to be done then? Why, let not thy heart reſt, let all other buſineſs reſt, let all other buſineſs and employment be laid aſide, till thou haſt his bloud: what, a mans bloud for an injurious paſſionate ſpeech, for a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful look? Nay, this is not all. That thou may'ſt gain amongſt men the reputation of a diſcreet well-tempered murderer, be ſure thou killeſt him not in paſſion, when thy bloud is hot and boyling with the provocation; but proceed with as much temper and ſetledneſs of reaſon, with as much diſcretion and preparedneſs as thou wouldeſt to the Communion: After ſome ſeveral dayes meditation, invite him mildly, and affably, into ſome retired place, and there let it be put to the tryal, whether thy life or his muſt anſwer the injury.</p>

That ever it ſhould enter into the heart of a Chriſtian to walk ſo exactly and curiouſly contrary to the wayes of God; that whereas he every day and hour, ſees himſelf contemned and deſpiſed by thee who art his ſervant, his creature, upon whom he might (without any poſſible imputation of unrighteouſneſs) pour down the vials of his fierce wrath and indignation; yet he, notwithſtanding, is patient and long-ſuffering towards thee, hoping that his long ſuffering may lead thee to repentance, and earneſtly deſiring and ſoliciting thee by his Miniſters to be reconciled unto him: Yet, that thou, for all this, for a blow in anger; it may be, for a word or leſs, ſhouldeſt take upon thee to ſend his ſoul, or thine, or, it may be, both, clogg'd and preſs'd with all your ſins unrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of (for thou canſt not be ſo wild as to think, thou canſt repent of thy ſins, and yet reſolve upon ſuch a buſineſs) to expect your ſentence before the judgment feat of God: wilfully and irrecoverably to deprive your ſelves of all thoſe bleſſed means which God had contrived for your ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the power of his Word, the efficacy and virtue of his Sacraments; all which you ſhall utterly exclude your ſelves from, and leave your ſelves in ſuch a ſtate, that it ſhall not be in Gods power to do you any good. <hi>Oh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this all ye that fight againſt God, leſt he tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver you.</hi>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:64345:235"/>for it, which cannot be, unleſs the ſoul that did before inhabit there, be diſpoſſeſſed. So it likewiſe comes to paſs in our Regeneration; there is no receiving of Chriſt, to dwell and live with us, unleſs we turn all our other gueſts out of doors. The Devil, you know, would not take poſſeſſion of a houſe, till it was ſwept and garniſhed: and, Dares any man imagine, that a heart defiled, full of all uncleanneſs, a decayed ruinous ſoul, an earthly ſenſual mind, is a Tabernacle fit to entertain the Son of God? were it reaſonable to invite Chriſt to ſup in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, much more to reſt and inhabit there?</p>
                  <p n="16">16. In the ordinary ſacrifices of the old Law, God was content to ſhare part of them with his ſervants the Prieſts, and challeng'd only the inwards as his own due. And proportionably in the ſpiritual ſacrifices, his claim was, <hi>My ſon, give me thy heart:</hi> He was tender then in exacting all his due. It was only a temptation, we know, when God required of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that his only ſon <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhould be offer'd <hi>in holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſtum,</hi> for a whole burnt-ſacrifice, to be utterly conſum'd, ſo that no part nor relicks ſhould remain of ſo beloved a Sacrifice. Yet even in thoſe old times, there were whole burnt-offerings; whereby (beſides that one oblation of Chriſt) was prefigured likewiſe our giving up our whole ſelves, ſouls and bodies, as a living reaſonable ſacrifice unto God. And therefore our Saviour Chriſt (who came to fulfil the Law, not only by his obedience thereto, but alſo by his perfect and compleat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of its force and meaning) doth in plain terms reſolutely and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily exact from all them that purpoſe to follow him, a full perfect reſignation of themſelves to his diſpoſing, without all manner of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or reſervation.</p>

24. The ſtrength and vigour of this phraſe (which expreſſes as much indeed, as all the former laid together) we ſhall the better underſtand, ſaith S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> if we conſider what it is to deny another: If a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in extream diſpleaſure, do ſo caſt off his ſon, that he denies him to be his ſon, he becomes worſe than a ſtranger; for he will not ſo much as admit him to enjoy the benefit that common humanity teacheth every man to ſhew to another; he will not endure him in his ſight, leſs will he vouchſafe to expoſtulate with him; nay, he will rejoyce when he hears of ſome misfortune that hath befaln him, and be beholding to any man that will revenge his injuries upon him.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Thus muſt every one do, who enters into league or friendſhip with God; He muſt work himſelf out of his own acquaintance; He muſt be a ſtranger, (or, if God will have him) an enemy to all the world, and eſpecially to himſelf; though he flow with wealth, yet he muſt live as being poor, <hi>as having nothing,</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul.</hi>) If affliction, or perſecution, come upon him in Gods behalf, he muſt with all joy entertain them.

But will not here be room for that earneſt Objection, which the Diſciples, in great anxiety of mind, made to our Saviour, when he was preſſing a Doctrine of the ſame nature with this we have in hand, <hi>Who then can be ſaved?</hi> If there be required at our hands, ſo abſolute and peremptory a reſignation of our ſelves to Gods diſpoſal, that we muſt root out of our hearts, all manner of love of our ſelves, or any other creature, then Chriſt hath deſtroy'd the whole ſecond Table of the Law. For, at the beſt, we are but to love our neighbours as our ſelves: If therefore our firſt leſſon muſt be to learn to contemn and deſpiſe, nay, even hate our own ſouls; why do we not with the Levites, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended even now, conſecrate every man himſelf to the Lord upon our kindred and neighbours, deſtroying all about us? Beſides, how dare we preſume to be rich, or retain thoſe poſſeſſions, which, as it ſeems, God hath bought from us? If our goods be not our own, if our ſouls
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64345:237"/>be not our own, <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> Into what a ſtrait are we faln? We are commanded to love our Brethren as our own ſouls, and we are commanded to hate our own ſouls, We are enjoyn'd to give God thanks for thoſe bleſſings which here we are enjoyn'd to caſt away. We are counſelled, even by our Saviour, to be perfect as our Heavenly Father is perfect, and yet we muſt deny our ſelves; Whereas the Spirit of God hath told us, That it is impoſſible that God ſhould deny Himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. For anſwer: This Law muſt be read and underſtood, (as the Schools ſay,) <hi>cum grano ſalis:</hi> For, though it be moſt true, that by vertue of this Precept, We are oblig'd to an utter evacuation of the love and deſire of any thing, and of all manner of confidence in our ſelves, or any other creature: Yet this muſt be underſtood, not abſolutely, but when ſuch things come in competition with our Love or Obedience to God: For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, we are moſt neceſſarily bound, to love our ſelves and others, to ſtudy and care for our own good, and the welfare of our Brethren, even to lay down our lives for them, So, that we are not bound to deſtroy the love of our ſelves, but only when it is a hinderance to our fulfilling of what God commands us.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. We therefore, who have given up our Names unto Chriſt, muſt expect to enjoy the fruits of his Obedience, by treading in the ſame ſteps which he hath left unto us. As ſhall be ſhowed hereafter more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. And yet it is not neceſſary, that we ſhould exactly and curiouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelves to the Rule of his Obedience: For, whereas he voluntarily undertook the form and faſhion of a Servant, and being Lord of Heaven and Earth, deſpiſed and neglected the riches and glory of this world: We notwithſtanding are not tyed to ſuch hard conditions, but may flow and abound with wealth and honour; neither need we to deny to our ſouls any pleaſure under the Sun, but liberally enjoy it as the gift of God, as long as thereby we withdraw not our Obedience and Allegiance from God.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. <hi>Peccatum non eſt appetitus malarum rerum ſed deſertio meliorum,</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> quoted by <hi>Lombard,</hi> 2 <hi>Sent.</hi> 42. <hi>diſt.</hi>) <hi>i. e.</hi> Sin does not conſiſt in deſiring' or luſting after things which in their own natures are evil and inconvenient, but in preferring a low inconſtant changeable good, before another more worthy and of greater excellency and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Whileſt therefore, God has that eſtimation and value in our thoughts that he deſerves, whileſt there is nothing in our ſelves, or any other creature, which we preferr before him, whilſt we conſpire not with our luſts to depoſe him from bearing a Soveraign ſway in our heats. and Conſciences, whilſt we have no other God before Him, not committing Idolatry to Wealth, Honour, Learning, and the like.

                  <p n="32">32. Conceive then the meaning of this Law to be ſuch, as if it had been more fully inlarg'd on this wiſe: Let every one that but hears any mention of Chriſt this day, take into deep conſideration, and ſpend his moſt ſerious morning thoughts, in pondering and weighing, whether thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, which Chriſt hath promiſed to communicate to every one that ſhall
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64345:237"/>be joyned and marryed to him by a lively faith, be worthy his acceptation: Let him oppoſe to them all the pleaſures and profits which he can promiſe, or but fancy, to himſelf under the Sun.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. If after a due comparing of theſe things together, he have ſo much wiſdom as to acknowledge, that an eternal weight of joy and glory, an everlaſting ſerenity and calmneſs be to be preferr'd before a tranſitory, unquiet, reſtleſs, unſatisfying pleaſure: And ſeeing both theſe are offered, and ſet before him; or rather ſeeing ſuch is the extream mercy of our God, that whereas the goods of this life, are not allow'd, nor ſo much as offer'd equally and univerſally to all, (For not many have ground to hope for much wealth, Not many wiſe, not many learned, ſaith St. <hi>Paul.</hi>) Yet to every man, whom God hath called to the acknowledgment of the Goſpel; theſe ineſtimable benefits are offered and preſented <hi>bona fide,</hi> without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible condition, ſo that (let the Diſputers of this Age, ſay what they will) it ſhall be found, that thoſe who have failed and come ſhort of theſe glories offered, may thank themſelves for it, and impute it to an actual vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary miſpriſion and undervaluing of theſe riches of Gods mercies which they might have procured, and not to any fatal over-ruling pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that did inforce and neceſſitate and drive them to their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. Theſe things conſidered, if you are indeed convinc'd, that light is to be preferr'd before darkneſs; It is impoſſible, but that you ſhould likewiſe acknowledg, that it were meer madneſs for a man to imagin to himſelf any the moſt vaniſhing faint expectation of thoſe glorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, whilſt he is buſie and careful, by all means, to avoid thoſe, indeed, thorny and unpleaſant paths that lead unto them, whilſt he promiſeth to himſelf reſt and impunity, though he walk in the Imagination of his own heart; Surely the Lord will be avenged on ſuch a perſon, and will make his fierce wrath to ſmoak againſt him.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Therefore reſolve upon ſomething, If the Lord be God follow him, ſerve him, conform your ſelves to the form of new obedience, which he hath preſcribed: But if <hi>Baal</hi> be God, if Mammon be God, if your ſelves be Gods, follow the devices of your own hearts; But by no means expect any reward at all from God for diſhonouring him, or preferring a baſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy luſt before his commands. Lo 'tis the Lord of Glory who is Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and the way too, it is he that hath profeſſed, that there is no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way of attaining unto him, but by treading in the ſame ſteps which he hath left us. A way which he found full of thorns, full of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, but hath left it to us, even ſtrowed with Roſes in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. The greateſt and moſt terrible Enemies which we can faſhion to our ſelves, are thoſe three, which St. <hi>Paul,</hi> hath muſtered together, and ordered them juſt Roman-wiſe, the ſtrongeſt in the Rear, 1. <hi>Death,</hi> and 2. the ſting of that, <hi>Sin;</hi> and 3. the poyſon of that ſting, <hi>The Law.</hi> But over all theſe, we are more then Conquerours; for it follows, <hi>Thanks be unto God, which bath</hi> (mark, hath already) <hi>given us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> At the firſt, indeed, till the paths was worn, and made ſmooth, there were ſome difficulties; for, what could the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians expect, having all the world their Enemies, but reproaches, exiles, deportations, even horrible torments and death.</p>

But we (bleſſed be our gracious God) are ſo farr from being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed with ſuch difficulties and preſſures in the way, that all thoſe are to be feared and expected by them, that dare deny the Profeſſion of our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Religion. What therefore, if the Lord had commanded ſome great thing of us, even as much as he did of his Beloved Servants, the Apoſtles, and Primitive Chriſtians, would we not have done it? How much more, when he ſays only; <hi>Be not aſhamed of me;</hi> now, when you dare not be aſhamed of me; now, that it almoſt death to be aſhamed of me: Deny not me before this generation, who would hate and perſecute you to the death, if you ſhould deny me. Crucifie unto you the unclean affections, the incendiary luſts of your hearts, which the Heathens have perform'd for the poor empty reward of fame: Preferr not riches nor honours, before me, which is no more then many Philoſophers have done for thoſe vulgar changeable Gods which themſelves have contemned.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. Having therefore (beloved Chriſtians) ſuch Promiſes to encourage us, ſuch as the poor Heathens never dream't of, and yet, for all that, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled more earneſtly after an airy phantaſtical happineſs of their own then we (to our extream ſhame be it ſpoken) do after the true one: Having ſuch advantages, even above the bleſſed Apoſtles and ancient Martyrs, Let us walk as becometh the children of God, having our eyes faſtened upon the Lord our Salvation, and conforming our ſelves freely and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrainedly to whatſoever it ſhall pleaſe him to preſcribe unto us: Not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting our own carnal reaſon and wordly wiſdom into counſel about his Worſhip, nor believing any thing which he has propos'd unto us in his Word, but for the authority of him that ſpoke it, not accepting the perſons of men, nor perſwading our ſelves to the belief of horrible and unworthy Opinions of God, becauſe men, affected by us, have ſo delivered. It was a grievous complaint, that God made by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Cap.</hi> 29. <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Their fear towards me is taught by the Commandements of men.</hi>

                  <p n="39">39. Again, we muſt ſubdue our Affections to be ruled and ſquared accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the good Will of God, rejoycing to ſee our moſt beloved ſins diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd and rebuk'd, and even crucified by the powerful Word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. Laſtly, We muſt be ready for Chriſt his ſake, to root out of our hearts, that extravagant immoderate Love of our own ſelves, that private affection, as <hi>Baſil</hi> calleth it; reſolving rather to undergo a ſhameful horrible death, then to maintain any inordinate baſe deſire, or to take part with our filthy luſts againſt our Saviour, who hath ſo dearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd us.</p>

Thus have you heard in General tearms largely, and, I fear, tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, delivered the ſum and effect of this Doctrin of Self-Denyal, (for the reſtraining of it to particular Caſes, I have reſerved to another hour): Now I will, according to my promiſe, as earneſtly as I can, inforce this neceſſary duty upon you, from the two Circumſtances before-mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. From the greater reaſonableneſs in the thing commanded; And</item>

                  </p>
                  <p n="41">41. For the firſt, namely, the reaſonableneſs of the thing commanded: To omit, how all creatures, in acknowledgment of that duty which they owe to God their Creator, do willingly ſubmit themſelves to his diſpoſition,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64345:238"/>denying their own ſpecifical private natures for the general good of the world. For example; The Elements are ſubject to alterations and depor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to be deſtroy'd and revived, to be Inſtruments of Gods favour, and again, of his wrath: Surely, Man above all the World beſide, (not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting that glorious heavenly Hoſt of Angels,) is by a more indiſſoluble Adamantine chain oblig'd and bound to his Maker; <hi>For, to which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="42">42. Again, when a great portion of thoſe glorious Spirits had muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly rebelled againſt God, and Man following the example of their prevarication, had with them plung'd himſelf irrecoverably into extream unavoidable deſtruction; In that neceſſity, God had no reſpect to thoſe heavenly Spirits, which were by nature much more admirable and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect then we; for he did in no wiſe ſaith the Apoſtle) take upon him the nature of Angels, but he took on him the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and therein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the glorious work of our Redemption.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. Surely, after this great Love, than which (I dare not ſay, God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, but) I may well ſay, he will never ſhow a greater, we, his unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy creatures, are bound to expreſs ſome greater meaſure of thankful obedience then we were for our Creation. And, yet even then, the leaſt that could be expected from us, was a full perfect reſignation of our ſelves, to the diſpoſition of that God that gave us our being. Therefore now, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a work that has coſt God all that pains and ſtudy in inventing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving, and ſo much ſorrow and labour in performing; Certainly, after all this, it is no great thing, if the Lord ſhould require our whole ſelves, ſouls and bodies, for a whole burnt-offering a Sacrifice of praiſe and thanksgiving: If he ſhould require from us our whole ſubſtance, whole Rivers of Oyl, and all the Cattel feeding on a Thouſand Hills.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. Yet now he is content, that leſs thanks ſhall ſatisfie, then was due before ever he perform'd that glorious work: Nay, he hath after all this taken off and ſubducted from that debt which we ow'd him for our Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For whereas then one actual offence againſt this Law, did neceſſarily draw along with it inevitable deſtruction; yet now, our gracious God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that we are but duſt, accepts of our imperfect ſinful obedience; nay ſometimes of the inward deſire and willingneſs to perform, where there is not power to put it in execution. Nothing then can be more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, then that a Chriſtian ſhould be commanded, not to prefer the fulfilling of his own will before Gods Will nor to ſuffer that his carnal deſires, ſhould have greater power and ſway with him, then the command of ſuch a God; or, Laſtly, not to withdraw his Allegiance and Obedience due to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and place them upon a creature, but equal, or may be, inferiour to himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. Secondly, Conſider the wonderful love and kindneſs of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, that hath already taſted unto us; taſted, nay, hath drunk the dregs of this unpleaſant bitter potion. He by whom all things were made, even the Eternal Almighty Word: He which thought it no robbery to be equal with God, became his own creature, and ſubmitted himſelf to be trod upon, reviled, hated, deſpiſed by the worſt of all creatures, cruel, ungodly, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ſinners: He of whoſe fulneſs we have all received, did utterly evacuate and empty himſelf of his Glory and Majeſty, denying to himſelf ſuch things,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64345:239"/>which he would not, even to the moſt deſpiſed creatures. For, ſaith he, <hi>The Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the air have neſts, but the Son of Man hath not whereon to lay his head.</hi>

The Lord that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the world, and can as eaſily annihilate it, Yet he hath need, and hath need of a Colt, the Foal of an Aſs. Time would fail me, for I ſuppoſe the World it ſelf would not contain the Books that might be written of his dangers, his temptations, his faſtings, his travels, his diſgraces, torments, and death; all perform'd, without any end propos'd to himſelf beſides our good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64345:239"/>and ſcandalouſly devoted; yet in the mean time, reſerve to themſelves ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a boſome, private, beloved luſt.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. You that know the ſtory of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with what a fearful name the Holy Spirit hath branded their ſin; it is called no leſs then Lying to the Holy Ghoſt: it comes near both in name and condition to that fearful ſin for which Chriſt did not dye, and for which God could yet never find mercy enough to forgive.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. Yet, conſider what this ſin was: They voluntarily ſold all the means they had, that the money, being equally divided, might ſupply the neceſsity of thoſe that wanted. Notwithſtanding, to make ſure work for ſome certain eſtate whereupon they might relie, they ſubducted ſome part of the money, and laid the reſt at the Apoſtles feet.</p>
                  <p n="52">52. <hi>S. Peter</hi> told them, that their land was in their own power; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did any conſtraint lye upon them, to enforce them to ſell all: But ſince they had profeſs'd themſelves among the number of them, which were willing to cloathe, and cheriſh, and feed Chriſt, in the perſons of their new-converted brethren: It was horrible theft, and deſperate ſying againſt God, to diminiſh one penny of the ſum.</p>
                  <p n="53">53. Now, that you may know how much this concerns you: Which of you (Beloved Chriſtians) hath not ſolemnly, and publickly, ſworn and vowed to Almighty God at your Baptiſm, not to prefer the vain pomp and vanities of this world, much leſs, the abominable crimes thereof, above your Saviour, into whoſe name you were baptized?</p>
                  <p n="54">54. Are not you then moſt ſhamefully perjur'd, when you are ſo far from renouncing the vanities of this world for Chriſt his ſake, that you will not be withdrawn from the crimes of it? When the baſe luſt of an Harlot, or the furious exceſs of Wine, or that untempting, undelightful, and therefore more unpardonable ſin of Swearing, and Blaſphemy, ſhall be of ſufficient force with you every hour, not only to withdraw all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reſpect, and obedience from Chriſt, but even to make you cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him again, and to put him to open ſhame.</p>
                  <p n="55">55. And do not pleaſe your ſelves in this conceit, that becauſe God does not exact of you now the forfeiture of your vow and promiſe, as he did of <hi>Ananias</hi> and his Wife, that therefore your caſe is much better than theirs: For, let me tell you, as our Saviour on ſuch an occaſion told the Jews: <hi>Think you that you are leſs ſinners than they whoſe bloud</hi> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <hi>mingled with the ſacrifices, or thoſe upon whom the Tower of Siloe fell?</hi> So let me ſay unto you: Think you, that becauſe God ſhewed ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible an example upon <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> for their lying to the Holy Ghoſt, by taking them away ſuddenly, by a fearful death; and hath not yet ſhewed the like upon you, that your ſin comes much ſhort of theirs, and that you may notwithſtanding eſcape? <hi>I tell you nay, but except ye repent, ye ſhall likewiſe periſh.</hi> Alas, what a trifle was that judgement which befell them, to thoſe plagues which are reſerved for wilful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate ſinners?</p>
                  <p n="56">56. I beſeech you therefore, Brethren, even by the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt, that you would conſider what it is you do, when you allow your ſelves in the practiſe of any one habitual ſin; it is no leſs then a wilful wiping off the water wherewith you were Baptized; it is no leſs than an abjuring of Chriſt: nay, it is no leſs than a devoting and ſacrificing your ſelves to Devils.</p>

It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a buſineſs, in the effecting whereof, above all the works which God ever made ſince he began to work, he moſt eſpecially glorified almoſt all his divine Attributes: It being a deliverance, even of God himſelf, from deſtruction and rottenneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is an argument ſo pleaſing to S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that in many places, he ſeems to magnifie it even to the undervaluing, and diſparagement of whatſoever Chriſt before either did or ſuffered.<note place="margin">Act. 13.</note> In a Sermon of his (<hi>Act.</hi> 13.) preached at <hi>Antioch,</hi> he makes it the complement and fulfilling of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God before had promiſed to the Fathers, and of all the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which, ſince the beginning of the world, had been delivered by Gods Meſſengers. To make which good, the Apoſtle himſelf in that place (whereas he needed not to ſtrain ſo far; there were then extant Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies enow purpoſely and preciſely decaring the glory and power of Chriſts Reſurrection) he notwithſtanding, as it would ſeem, miſtakes that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Prophecy of Chriſts Birth in thoſe words of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Pſalm:<note place="margin">Pſal. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee;</hi> and ſeemingly miſapplies them to his Reſurrection. Why, was he then indeed the Carpenter's ſon? was it a confeſſion, and not humility, that he call'd himſelf the ſon of man? Were the torments of his paſſion and death (as himſelf ſeems to intimate, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.21.) only the pangs and throws of his new birth?</p>

3. By no means: He was even in the extreameſt degree, and loweſt point of his humiliation: yea, when himſelf in that laſt terrible Agony, did ſeem to call it in queſtion; yet then alſo he was indeed the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten eternal Son of God: Or, if he had not, moſt miſerable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate had been our caſe. But by his Reſurrection, he did declare, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably, and without all contradiction, unto the world, his Glory and Majeſty: Or, to ſpeak in <hi>S. Paul</hi>'s words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>He was mightily declared to be the Son of God, by his Reſurrection from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. But we now celebrate a Feaſt, a ſeaſon of Joy and exultation, which we uſe not to do upon the memory of Gods moſt wonderful acts and exploits, though never ſo much expreſſing the glory of his Majeſty and Power; unleſs they have been beneficial unto us, unleſs they have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nearly concern'd our ſafety and happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And ſurely this great deliverance of Chriſt from the dominion and power of Hell and the Grave; when God called his Son the third time out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> this victory of his, did in a high degree import us, and advance our welfare; it had ſome more then ordinary influence upon our ſalvation; otherwiſe, this ſeaſon dedicated to the memory thereof, would not have been ſo acceptable to the primitive Chriſtians, to make them (as it were in revenge and faction againſt the late melancholy time of Faſting and repentance) for its ſake, to ſet up an Anti-Lent, and to appoint other forty daies of Feaſting and triumph, which was more (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> boaſteth) then all the ſolemn Holy-daies of the Heathen joyned together. Yea, ſo ſcrupulous were they in the celebration of this Feaſt, (quite oppoſite to the ſolemn peeviſhneſs of ſome Chriſtians of our times) that for the whole ſpace between Eaſter and Pentecoſt, as it is thought, they quite intermitted the works and exerciſe of their vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: they would not ſuffer one Faſting-day to appear; they left off their ſeverity and diſcipline, their <hi>Vigilia,</hi> and <hi>Stationes;</hi> Nay, they would not, all that time, ſo much as <hi>De geniculis adorare</hi> (in the witty barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous expreſſion of the ſame Father, in his Book <hi>De Corona Militis</hi>) they would not ſhew ſo much faint heartedneſs and dejection, as to kneel at prayers.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Therefore, in ſtead of ſaying fine things of the faſhion and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of this buſineſs of Chriſt's Reſurrection; in ſtead of raiſing matter of wonder and aſtoniſhment out of the glory and power of it; I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour (being to conclude the ſolemn celebration of this Feaſt) by way of Uſe and Application, to diſcover the iſſue and fruit thereof in reſpect of us; not only the convenience, but the extream neceſſity, and the ſtrict cohaerence, which our Salvation has, not only upon the Satisfaction and death, but upon the Reſurrection and life of our bleſſed Saviour.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Now we find many things aſcribed to Chriſts Life and Death in Holy Scripture, only as to Patterns and exemplary cauſes, being Duties which the conſideration of Chriſts Death and Reſurrection, ought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to exact from us: As, If Chriſt be dead, Then count your ſelves alſo dead unto Sin; If riſen again, then count your ſelves alive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Righteouſneſs. For how it ſhould come to paſs, that ſo much of our Holineſs as makes up mortification and no more, ſhould be aſcribed to Chriſts Death, as a proper effect and fruit thereof; And the reſt, which
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64345:241"/>is newneſs of life and obedience, ſhould be imputed to his Reſurrection, I ſhall never be able to comprehend.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The benefits therefore which accrew unto us by Chriſt, I ſuppoſe may be divided either into thoſe which flow from the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rit of his Death, or from the power and influence of his Life. In the former, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended all whatſoever Chriſt hath done for us; In the latter, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he doth or will work in us. And both being extremely neceſſary, It ſhall be this hours employment, to ſhew with what good reaſon we cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate a feaſt at this time, that we ſhould not terminate our contemplation only on the great love and bowels of compaſſions on Good-Friday ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed unto us; but alſo, and with better reaſon, on the Joy and comfort, which with great reaſon we may collect from this buſineſs of Eaſter; even that lively hope whereunto we are regenerated by the Reſurrection of Chriſt: And to joyn with <hi>S. Paul</hi> in his wonder and amazement, at the conſideration of the infinite mercy and power of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his boaſting and challenging, ſecurely, all manner of adverſaries: <hi>Who is be that ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that juſtifieth: Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died, yea rather, that is riſen again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. In which words are comprehended the great dependance and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination, which our non-condemnation or ſalvation has; not only with the death and ſatisfaction of Chriſt, but alſo rather, even with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage on his Reſurrection. Now, becauſe they are ſo few they cannot conveniently be divided, I will out of them raiſe this Doctrinal Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>
                     </label> namely, <hi>That Chriſts Reſurrection and exaltation, is fully as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and effectual to procure and perfect our ſalvation, if not more, then even the all-ſufficient Sacrifice upon the Croſs.</hi>

                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 1.</note> 
                     <hi>That the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Chriſt, who ſatisfied for our ſins, and the Covenant which he made with God, who accepted of this ſatisfaction, was not, that remiſsion of ſins ſhould immediately enſue upon his death, but only upon performance of the Conditions of the new Covenant made in Chriſts Bloud; which are, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Repentance for Sin, and a ſerious Converſion unto God by Faith.</hi> The Second: <hi>That by the Dominion and Power of Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> 2.</note> 
                     <hi>which at his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and not before, he received, as a reward of his great humility; we are not only enabled to the performance of the conditions of this new Covenant, and, by conſequence, made capable of an Actual application of his ſatisfaction; but alſo, by the ſame power, we ſhall hereafter be raiſed up, and exalted to everlaſting Happineſs.</hi> Of theſe two Propoſitions therefore in the order propoſed, very briefly, and even too too plainly. And firſt of the firſt, namely, <hi>That the purpoſe of Chriſt, who,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> I.</note> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. I confeſs, it would be no hard matter for a Diſputant, meeting with an adverſary that would be content to be ſwayed and governed by Reaſon alone; to moleſt, and even fright him from the truth of this Doctrine. For, if we ſhall conſider not only the exceſſive unſpeakable Torments which Chriſt ſuffered for us, but eſpecially the infinite Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and Glory of the Perſon, who willingly ſubmitted himſelf to that Curſe: what leſs reward can be expected, than the preſent deliverance
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64345:242" rendition="simple:additions"/>and ſalvation, not only of a few ſelected men, but even of many worlds of Men and Angels.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. But it is not for us; Beloved Chriſtians, to ſet our price and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue upon Chriſts precious Bloud, to ſay, Thus much it is worth, and no more. As there have not wanted men on the other ſide, who have dared to affirm, That Chriſts Bloud, according to exact eſtimation, did amount to a certain value, by the worth and coſt whereof, ſuch a ſet number as ſhall be ſaved, were redeem'd and purchas'd. And if one beſides ſhould be delivered, it were more than the price of the Bloud came to. What a fearful dangerous curioſity is this? Is it not a piece of <hi>Judas</hi> his ſin, to ſet our own eſtimation and value, to make a bargain, and ſale of Chriſts Death; to ſet up a kind of ſhambles to ſell his Fleſh and Bloud in?</p>
                  <p n="13">13. But leaving theſe vain phantaſtical Calculations to their chief Profeſſours, the Schoolmen, who are ſo unreaſonably addicted to this dreaming Learning, that nothing can eſcape their Compaſs and Ballance. For, to omit their curious deſcriptions and Maps of the dimenſions, and ſituation of Heaven and Hell; the Figure, Borders, Iſlands of both; They have undertaken to diſcover the exact proportionable increaſe of the graces of the Saints, eſpecially of the Bleſſed Virgin; whoſe good actions they have found to encreaſe juſt <hi>in Octupla ratione:</hi> ſo that, for example, her twentieth good action, did exceed the firſt in virtue and intention of Grace, as much as the whole earth doth exceed a grain of muſtard-ſeed.</p>

Is not this that diſeaſe which S. <hi>Paul</hi> diſcovers (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.) the effect whereof, is to make men ſick about vain queſtions, and oppoſitions of ſcience, falſly ſo called? Therefore leaving theſe vain Speculations, as likewiſe others about the buſineſs in hand, no leſs curious, and much more dangerous, yet ſecurely ſtated in theſe daies, almoſt in every Pamphlet and Synopſis. As namely, Whether God could have contrived any courſe for mans ſalvation, beſide that which he proſecuted?

                  <p n="15">15. For, what uſe or profit can be made of theſe Queſtions, though with never ſo great ſubtilty and curioſity ſtated?

By which means Gods Juſtice being intereſted in the buſineſs, the very grounds and foundation of this latter queſtion are deſtroyed, the doubt and ſcrue whereof muſt needs have been blaſphemous: namely, Whether God could have been unjuſt? Nay more, it makes the ſending of Chriſt into the world, together with his obedience to the death, even that accurſed death of the Croſs, to be a matter of no neceſſary impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; to be only a great Complement, whereby God ſhews unto man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that, though he could eaſily have remitted their ſins without any ſatisfaction (for whatſoever is poſſible to God is eaſie) notwithſtanding, that they ſhould ſee, He would ſtrain himſelf even farther for them, was very requiſite; and withall, to ſhew his abomination of ſin, he was content, that all this adoe, all theſe pompous Tragical buſineſſes ſhould be performed.</p>

16. But what ſaith the Scripture? If there had been a Law which could have given life, Chriſt ſhould have died without cauſe. And thereupon our Apoſtle (in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25.) ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.25.</note> that <hi>God hath ſet forth his Son to be a propitiation through faith in his Bloud, to declare his righteouſneſs for the remiſsion of ſins, that are paſt through the forbearance of God. To declare, I ſay, at this time his righteouſneſs, that he might be Juſt</hi> —That is, leſt by the forbearance of God, who ſince the foundation of the world had ſhewed no ſufficient example of his hatred and indignation unto ſin; as alſo to ſhew there was a reaſon ſufficient to move him to remit the ſins of many his choſen ſervants before Chriſt: He hath now at laſt evidently expreſſed unto the world his righteouſneſs; to wit, his <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="17">17. And leſt all this ſtir ſhould ſeem to have been kept only to give us ſatisfaction, and to create in us a great opinion and conceit of his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; The Apoſtle clearly ſaith, He did all this to <hi>declare at this time his righteouſneſs, that he might be Juſt.</hi> Which otherwiſe it ſeems he could not have been. But I am reſolved to quit my ſelf abruptly, and even ſullenly, of thoſe queſtions, and betake my ſelf more cloſely to the matter in hand.</p>

What therefore is the effect and fruit which accrews even to the elect of God, by virtue of Chriſts ſatisfaction, humiliation, and death, preciſely conſidered, and excluding the power and virtue of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and glorious life? Why, Reconciliation to God, Juſtification or remiſſion of ſins, and finally, Salvation both of body and ſoul. But is there any remiſſion of ſins without Faith?

                     </list> For the underſtanding of which, we muſt know, that in Chriſts death, there was not only an aboliſhing of the old Covenant of Works; the Hand-Writing which was againſt us, <hi>which Chriſt nailed unto his Croſs</hi> (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.) deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us from the curſe and obligation thereof: But alſo, there was a new gracious Covenant, or (which is a word expreſſing greater comfort to us) a new Will or Teſtament made, wherein Chriſt hath bequeathed unto us many glorious Legacies, which we ſhall undoubtedly receive, when we ſhall have performed the Conditions, when we ſhall be found qualified ſo as he requires of us.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Till which Conditions be performed by the power of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit aſſiſting us; all that we obtain by the death of Chriſt is this: That, firſt, whereas God, by reaſon of ſin,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> was implacably angry with us, would by no means accept of any reconciliation with us, would hearken to no conditions: Now by virtue of Chriſts death and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he is graciouſly pleaſed to admit of Compoſition; the former averſation, and inexorableneſs is taken away; or, to ſpeak more ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficantly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64345:243" rendition="simple:additions"/>in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s language (<hi>Eph.</hi> 2.16.) <hi>Enmity is ſlain.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, that whereas before we were liable to be tried before the throne of his exact ſevere rigorous Juſtice, and bound to the performance of Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by reaſon of our own contracted weakneſs become intolerable, nay impoſsible, unto us: we are releaſed of that obligation, and though not utterly free'd from all manner of conditions, yet tyed to ſuch as are not only poſsible, but, by the help of his Spirit which inwardly diſpoſeth and co-operateth with us, with eaſe and pleaſure to be performed. Beſides which, we have a throne of Equity and Grace to appear before. Mercy is exalted above, even againſt Juſtice; it rejoyceth againſt Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; it is become the higher Court, and hath the priviledges of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Court, that Appeals may be made from the Inferiour Court of Juſtice; to that of Mercy and favour. Nay more, whereas before we were juſtly delivered into the power of Satan, now being reconciled to God by the Bloud of Chriſt, we are (as it is in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.13.) delivered from the power of darkneſs, and tranſlated into the Kingdom of his dear Son.</p>
                  <p n="21">21 All this, and more (if it were the buſineſs of this time to be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual in diſcovering all) hath Chriſt wrought for us, being aliens and ſtrangers, yea enemies, afar off, without God in the world. Yet for all this, that Chriſt hath merited thus much for us, and more; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, take away the power of Chriſts Reſurrection, and Life; take away the influence of his Holy Spirit, whereby we are regenerated and made new Creatures; and we are yet in the Gall of bitterneſs, and Bond of iniquity. For though (as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19.) we have <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>i. liberty,</hi> and free leave, to enter into the Holieſt by the bloud of Jeſus, though there be a way made open; yet walk we cannot, we are not able to ſet forwards into it, as long as we are bound and fettered with our ſins: though there be an acceſs to the throne of Grace, yet it is only for them which are ſanctified.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. And therefore what dangerous conſequences do attend that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which teacheth, That immediately upon the death of Chriſt, all our ſins are actually forgiven us, and we effectually reconciled. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe another employment is required by this time, I will, out of many, make uſe of two Reaſons only to deſtroy that Doctrine; whereof the one is taken from the nature of the ſecond Covenant: the other, from the neceſſity of Chriſts Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. For the firſt: If we, that is, the Elect of God (for I am reſolved to have to do with none elſe at this time) be effectually reconciled to God, by vertue of Chriſts death, having obtain'd a full perfect remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all our ſins, why are we frighted; or to ſay truly, injured with new Covenants? why are we, ſeeing our Debts are paid to the utmoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the Creditor's demands exactly ſatisfied, the Obligation cancell'd; why then are we made believe that we are not quite out of danger; nay, that unleſs we our ſelves out of our own ſtock pay ſome charges and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties extraordinarily, and by the Bye inforced upon us, All the former pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, how valuable ſoever, ſhall become fruitleſs, and we to remain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comptable for the whole debt?</p>
                  <p n="24">24. But it may be (and that ſeems moſt likely) there is no ſuch thing indeed as a new Covenant: Promiſes, and Threatnings, are only a prety
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64345:243" rendition="simple:additions"/>kind of Rhetorical device, which God is pleaſed to uſe, ſometimes to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure us, and win our hearts to do that which ſhall pleaſe him; other times to ſtartle, and affright us, when we are about ſomething contrary to his command. And to ſay the truth, This muſt of neceſſity be the iſſue of the former Doctrin: For how is it poſſible to make theſe things hold together; We are already perfectly reconciled to God by the death of his Son, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſideration had to our perſonal Faith and Repentance; And yet, unleſs we do earneſtly repent us of our ſins, and with a lively Faith adhere to God's Promiſes, we ſhall never be reconciled unto God! Or theſe, All our ſins are already remitted, and that only for the vertue of Chriſt's ſatisfaction: And yet unleſs we believe, our ſins ſhall never be forgiven us!</p>
                  <p n="25">25. So that by this reckoning, we muſt be forced to purge the Goſpel of thoſe troubleſome dangerous terms of Covenants, and Conditions, of thoſe fruitleſs affrighting Conjunctions, <hi>Si Credideris, Si non poenitentiam egeris.</hi> Or (which is all one) ſoften them into a ſenſe utterly repugnant and warring againſt the natural force and ſignification of the words; on this wiſe: Where the Scripture ſaith, If thou repenteſt not, thy ſins ſhall not be forgiven thee; Thou art not to conceive, that forgiveneſs of thy ſins is a work yet to be done, or that it has any dependance upon any thing in thee: But this great bleſſing ſhall be hid from thine eyes, thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to the knowledg of it, and thereby ſhalt live here a diſcontented penſive, ſuſpicious life: Again, If thou believeſt, thou ſhalt be ſaved, that is, Thou ſhalt obtain a comfortable aſſurance of Hope, nay, an infallible faith of thy future Salvation: though that was intended thee, without any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of thy faith.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. So that the Goſpel of Chriſt, is not the power of God unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: for, How can the Word be an Inſtrument of that, which was long ago abſolutely perform'd and purchaſed? And therefore Chriſt his preaching, his miracles, and tears, The Apoſtles travels and perſecutions, The ſending of the Holy Spirit, Baptiſm, Euchariſt, Impoſition of hands, Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and many more bleſſed means of our Salvation, were not inſtituted for this end, to make us capable of Remiſſion of our Sins (for that (it ſeems) was already not only meritoriouſly, but effectually procured, and without all manner of Conditions infallibly deſtin'd to Gods Elect); but only for this end, That whilſt they live here, to their thinking, in danger and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, (but they are Fools for thinking ſo) they may now and then be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cheared and comforted with apprehending what Chriſt hath done for them, and to what a comfortable ſtate and Inheritance he hath deſtin'd them. Thus the Covenant which God hath ſworn ſhall be everlaſting, is by the improvidence and ignorance of ſome men rendred unprofitable, yea utterly abrogated: But <hi>(Ne quid inclementius dicam)</hi> we have not ſo learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. The ſecond Reaſon deſtroying the former Doctrin, I told you ſhould be taken from the neceſſity of Chriſt's Reſurrection. For, if the immediate effect of Chriſts Death, be the purchaſing of a perfect reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with God, and full remiſſion of Sins for us the Elect of God; Then (I will not ſay, what Benefit), but, What neceſſity is there of Chriſt's Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in reſpect of us? For by this accompt, after the <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs, when the ſatisfaction was perfected, and our debts pay'd:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64345:244" rendition="simple:additions"/>Though Chriſt had afterwards miſcarryed, though he had been detain'd by death, though his Soul had been left in Hell, and he had ſeen corruption; Notwithſtanding we ſhould ſtand upon good terms with God, unleſs we ſhall conceive of Him worſe then of the moſt oppreſſing Uſurer, that when a debt is diſchar'gd, and the Bond cancell'd, will notwithſtanding not releaſe the Priſoner, unleſs the undertaker come in Perſon, or by main force deliver him.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. I confeſs, that to ſee a friend that had ventur'd ſo farr for us, as our Saviour did, that to do us good had put himſelf in ſuch extream dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. I ſay, to ſee ſuch a one to be utterly caſt away, without all hopes and poſſibility of being able to pay him our thanks, would be a ſpectacle, which would grieve and pierce our very ſouls, it would be a renting to our bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. But this is only Charity and Gratitude, or good nature in us, which would procure this grief; not that it ſtands upon our ſafety, his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation being a matter only of convenience, not extream neceſſity to us.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. We all do worthily condemn and deteſt, that blaſphemous Hereſie of the Socinians, who exclude the meritorious death and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, from having any neceſſary influence into our Juſtification, or Salvation, making it of no greater vertue then the ſufferings of the bleſſed Martyrs, who by their death, ſet their Seal and Teſtimony to the Truth of the Goſpel, which freely offers forgiveneſs of ſins to all penitent believers. Now the ſame injury which theſe Hereticks do to the merit of Chriſt's death, In proportion the former doctrin fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens upon his Reſurrection, and new life, by taking from it the chief and proper effect thereof, which is an actual vindication of us from the power of ſin, into the glorious liberty of the ſons of God, by the power of Chriſts Spirit plentifully by him diffuſed and ſhed abroad in our hearts, and making the chief vertue thereof to conſiſt in affording us only matter of comfort and hope, that God will deal no otherwiſe with us, then he hath dealt with Chriſt, and after a life full of diſturbance and miſery, revive us to glory and immortality with his Son for evermore: whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath another kind of conceit of Chriſts Reſurrection: for, ſaith he, in <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. Chriſt being made perfect, (<hi>i. e.</hi> glorified, <hi>c.</hi> 2.10.) becomes Author of eternal Salvation to all that obey him: <hi>And if Chriſt be not riſen, your faith is vain, you are yet in your ſins;</hi> and <hi>if Chriſt be not riſen, neither ſhall we ever be raiſed,</hi> but be utterly irrecoverably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to everlaſting rottenneſs.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. And thus I am unawares fallen upon my ſecond Propoſition,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prop.</hi> II.</note> Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That by the Dominion and power of Chriſt, which at his Reſurrection, and not before, he received as a reward of his great Humility, we are not only enabled to the performance of the conditions of this New Covenant, and, by conſequence, made capeable of an actual application of his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; But alſo by the ſame power, we ſhall hereafter be raiſed up, and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto everlaſting Happineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="31">31. Though by the vertue of the Incarnation of our Saviour, the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature was raiſed to a ſtate and condition of unſpeakable glory: Notwithſtanding, if in this place, as well as before, we ſhall be content to ſubmit our Reaſon to Scripture, We ſhall find, that according to a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made between Chriſt and his Father, he was content not to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64345:244" rendition="simple:additions"/>to himſelf any right of Dominion and Rule over us, till he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly deſerv'd and earn'd it by a former voluntary ſubmiſsion and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. The conditions on Chriſt's part we find moſt exactly performed by him, wholly reſigning and proſtrating his own will to the will &amp; diſpoſition of his Father. At his private Paſſion, which immediately went before his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, when he was ſacrificed, and even crucified, alone in the Garden, without the aſſiſtance and malice of a trayterous Diſciple, of the chief Prieſts or Romans: Though he retain'd that innocent fear of death and ſhame which is natural to Man, which forced him to cry out, <hi>Father, if it be poſsible, let this Cup paſs from me:</hi> Notwithſtanding, though he could not hate his own life: yet, to ſhew he preferr'd the fulfilling of his Fathers will before it, he adds, <hi>Nevertheleſs, not my will, but thy will be done:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 22.42.</note> By which words he reſigns the whole power and faculty of his will into his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hands. In the words of another Evangeliſt, he ſaith, <hi>Not what I will,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark. 14.36.</note> 
                     <hi>but what thou wilt:</hi> Where he reſigns and ſubmits the Act and Exerciſe of his Will. And laſtly, to make all compleat in the expreſſion of a Third Evangeliſt, he ſaith, <hi>Not as I will, but as thou wilt:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 26 39.</note> Where he ſubjects not only the faculty and the exerciſe of his will to the performance of what God ſhall command him, but is willing and deſirous to do it after what manner and faſhion ſoever God ſhall be pleaſed. It is not poſſible for the underſtanding of man to adde or conceive a degree beyond this.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. In the next place we ſhall ſee, How God the Father is as good as his word to his Son: But, firſt, give me leave to complain to you of that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, which cuſtom, partiality, or ſomething worſe, has laid upon our Underſtandings: And that is this, That whereſoever any former Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Writer have ſuſpected a Doctrin as not beneficial, but rather dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, to ſome concluſion, which he is reſolved to maintain againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, we their Scholars are oblig'd to make good their jealouſies and (may be) groundleſs ſuſpitions.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. To omit many examples, I will produce only theſe few: It lies upon us to maintain, that St. <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm, was one and the ſame Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament with that of Chriſts, contrary to expreſs words of Scripture, and ſomething elſe: That Chriſt is a Mediatour <hi>Secundum Divinam Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram:</hi> which borders, I fear, upon an old dangerous Hereſie. As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, (which eſpecially concerns this place,) That Chriſt merited nothing to Himſelf by his Paſſion, neither was the Exaltation of his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Dominion and Rule over all Creatures a reward of his Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but a preferment due to his Perſon, though by ſpecial diſpenſation the exerciſe thereof was deferr'd for a time, but ſhould have been conferr'd upon him as fully as he now enjoys it, though he had never ſuffered.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. But Scripture reacheth us, That <hi>Chriſt was to be made perfect by ſufferings:</hi> That, <hi>Becauſe he had drunk of the Brook by the way, Therefore he ſhould lift up his head:</hi> That, <hi>For the joy which was ſet before him,</hi> (that is, Having an eye to the glorious reward and fruit of his ſuffering) <hi>he endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame,</hi> and therefore is ſet up at the right hand of Glory. <hi>Becauſe being found in faſhion as a Man,</hi>

                  <p n="36">36. This therefore I think, we ſhall agree upon, That it was the purpoſe and immutable decree of God, that after the fall and miſery of man, whatſoever good ſhould befal us toward our reſtitution and repairing to our loſt happineſs, ſhould be convey'd unto us by our own nature, <hi>That the Seed of the Woman ſhould break the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's head;</hi> That is, not only in St. <hi>John's</hi> phraſe, deſtroy the works of the Devil, but alſo in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, deſtroy his kingdom and power, which is Death. So that, <hi>As by Man came Sin and Error, ſo by Man alſo ſhould come Grace and Truth: As by Man came Death, ſo by Man alſo ſhould come the Reſurrection from the dead;</hi> By Man alſo, life and immortality ſhould be brought to light.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. Now that theſe great projects and entendments might be brought about, and that the Humane Nature might be furniſh'd with ability to diſcharge this Province, and to go through with this great Undertaking: God the Father, for the merit of Chriſt's great humility, by his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>hath highly exalted him farr above all Principality and Power,</hi>

And thus much Chriſt himſelf confeſſeth, and acknowledgeth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently upon his Reſurrection for then he ſaith, <hi>All power is given unto me in Heaven and Earth.</hi> It was then only he received the Dominion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of his Father <hi>David</hi>'s Kingdom was but a Type and ſhadow: And as his Father <hi>David</hi> was anointed and deputed by God to the Kingdom, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not actual poſſeſſion of it till after many perſecutions and afflictions at the hands of his Maſter <hi>Saul:</hi> In like manner, though our Saviour even in the days of his humility, teacheth us, that the <hi>Father judgeth no man, but reſigneth all judgment to the Son:</hi> Notwithſtanding theſe words are to be underſtood only by way of Anticipation, or Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of what ſhould befal him, after he ſhould have perform'd the work of our Redemption: For while he lived here among men, he profeſſed he was ſo farr from being a King, that he had no ſufficient authority given him to be a petty Judg in a caſe of Inheritance: And that wicked <hi>Pilas</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had power given him from Heaven to become his Judg: So that, though in the days of his fleſh, he was Heir of all things, yet he was only a conditional heir, and therefore till the conditions were perform'd, and himſelf ſeiz'd of the Inheritance, even the Heir himſelf differed nothing from a Servant.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. But within three days after his Paſſion, the caſe was much altered. For, whereas before he was allowed no Authority, no, not in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> At his Reſurrection, he obtains the Heathen for his Inheritance, and the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of the Earth for his Poſſeſſion. Now it would be a hard under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64345:245" rendition="simple:additions"/>taking to deſcribe the limits and borders of Chriſt's Kingdom; as alſo to define the Polity, whereby it is adminiſtred. Therefore, leaving the moſt glorious part of it, which is in Heaven, undiſcovered; we find in Holy Scripture, that according to the ſeveral diſpoſitions and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of men here on earth, He hath both a Scepter of righteouſneſs to govern and protect his faithful ſubjects and ſervants; and a rod of Iron, to break the wicked in pieces like a potter's veſſel. And though the greateſt part of the world will acknowledge no ſubjection to Chriſt's Kingdom; notwithſtanding, this does not take away his authority over them, no more than the murmuting, and rebellion of the Iſraelites did depoſe <hi>Moſes</hi> their Governour. But there will come a time, when that Prophetical Parable of his, ſhall be reſolved, and interpreted to their confuſion; when he ſhall indeed ſay, <hi>Where are thoſe my enemies, which would not have me to reign over them? Bring them hither, and ſlay them before me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="40">40. But the moſt eminent and notorious exerciſe of Chriſts Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is ſeen in the rule over his Church, which he purchaſed with his own Bloud: Now the firſt buſineſs he took in hand, preſently upon his Reſurrection, when all power and dominion was given him, was, to give commiſſion and authority to his Embaſſadours the Apoſtles and Diſciples, to make known to the world, that ſo great ſalvation which he had wrought at his Paſſion. Now though the Apoſtles were ſufficiently authoriſed, by vertue of that Commiſſion which Chriſt gave them in thoſe words; <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you</hi>—Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they were not to put this authority preſently in practiſe, but to wait for the ſending of the Holy Ghoſt, which Chriſt before had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them: That by his virtue and influence they might be furniſhed with abilities to go through with that great employment of reconciling the world unto God, by ſubduing mens underſtandings to the truth and obedience of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. We read in the Goſpel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of S. <hi>John,</hi> that, during the life which Chriſt lived in the fleſh, <hi>the Holy Ghoſt was not ſent:</hi> and the reaſon is added, <hi>Becauſe the Son of man was not yet glorified.</hi> The ſtrength and vigour of which reaſon, doth excellently illuſtrate the point in hand. For the ſending of the Holy Ghoſt, was one of the moſt glorious acts of Chriſts Kingly Office, and the moſt powerful means of advancing his Kingdom. Therefore, in the daies of his humiliation, whileſt he lived in the form of a ſervant, before he had purchaſed to himſelf a Church by his own Bloud, his Humane Nature obtain'd no right of dominion and power over Mankind. For till we were redeemed from the power and ſubjection of the Devil, and ſin, by the merit of Chriſts Death, we were none of Chriſts ſubjects, but ſervants and ſlaves, ſold under ſin and Satan.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. So that it being neceſſary, that the Son of man ſhould not only pay a price and ranſome for our Redemption by his Death, but alſo, that the ſame Son of man, and none elſe, ſhould actually and powerfully vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his elect from the bondage they were in, and effectually apply his merits and ſatisfaction to their ſouls and conſciences; Till he was in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.9.</note> 
                     <hi>For the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of death, crown'd with glory and honour;</hi> He, according to his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64345:246" rendition="simple:additions"/>Humane Nature (and that was the only inſtrument whereby our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation was to be wrought) had no power of ſending the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. And indeed till Reconciliation was made by his Death, to what purpoſe ſhould the Holy Ghoſt be ſent? What buſineſs or employment could we find for him on earth? You will ſay, to work grace and new obedience in us. I confeſs, that is a work worthy the Majeſty and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Gods holy Spirit. But yet, ſuppoſe all this had been wrought in us; put caſe, our hearts were ſprinkled from an evil conſcience, and that we were renewed in the ſpirits of our minds. Perhaps, all this might procure us a more tolerable cool place and climate in Hell: But without Chriſt, it would be far from advantaging us toward our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: for, alas, though we ſhould turn never ſo holy, never ſo ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and reformed: what ſatisfaction or recompence could we make for our former ſins and iniquities? God knows, it muſt coſt more to redeem a ſoul, therefore we muſt let that alone for ever; we muſt take heed of ever medling in that office, we muſt let it alone to him (even Jeſus Chriſt) who alone is able to be at that coſt.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. But I might have ſpared all theſe ſuppoſitions: For, as, excluding Chriſt, there is no ſatisfaction, no hope of redemption for us; ſo, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding Chriſts ſatisfaction, he hath no power or authority, as Man, of ſending the Holy Ghoſt, thereby to work in us an ability of performing the conditions of the ſecond Covenant; and, by conſequence, of making us capable of the fruit and benefit of his ſatisfaction. Therefore, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God the Father, for the great glory which he gave unto Chriſt; And bleſſed be our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for meriting and purchaſing that Glory at ſo dear a rate; And bleſſed be the Holy Spirit, who, when Chriſt (who is <hi>fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bone</hi>) did ſend him, would be content to come down and dwell among us.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. We find in Holy Scripture, that our Salvation is aſcribed to all the Three Perſons of the bleſſed Trinity, though in ſeveral reſpects: To the Father, who accepts of Chriſts Satisfaction, and offereth pardon of all our ſins: To the Son, who merited and procured Reconciliation for his elect faithful ſervants; And to the Holy Ghoſt the Comforter, who, being ſent by the Son, worketh in us power to perform the conditions of the New Covenant, thereby qualifying us for receiving actual remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our ſins, and a right to that glorious Inheritance purchaſed for us.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. And from hence may appear, How full of danger the former Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which teacheth, that actual remiſſion of ſins is procured to Gods Elect immediately by Chriſts death; and how diſhonourable it is to the Spirit of Grace, excluding him from having any concurrence or efficacy in our Salvation. For, if this ſhould be true, the powerful working of the Holy Spirit, can in no ſenſe, concern either our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or everlaſting happineſs. For, how can it be ſaid, that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit doth co-operate to our Salvation, ſince all our good and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was procured by Chriſts death; not only before, but without all manner of reſpect had to our Regeneration and Sanctification, by the power of the bleſſed Spirit. Therefore by this Doctrine, if we be any thing at all beholding to the Holy Spirit, it is only for this, that he is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64345:246" rendition="simple:additions"/>pleaſed, now and then, by fits; to be a meſſenger, or intelligencer, to diſcover unto us what Chriſt alone hath purchaſed for us.</p>
                  <p n="47">47. But I forbear to enlarge my ſelf further in this point; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I have already done too much wrong to the honour and dignity of this Feaſt, not only in mixing the buſineſs of Good-Friday with it, as I did in my former part; but alſo (as I now have done) in taking in the matter and imployment of Whitſuntide too. Suffice it therefore, that the ſending of the Holy Ghoſt, was an eſpecial exerciſe of that power, which was given Chriſt at his Reſurrection; by the influence and virtue whereof, we do reſtrain and appropriate the merit of his Death to our own good and benefit.</p>
                  <p n="48">48. Now I would not be miſtaken, as if I ſaid, that the Reſurrection of Chriſt preciſely taken for that individual action whereby he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to life and glory, was then effectual and powerful to produce thoſe admirable effects: For, that being a Tranſient action, paſt and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed many hundred years ſince, can very improperly be termed capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of having ſuch effects aſcribed to it as have ſince, and ſhall to the end of the world be wrought in Gods Elect. Therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhall be mine Interpreter, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. ſaying, <hi>If when we were enemies,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 5.10.</note> 
                     <hi>we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life;</hi> that is, By that glorious Life which began at his Reſurrection.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. For, as in the matter of Satisfaction, we aſcribe our reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Death eſpecially, yet not excluding his former Obedience and Humiliation; but naming that, as being the complement and perfection, terminating whatſoever went before: So likewiſe in Chriſts exaltation, though there were divers degrees, and aſcents, and ſtages of it; yet we eſpecially take notice of his Reſurrection, becauſe in that Chriſt took his riſe as it were, and was then <hi>a Bridegroom coming out of his chamber,</hi>

                  <p n="50">50. And hereby he even ſhares his Kingdom, his Power, and his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory with us: For, ſaith S. <hi>John, This is the victory whereby ye over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the world, even your Faith.</hi> Chriſt is not content only to deſtroy in us, the works of darkneſs; to diſpel the clouds of ignorance and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, or to rectifie the crookedneſs and perverſeneſs of our wills: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet to implant in us a heavie, unactive, ſleepy harmleſneſs, a dull lethargick innocence; but withal, indues us, <hi>Juſtitiâ germinante,</hi> with a fruitful budding righteouſneſs, and works in us, in the expreſſion of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> both <gap reason="foreign">

                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:64345:247" rendition="simple:additions"/>that is, one chief end of Chriſts Reſurrection, in reſpect of us, was to work in us a lively faith, whereby we might be juſtified, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted from our ſins.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. And yet the Power of Chriſts Life, leaves us not here neither: Nay, all this is performed only to make us capable of greater bleſſings yet.<note place="margin">Tertul. de Reſ. carnis.</note> For, by our ſanctification and new-birth, we are (ſaith <hi>Tertullian</hi>) <hi>Reſtitutioni inaugurati,</hi> deſtin'd and conſecrated to a glorious Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Hereupon S. <hi>John</hi> calls holineſs, the firſt Reſurrection whereby ſin is deſtroy'd: And it is a pawn of the ſecond, whereby Death alſo ſhall be ſwallowed up in victory. By the firſt, the ſting of the Serpent is taken away, which is ſin, (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The ſting of death is ſin</hi>). And when the ſting is gone, the Serpent cannot long out live it; for by the ſecond Reſurrection, that alſo is deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p n="52">52. But you will ſay, How is Death deſtroyed? Do not all men dye? Do not all men ſee corruption? You may as well ask, How is ſin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed? For, have not all men ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God? Nay, Do not all men ſin, how righteous ſoever? And, if they were rewarded according to their own demerits, would they not all come ſhort of the glory of God? Moſt certainly true: Therefore to ſay the truth, As yet, neither Sin nor Death are deſtroy'd, but only the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Sin, and the Victory of the Grave. And thereupon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle contemplating the conquering power of Chriſt at his Reſurrection, ſaith not, Oh Death, or, Oh Grave, where are you? for a little travel would ſerve the turn to aſſoyl that queſtion:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.55.</note> But, <hi>Oh Death, where is thy ſting?</hi> How comes it to paſs, that thy poyſon is not ſo keen and mortal, as it hath been; that it is ſo eaſily, though not expell'd, yet tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and corrected by the healing Bezoartical virtue of Grace. And thou, <hi>Oh Grave, where is thy victory?</hi> Though thou haſt given thine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary the foyl, though thou haſt gotten him under thee yet thou ſhalt never be able to detain him long: For, <hi>behold, a little while, and he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry:</hi> He will ranſack the moſt private reſerved corners of thy Treaſury; and though thou mayeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume and devour our bodies, yet he will force thee to vomit and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorge them again; he will not leave one portion, one morſel of them in thy ſtomach and entrails.</p>
                  <p n="53">53. I know, the ingenuous and learned <hi>Pareus,</hi> becauſe he would not ſuffer any portion of the merit of Chriſt's Death to be extended and meant to the ungodly; or, that He, by the fruit of his Paſſion, ſhould obtain any power over them, will therefore, conſequently, exclude them from the efficacy and power of his Reſurrection and Life: He will not allow them to be raiſed by the power of Chriſt, but only by the Juſtice of God to their own condemnation: So that, by his reckoning, the great buſineſs and work of the laſt day, ſhall not wholly lye upon Chriſt's hands to perform, but ſhall be parted, and ſhared between the Power of Chriſt, and the Juſtice of God.</p>
                  <p n="54">54. I am confidently perſwaded, S. <hi>Paul</hi> in this point was not of his mind, when he ſaith, <hi>As in Adam all have dyed, ſo by Chriſt ſhall all</hi> (All, without exception) <hi>be made alive again.</hi> And, <hi>As by man came death, ſo by Man alſo cometh the Reſurrection of the Dead.</hi> Indeed, I wonder <hi>Pareus</hi> would not likewiſe find ſome ſhift to exclude Chriſt, as
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64345:247" rendition="simple:additions"/>well from being a Judge to condemn the wicked: For with as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and as great eaſe, he might have given him a Writ of Eaſe, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from that Office, as well as the other.</p>
                  <p n="55">55. And now I could wiſh I had ſaid nothing all this while: (and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough ſo could you): But it grieves me, that the portion of time allowed me, will not ſuffer me in any reaſonable proportion to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the wonderful mercy and goodneſs of God; who, to do us good, has given ſuch power to our Nature in Chriſt, to make a new Heaven, and a new Earth, to reſtore a new Generation of creatures, ten times more glorious and perfect than the firſt. Only, now tell me, Did not S. <hi>Paul,</hi> with good reaſon, ſpeaking of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, give it an advantage and pre-eminence, even above his death? Is not the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, a word of great moment and weight? Since the Reſurrection of Chriſt, actuates and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the fruit of Chriſts Death, which, without it, would have withered, and been of no help to us. Is not the Doctrine of Chriſts Reſurrection and exaltation, with as good reaſon made an Article of our Creed; and as neceſſarily, if not rather, to be lean'd upon, as any of the reſt? Nay, hath not S. <hi>Paul</hi> epitomized the whole Creed into that one Article, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9.) <hi>If thou ſhalt believe in thine heart,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="56">56. And now 'tis time to conſider, who are the perſons whom the Death, yea rather, the Reſurrection of Chriſt, will protect and warrant from condemnation. In my Text, as we find none to condemn, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, we cannot light upon any to be condemned. In the verſe immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before theſe words, the Elect of God, are thoſe which are Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and therefore muſt not be condemned. And, to ſay the truth, though we diſpute till the worlds end, the event will ſhew, that the Elect of God, and only they, ſhall reap the harveſt of Chriſt's ſufferings, and bring their ſheaves with them. As for the wicked and Reprobates, it ſhall not be ſo with them: but why it ſhall not be ſo with them, whether, becauſe they have wilfully excluded themſelves, or, becauſe God had no mind they ſhould be any thing the better for theſe things, I will not tell you.</p>
                  <p n="57">57. In the verſes on both ſides of my Text, we find, that, We are thoſe that muſt not be condemn'd: We? which we? why <hi>Paul</hi> and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> What all <hi>Jews,</hi> and all <hi>Gentiles?</hi> I told you I will not tell: Only thus much let me tell you, we may boldly maintain S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s phraſe: nay, it is unſafe, and dangerous to alter it. Why, it is all the comfort we have to live by, it is our glory and crown of rejoycing, that we are thoſe whoſe ſalvation Chriſt did ſo earneſtly and unfeigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire, and thirſt after; that, to obtain power and authority to beſtow it on us, he ſuffered ſuch torments and blaſphemies, that, <hi>Never ſorrow was like unto his ſorrow, which was done unto him, wherewith the Lord af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted him in the day of his fierce wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="58">58. Wherefore, I beſeech you (Beloved Brethren) even by the bowels of this Jeſus Chriſt, that you would give me leave to adviſe you, if there be any here fit to be adviſed by me, if there be any in this company as weak and ignorant as my ſelf: (And though my heart be deceitful above all things, yet as far as I underſtand mine own heart, If I ſpeak theſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64345:248" rendition="simple:additions"/>words out of partiality or faction, let me be excluded from having my part in thoſe merits.) I ſay, let me deſire you: or rather, let our holy Mother the Church, perſwade you (in the 17. Article) to receive Gods promiſes in ſuch wiſe, as they are generally ſet forth unto us in holy Scriptures?</p>
                  <p n="59">59. For, conſider impartially with your ſelves, what an unreaſonable horrible thing is it, ſeeing there are ſo many ſeveral frequent expreſſions of Gods general love and gracious favour unto Mankind, inforc'd and ſtrengthned with ſuch proteſtations and ſolemn oaths, that the cunning'ſt Linguiſt of you all, cannot with your whole lives, ſtudy, conceive, or frame expreſſions more full and ſatisfactory. I ſay then, Is it not deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate madneſs, for a man to ſhew ſuch hatred and abomination at theſe comfortable and gracious profeſſions of God, that he can be content to ſpend almoſt his whole age in contriving and hunting after Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, utterly contradicting and deſtroying the plain apparent ſenſe of thoſe Scriptures: and will be glad and heartily comforted to hear tidings of a New-found-out Gloſs to pervert, and rack, and torment, Gods holy word.</p>
                  <p n="60">60. On the other ſide; Far be it from us to think, that it is in our power, when we liſt or have a mind to it, to put our ſelves in the number of Gods elect faithful ſervants. Or, to imagine, that we have God ſo ſure chain'd and fettered to us by his Promiſes, that we may diſpenſe now then for the commiſſion of a delightful, gainful crime: Or, that when we have buſineſs for a ſin to advantage us in our fortunes, we need not be too ſcrupulous about it, ſeeing God is bound, upon our ſorrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, to receive us again into favour. Thou wretched Fool! Dareſt thou make an advantage of Gods goodneſs, to aſſiſt and patronize thy ſecurity? 'Tis true, God has promiſed Remiſſion of ſins to a repentant contrite ſinner: but has he aſſur'd thee that he will give thee Repentance, whenſoever thou pleaſeſt to allow thy ſelf leiſure to ſeek it? No: Know, that there is a time (and preſuming Security, like ſleep, doth haſten and add wings to that time) when there will be found no way for Repentance, though thou ſeekeſt it with tears. And thus more than I meant for the perſons.</p>
                  <p n="61">61. And now what remains, but that we try an experiment: That we may know in what a comfortable ſtate Chriſt hath ſet us; let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and look about us, to ſee if we can find any enemies that are likely to do us any harm: For which purpoſe, we ſhall not meet with a more acurate Spy and Intelligencer than S. <hi>Paul:</hi> who in the remainder of his Chapter, after my Text, hath muſtered them together in one Roll. But firſt, there is one, if he were our adverſary, he would be in ſtead of a thouſand enemies unto us, and that is GOD. But him we are ſure of in the verſe before my Text: For it is he that Juſtifies, therefore ſurely he will not condemn: Therefore what ſay you to <hi>Tribulation, or Diſtreſs, or Perſecution, or Famine, or Nakedneſs, or Peril, or the Sword?</hi> Why theſe are not worthy the naming, for over all theſe we are <hi>more than conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</hi> More than conquerours; what is that?

62. Well, in the next file, there follow adverſaries of better faſhion; there is Life, and Death, and Angels, and Principalities, and Powers, (who are thoſe? In truth I know not; but be they who they will, they can do us no harm:) No, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor heighth, nor depth; (Theſe are adverſaries we ſhould ſcarce have dream'd of). And to make all ſure, in a word, There is no other creature ſhall ever be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</p>
                  <p n="63">63. Yet for all S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s exactneſs, there remains one enemy behind, and that is a ſore one, of prime note; and truly I wonder how the Apoſtle could miſs him. And that is Sin. I would to God S. <hi>Paul</hi> had taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of him: For this one enemy is able to do us more harm than all the reſt put together: nay, but for ſin, all the reſt almoſt were our very good friends. Had we beſt ſupply S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s incogitancy and even ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to put him in the Catalogue too? Well, let them that have a mind to it, do it; Truly, I dare not. And, but that I know <hi>Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> was a bold-ſpirited man, I ſhould wonder how he durſt ſo confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have adventured upon it: In his Book entituled <hi>Captivitatis Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicae</hi> (<hi>cap. de Baptiſmo,</hi> near the beginning) he hath theſe words: <hi>Vides quam dives ſit homo Chriſtianus ſive Baptizatus, qui etiam volens non poteſt perdere ſuam ſalutem quantiſcunque peccatis, niſi nolit credere.</hi> I will not tranſlate them to you: and I would they had never been Engliſhed; for by that means, it may be, ſome of our loudeſt preachers would have wanted one point of comfortable falſe doctrine, wherewith they are wont to pleaſure their friends and benefactors. Only, let us do thus much for S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s credit, to believe it was not meerly inconſideration in him to leave out Sin in this catalogue; that there was ſome ground of Reaſon for it: For though it may come to paſs, by the mercy and goodneſs of God, That even Sin it ſelf ſhall not pluck us out of his hand; yet it would be ſomething a ſtrange prepoſterous Doctrine, for a Preacher of the New Covenant, to proclaim, that we ſhall undoubtedly obtain the promiſes of the Covenant, though we never ſo much break the Conditions.</p>
                  <p n="64">64. I do confeſs my ſelf very guilty, and am ſorry that I have thus long exerciſed and wearied your patience: And yet, for all that, have not perform'd that task which I fully reſolv'd upon, when I adventured upon this ſubject; and that was, to ſpend this time in raiſing your devotions to the contemplation of the glorious mercies of God, expreſſed to us in Chriſts Reſurrection and exaltation. But becauſe other thoughts have carried me away (even againſt my will) almoſt all this while, I ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take leave to wrong and injure your patience, with propoſing one conſideration more, which ought by no means to be omitted.</p>
                  <p n="65">65. And that is, to take notice of the Perſon, to whom we have been beholding for theſe unſpeakable mercies; and that is Chriſt, Chriſt alone, none elſe mentioned or thought upon. If <hi>Bellarmine</hi> had been to adviſe S. <hi>Paul,</hi> if he had been privy to the writing of this Epiſtle, it is likely he would not have taken it ill, to have had Chriſts name in the matter of our Salvation: But he would not have endured the Apoſtles utter ſilence of all helps and aids beſides: yea, though himſelf acknowlegeth it to be the ſafeſt courſe, to put our whole confidence, only in the mercy of God; yet, <hi>quia magis honorificum eſt habere aliquid ex merito,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64345:249"/>it concerns our credit, to put in a little for merit and deſert on our ſide. He would not have us ſo to diſparage our ſelves, as to make ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation a meer Alms, proceeding meerly out of Courteſie</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Children of this world</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>are wiſer in their generation then the Children of Light.</hi> To make which good, our Saviour, in ſomuch of the Chapter as goes before my Text, brings in a Story, or, as they call it, a Parable of a cunning Fellow, yet no great Projector neither, no very ſubtile Polititian; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, one who being in an extremity, turn'd out of his Office for miſpending his Maſters Goods, had found out a ſhift, and that by meer couſenage, to procure ſo much as would ſerve to keep him, indeed not according to the Port and faſhion after which before he had liv'd; but only to maintain him in meat and drink, out of danger of ſtarving, or, which was more fearful, becauſe more full of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or diſhonour, hard labour or begging.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Surely it had been no hard matter for our Saviour, who knew all whatſoever was in man, to have diſcover'd more ſubtil projects, plots of a finer and more curious contrivance than this fellow's: But this, it ſeems, would ſerve his turn well enough for the purpoſe, for which he made uſe of it! And to ſay the truth, there cannot be imagined an example more exactly ſuiting, more cloſely applicable to his entent, which was not to diſcredit and diſhearten his followers, by comparing, I, and preferring the cunning of an ordinary fellow, a meer Bayliffe, or Steward, before that ſpiritual heavenly wiſdom to which they pretend: Nor, Secondly, to inſtruct them by indirect and unwarrantable courſes to provide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hereafter. But chiefly this,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To teach us, by objecting to our view, a man who by his own negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and careleſneſs, being brought to an extremity (for there was no neceſſity he ſhould be brought to theſe plunges; a little timely care and providence, even ordinary honeſty, would caſily have warranted and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved him) had upon the ſudden found out a trick of his Office, namely,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64345:250"/>by proceeding in his old courſes of waſting his Maſter's ſubſtance to the enriching of his Fellow-ſervants, thereby gained their good wills, that for the time following they might preſerve him from periſhing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Our Saviour, I ſay, by this example, would teach us, That ſince God has plac'd us here in this world as his Stewards, has put into our hands, his Goods, his Riches, to be diſpenſed for his uſe and advantage: And ſuch Stewards (we are) who have advantages infinitely more urgent and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing us to an honeſt faithful diſcharge of our Office, than this man in the Parable ever had; As firſt, We muſt of neceſſity fail, and be caſhier'd of our Office. All the power of Heaven and Earth cannot procure us a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity in it: The caſe did not ſtand ſo with this man, for it was meerly his own fault to deſerve diſcarding; and beſides, having deſerv'd that cenſure, it was his misfortune too, that his Lord ſhould come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, (for it is no impoſſible thing, that a Steward ſhould thrive by his Lords loſs, and yet nere be call'd to an account for it.) And ſecondly, upon our behaviour in this our Office, depends the everlaſting welfare of our ſouls and bodies; we ſhall for ever be diſpos'd of, according to the honeſt, or unfaithful diſcharge of our place: If ill, Lord what ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of us? where ſhall we appear in that great day of account? I dare not almoſt tell you the iſſue of it: But if we have carryed our ſelves as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants; propoſe to your ſelves your own conditions, give your thoughts licenſe and ſcope to be exceſſive and over-flowing in their deſires, if the whole extenſion and capacity of your thoughts be not ſatisfied and fill'd to the brim with meaſure preſſed down and running over, God himſelf (which is impoſsible to imagin) will prove a deceiving unfaithful Maſter.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Theſe things therefore conſidered, without queſtion, it doth infinitely concern us to conſult, and project, what we mean to do with our riches, to what employment we intend to put thoſe honours, and that power which God hath conferr'd on us in this life: Whether to receive them as our good things, to go away contented with them as our Rewards, our final rewards, expecting no other good things from God after them: Or, which is our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours advice, uſe them as means, &amp; helps of attaining bleſsings above all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable proportion exceeding them; ſo diſpenſing &amp; providently ſcattering them abroad, that againſt our time of need, (which ſooner or later will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly come) we may oblige to our ſelves ſuch friends, ſo gracious, and prevailing with our Maſter, who, either by their Prayers and Interceſsion, or ſome other way which we know not, may procure for us admiſsion into our Maſter's joys, to be no longer Stewards and Servants, but Friends and Sons: Thus by the help and benefit of this <hi>Mammon of unrighteouſneſs</hi> in my Text, <hi>theſe little things,</hi> even the leaſt bleſsings that God has to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon us, ſo called in the verſe following, and in the next but one to that, theſe <hi>things of other men,</hi> as if they were trifles, not worthy the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if compar'd with what rewards may be had in exchange for them, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing to our ſelves everlaſting and glorious rewards; By the aſsiſtance of our Riches (in the expreſsion of St. <hi>Paul</hi>), <hi>laying up for our ſelves a foundation of good works againſt the time to come, that we may lay hold on eternal life.</hi>

                     <item>2. This being ſuppos'd, that fail we muſt, the counſel of Chriſt comes in very ſeaſonably, namely, to provide for the main, to take order, that though we our ſelves ſink, yet we may procure us friends to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port us in our neceſſities, and that is <hi>by making to our ſelves friends of the Mammon,</hi> &amp;c.</item>

God forbid, I ſhould be ſo uncharitable, as to think, or, but ſuſpect, that ever I ſhould find occaſion to make uſe of any perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for ſuch a purpoſe. Indeed a very good man (it was the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>) once ſaid <hi>In his proſperity, I ſhall never be removed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 30.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou Lord of thy goodneſs haſt made my hill ſo ſtrong:</hi> But was this well ſaid of him, think you? It ſeems not: For preſently to confute this his confidence,<note place="margin">Verſ. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord did but turn his face away from him, and he was troubled.</hi> Yet ſurely ſuch a ſpeech as this could never be ſpoken upon better grounds; for this his aſſurance, it ſeems, proceeded not out of any preſumptuous confidence of his own ſtrength or policy: But only out of conſideration of God's eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Providence ſhow'd in his wonderful preſervation from many great and imminent dangers, and in preferring him from a low contemptible for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to the Rule and Dominion over his People.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. There is another fellow in a Parable,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.</note> who though he came ſhort of <hi>David,</hi> in this his unwarrantable confidence and preſumption upon that foundation of Riches and Wealth, which with unwearied anxiety and care he had laid up, notwithſtanding was more ſuddenly and unanſwerably confuted: For, he did not promiſe to himſelf a perpetuity, only he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd to himſelf (as he thought, reaſonably,) that ſince he had at laſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd that which he had aim'd at, and which had coſt him ſo many years travel, it were fit for him now to enjoy the fruit which he had ſo dearly bought. And in a joyful contemplation of this his happineſs he enters into Dialogue with his ſoul, <hi>Soul,</hi> ſaith he, now <hi>take thy reſt.</hi> No more ſhalt thou be vexed, and even conſum'd with the painful and violent thirſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Riches, thou haſt that laid up for thee which ſhall abundantly ſatisfie all thy deſires. All my buſineſs hereafter, ſhall be to find out ways how to repay unto my ſoul all thoſe pleaſures which heretofore I have deny'd unto my ſelf; I have ſtore ſufficient for many years ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences ſafely laid up in my Barns: Yet for all this man's thus pleaſing himſelf with aſſured promiſes of many years happineſs; If you will but vouchſafe to enquire after him the very next day after he ſpoke thus, His garners it is likely you may yet find ſtanding, throng'd and oppreſs'd with the abundance of corn. But for his ſoul (for whoſe ſake all this ado had been kept) the Lord knows what became of that, it was hurried away, no man can tell, whither.</p>

                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:64345:251"/>
9. Now the thing that it becomes me to deſire at your hands from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of theſe two Examples, is this, not to require of you to believe that you muſt once fail (for that I ſuppoſe were needleſs) nor yet to diſſwade you from allowing to your ſelves a reaſonable uſe &amp; moderate lawful pleaſures from that abundance of bleſſings wherewith God hath enriched you beyond all other men. But to beſeech you, that this meditation, that certainly you muſt fail, may be no unwelcome thought to you, that when the time ſhall come that you muſt leave theſe riches and pleaſures which God has given you here to enjoy, it may not come upon you as an unexpected misfortune, as a thing you were afraid of, and would willingly be content to avoid.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. I confeſs, this were a meditation ſufficient to diſcourage and quite diſhearten a man that were reſolv'd to take up his reſt in the pleaſures and preferments of this world, that were content to ſit down ſatisfi'd with ſuch a ſleight happineſs, as this life is able to afford him; for one who would make Riches his ſtrong City, a place of refuge and ſecurity, a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs whereto he would have recourſe in all his extremities, and from whence he would expect ſafety in all dangers and troubles which may aſſail him: For, what were that, but to withdraw him from his ſtrong holds, &amp; leave him unfortified and expos'd to any injury and misfortune! How could I be more injurious to ſuch a man, then to vex and affright him with ſuch ſad me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick thoughts as theſe, That the time will come, when that ſtrong Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of his, his Riches, ſhall be undermin'd and demoliſh'd, when he ſhall be left naked and defenceleſs. At which time, if it were poſſible for him to retain his Riches, which before he made his Bulwark and place of Security, yet he will find them then but Paper-Wals, unable to ſtand the weakeſt battery.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. But I hope better things of you, (Beloved Chriſtians) even things which accompany ſalvation: And indeed, why ſhould I not? who can forbid me to hope ſo? For alas, I know you not. I have no reaſon to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my ſelf of the contrary. And then I ſhould be moſt inexcuſably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, if I ſhould not even rejoyce in this my hope: I ſee God hath plentifully ſhowr'd down upon you, almoſt overwhelm'd you with all the bleſſings of this life. He has moreover given you peaceable times to enjoy them, (Bleſſed be his holy Name for it, and a thouſand bleſſings be return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the boſom of his Anointed for his moſt pious Chriſtian-like care to confirm this peace, and to preſerve it from interruption.) God, I ſay, has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you leiſure and opportunity to enjoy and improve theſe your riches for your everlaſting happineſs: A comfort which he has denyed almoſt to all other Nations; Nothing abroad but warrs, and rumors of warrs, no joy nor comfort but only in the effuſion of precious Chriſtian bloud, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſacking of Towns and Invaſions of Countreys, God only knows upon how juſt pretenſions. But, which is above all other bleſſings, (indeed without which all the reſt will prove very curſes) God has given you an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant plentiful uſe of his bleſſed Word and Sacraments, every week, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times (till now) a worthy and able Clergy to put you in mind, how great an account you are to make to Almighty God of theſe his bleſſings, and what extraordinary Intereſt is expected at your hards.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Let me not therefore, I beſeech you, be your Enemy, if I prove troubleſome to any ſlumbring Lethargick Spirit, if I put him in mind, that the time will come, when ſleep ſhall for ever depart from his eyes, and that if his ſlumber laſt till a Trumpet awake him, darkneſs he may find, moſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64345:251"/>palpable <hi>Aegyptian</hi>-darkneſs, but not darkneſs commodious to call on and procure ſleep, not very convenient to take ones reſt in. Forgive, I beſeech you, my importunity, if I earneſtly deſire you frequently to repreſent to your minds a time of Failing, and preſently after that a ſevere inexorable Judge, requiring a ſtrict exact account of your behaviour in your Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſhip; if I beſeech you, from the conſideration of the fooliſh Virgins, not to put farr from you the coming of the Bridegroom, not to frame to your ſelves reaſons and probabilities, why he is not likely to come yet a good while, (for he himſelf has told you, he will come as a Thief in the Night, and therefore when you are thus ſecure and ſlumbring, your ſelves create a night, a fit ſeaſon for him to come unawares upon you.) For, if you be unprovided of Oyl in your Lamps, of good works which may ſhine before men, and the dore be once ſhut, Talk not of any new devis'd Faith, and I know not what aſſurance; there is no poſſibility of ever having it open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but you ſhall be forc'd to remain expos'd to all dangers, to all manner of misfortunes, not one ſhall be found to befriend you, and to receive you into everlaſting habitations.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And, I pray you, conſider, that if the apprehenſion of theſe things conceiv'd not as preſent, but as to be expected, it may be, many years hence, be ſo diſtaſtful and ominous to fleſh and bloud, Who will be able to abide the time, when it ſhall, indeed, overtake him? If now in theſe days of leiſure and forbearance (a ſeaſon which God out of his glorious mercy hath allow'd us on purpoſe to ſpend in ſuch thoughts as theſe, in project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the evil day) the meditation thereof bring ſuch anguiſh and torment along with it; what terrible inſupportable effects will it work in us, when we ſhall find our ſelves ſurpriz'd by it, and caught as in a ſnare? If a man can no ſooner hear ſuch things related, or but ſeriouſly think upon them, though in the height of his jollity, but ſtraight, as if ſome ill news had been told him; as if he had heard ſome ſad tragical ſtory of his own misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, he will preſently recoil from his mirth, pleaſure will become trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and diſtaſtful to him; Oh with what anguiſh and vexation of ſpirit, with what agony of ſoul ſhall they be entertained, when they come in earneſt?</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Obſerve therefore, I beſeech you, that our Saviour does not bid you, When you fail make to your ſelves friends; No alas, that is not the time to make friends in; Then is the ſeaſon when you are to expect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and aſsiſtance from thoſe friends which you have gain'd before, in the time when you were furniſh'd with ſuch good things as were likely to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige men unto you. What title then can be found out equal to expreſs the folly and madneſs of ſuch people; who, as if God had created them on purpoſe for the pleaſures and vanities of this world, make that the whole buſineſs of their lives; and, as if the care of their ſouls everlaſting diſpoſal were but an employment of an hours diſpatch, will not vouchſafe ſo fruitleſsly to caſt away any part of the time, when their ſouls are vigorous and healthful, about ſuch a trifling deſign, but deſtine their laſt few hours, when they are unable for any buſineſs elſe, to ſettle for themſelves an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of eternity.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. But becauſe I have not the leiſure now to proſecute this Argument as fully, as it may deſerve; Give me leave, I pray you, in brief, to preſent to your view, a man brought to ſuch an extremity as this; One faſtened
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64345:252"/>and chain'd unto the bed of ſickneſs, one that has already receiv'd within himſelf the meſſages of death, <hi>Death beginning</hi> (in the language of the Pſalmiſt) <hi>to gnaw upon him.</hi> Take the pains, I beſeech you, to imagine to your ſelves (and it will require ſome courage but to conſider it) what unquiet buſie thoughts ſhall then poſſeſs him, what terrible affrighting meditations ſhall then be ſuggeſted to him, when he ſhall be forc'd to apprehend, that now he has but a very ſmall portion of time left him; and yet for all that, all the buſineſs for the diſparching of which he came into the world, is left undone; the counſel and good intention of God, out of which he gave him his Riches, being utterly defeated, ſcarce one friend made, that will vouchſafe to look upon him now in his neceſſity: but on the contrary, many ſore enemies procur'd, that will be ready to cry for vengeance againſt him: No account to be found of the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe goods which God has given him, but ſuch a one as will ſerve to feed and nouriſh the diſtemper and ſickneſs of his thoughts: ſo much (may be) ſpent in the proſecution and fulfilling of his ungodly luſts, ſo much in gorgeous raiment and delicious feeding, yet all this while ſcarce one poor <hi>Lazarus</hi> obliged. Now all the remedy that is to be had in ſuch an exigence as this, is to have the next Preacher ſent for, who muſt inſtill a little comfortable Divinity into him, to make him ſleep, and ſo his ſoul departs the Lord knows whither. And yet theſe are but the beginnings of ſorrows, but what the end and perfection of them will be, I confeſs I have not the courage to tell you.</p>

                  <p n="17">17. As concerning the man which was call'd the laſt hour of the day to labour in the vineyard:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I pray you take notice, that this man was a labourer, and though he took pains but for a ſhort time, yet labour he did:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64345:252"/>whereas, he that ſhall defer his repentance and amendment of life, till his laſt hour, if he indeed prove ſorry for his ſins, yet labour he cannot; the beſt that he can do, is to make offers and reſolutions to work the good work of God, if it ſhall pleaſe him to ſpare him life: But that thoſe reſolutions of his ſhall be accepted with God, in ſtead of real very labour indeed, I find no commiſſion to aſſure you. But I confeſs, it is ſomething unſeaſonably done of me, to ſtand, ſo long at leaſt, upon ſuch ſullen melancholick meditations, as thoſe are; eſpecially now in the midſt of this ſolemn glorious Feaſt: Therefore I am reſolved even abruptly to break through them, and to haſten to my ſecond General, which is the Counſel which our Saviour gives us upon this conſideration, that neceſſarily we muſt fail, namely, to provide, and ſeriouſly project againſt that time, by all the means we can make, to oblige to our ſelves friends in that extremity; expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>Make to your ſelves friends of the Mammon of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs.</hi>

Indeed I will: (for, woe unto me, if I ſhould dare to come into this place to flatter you: and woe unto me, if I ſhould dare to come into this place to vent my ſpleen againſt any). Then all this, for which there is ſuch a doe kept, not only here, but all the world over; ſuch making of friends, nay, ſuch undermining of friends; ſo many dangers ſought out and deſpis'd: This is the Mammon of unrighte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ouſneſs. An untoward name, I confeſs, for a thing ſo much ſet by, ſo carefully and ambitiouſly courted, ſo inſatiably thirſted after. But yet a name of Chriſts deviſing, He has afforded this Idol, Riches, no better a title; and therefore I muſt, and dare call them ſo, any where.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. But may it not be lawful to enquire after; or, give ſome gueſſes, at leaſt, at the Reaſons which might move our Saviour to put ſo diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a name upon Riches? Without queſtion, it is not only lawfull to be ſo curious, but alſo very uſeful and expedient. A main Reaſon (I have heard) is, becauſe ordinarily, Riches leave a tincture and infection in the perſons who have any thing to do with them. It is a hard thing, almoſt impoſſible, for a man any waies to meddle with them without ſin: ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, they are got with ſin, they are poſſeſſed with ſin, they are ſpent with ſin. A man (ſaith <hi>Siracides</hi>) cannot haſten to be rich without ſin: and when he has once got them, how unwilling will he be to let a luſt paſs unſatisfied, ſeeing he is furniſh'd with that, to which (in his opinion at leaſt) nothing can be deny'd! How unwilling will he be to be worſted, though in the moſt unjuſt cauſe, ſeeing he is furniſh'd with that which will blind the eyes of the prudent, and pervert the underſtanding of the wiſe! For (ſaith the ſame wiſe man) <hi>as a mans Riches, ſo his anger en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth.</hi> And upon the ſame grounds, it may be ſaid, that, As a mans Riches encreaſe, ſo likewiſe his Deſires and Luſts encreaſe. I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to give you one Reaſon more, why Riches are called Mammon of unrighteouſneſs; and it is, becauſe they are Mammon, Riches indeed, only to unrighteous men; none beſide ſuch, will reſt contented with them, and ſuffer God to depart from him without a greater bleſſing than they can be.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. But what need I trouble my ſelf about enquiring after reaſons, why this ſo univerſally-adored Idol. Mammon, is ſo diſhonourably branded
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64345:253"/>and ſtigmatized by our Saviour, ſince himſelf in another place has ſaid enough of it, which may ſuffice, not only to warrant the reaſonableneſs of this title; but alſo to make them, who are apt to glory ſo much in riches, if they well conſider it, even to envie the happineſs and ſecurity of thoſe who are not truſted with ſo dangerous wares. The words were ſpoken upon occaſion of a ſudden great ſorrow, and melancholy which appeared in a young mans countenance, and procur'd by the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations of Riches, which made him refuſe the moſt advantageous Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain that ever was offered to man. Whereupon, ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples (as his words are recorded by S. <hi>Matthew) Verily,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 19.23, 24.</note> 
                     <hi>I ſay unto you, that a Rich man ſhall hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. And again I ſay unto you, that it is eaſier for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for arich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed S. <hi>Mark</hi> reports this ſpeech ſomething more largely than it is there,<note place="margin">Mark 10.24.</note> and inſtead of <hi>a Rich man,</hi> puts in, <hi>One that truſteth in his Riches:</hi> Which he does not ſo much to explain the phraſe of the ſpeech, as to give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Impoſſibility.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. For, if our Saviour (in ſaying, <hi>It is impoſsible for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven</hi>) by a rich man, had meant one that truſteth in his Riches, there had been no ſufficient ground for ſo great an amazement as ſeiz'd upon the Diſciples at the hearing of it; For that was a thing which they knew well enough before; not the moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of his hearers, but could have told him as much. Therefore S. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s and S. <hi>Mark</hi>'s words joyn'd together, will make up this ſenſe (which I make no queſtion at all, but that it was Chriſts meaning) name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is even almoſt impoſſible for a Rich man to be ſav'd, becauſe he cannot chuſe but truſt in his Riches.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. And this is more clearly evinced by that ſatisfaction which our Saviour gave to his Diſciples to recover them from their aſtoniſhment; where he ſayes, <hi>With men it is impoſsible, but not with God; for with God all things are poſsible:</hi> Intimating thus much; That conſidering the great, almoſt irreſiſtable, Temptations which Riches carry along with them, and mans extream weakneſs and natural impotency; his willing propenſion, and to all ordinary natural means, moſt incurable inclination to make them his place of reſt, his ſtrong city wherein he truſts: It is impoſſible, that theſe things meeting together, he ſhould not put his confidence in them, and ſo make himſelf incapable of Heaven, between which and Riches thus uſed, there is a large, as unpaſſable a gulf as between Heaven and Hell: <hi>With men</hi> therefore <hi>theſe things are impoſsible, but not with God; for with him all things are poſsible.</hi> It is in his power, by the help and aſſiſtance of that grace which he ſhowres upon every one of us in Baptiſm, to cure this hereditary weakneſs and ſickneſs of our natures; and to render us healthful and vigorous, powerful enough to free our ſelves from that bondage and ſlavery, wherein theſe outward worldly bleſſings are apt to captive us, and whereunto by nature we do willingly ſubmit our ſelves. It is in his power to make thoſe pernicious pleaſures, which Riches may promiſe unto us, to become unwelcome and diſtaſteful unto us: Nay, which is more, it is in his power to make even this Mammon of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs againſt its own nature, to become an help and inſtrument to procure for us the true Riches, even thoſe unvaluable treaſures which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64345:253"/>God hath laid up in heaven for us. Take it not ill therefore, I beſeech you, if that, for which you are ſo much envy'd and reverenc'd above other men, be ſo undervalued by our Saviour in compariſon with the Riches; be not angry with our Saviour for it: But rather endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, by trading providently with them, for your own and others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, to render Chriſt's language in this place improper and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. But now if Riches deſerve no better a title at our Saviour's hands, how can it be likely that they can prove fit inſtruments to procure friends, and ſuch friends as we ſtand in need of? <hi>For, do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thiſtles?</hi> Indeed the argument held well on S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſide, when he ſayes, <hi>If we have ſowed to you ſpiritual things, is it much if we reap your temporal things?</hi> But will the argument hold alſo on Chriſts part; If ye have not been faithful in the Mammon of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, who will truſt you with the true Riches? Certainly, if it does not, not only this, but divers Chapters beſides, might, without any loſs, have been left out of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. And therefore it was a ſullen ill-natured fellow (he in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I mean, which received the one talent) and without all queſtion, a ſhameleſs lyar (though I fear, there be many, who are not very averſe from his opinion) who with an impudent face durſt tell God, <hi>He was auſtere, reaping where he had not ſown, and gathering where he had not ſcattered.</hi> And though he ſpake this with the ſame confidence that his Proſelytes do in theſe our daies, not as a probable opinion, but as a thing that he is aſſured of; (for, ſayes he, <hi>I know thee, that thou art auſtere,</hi> &amp;c.) Yet I beſeech you believe him not: No, no, Our God is a gracious God, and requires of us no more than we are able to do. He does not expect Faith, and Repentance, and Good Works, where he has given no abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to perform them: Nay, doth not God by his Prophet tell us, and Chriſt repeats it in his Parable, that he is ſo far from that, that after ſeveral years labour beſtowed on his vineyard, and yet no fruit iſſuing; yet he was content to expect one year longer, even till he had done ſo much, that no more could be done; he is at a ſtay, and asks, What he could have done more?</p>
                  <p n="25">25. It were therefore very fit and convenient, that we ſhould, at leaſt in our own hearts, ſilence and ſtifle ſuch opinions concerning God as theſe are. And believe, that he is a well-wiſher to us, when he beſtows any means upon us, whereby we may do good. Otherwiſe, we ſhall without any comfort or courage, heartleſly, and even ſleepily go about the performing of what Chriſt here counſels us to. If you will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me upon my word, take the mans own confeſſion: ſayes he, When I had once entertain'd this perſwaſion, that God would expect a more yielding plentiful harveſt, fruitful beyond that proportion of ſeed which he gave me to ſow, <hi>I was affraid:</hi> Horrour and uncomfortable thoughts ſeiz'd upon me, and I went and hid my talent in a Napkin, I e'en ſate ſtill, reſolv'd to put all to an adventure, and to expect what God would do with me; for, alas, how bootleſs, and to no purpoſe, would my weak endeavours be to procure the favour of ſuch a God, that would not be content but with a great deal more than lay in my power to perform.</p>
                  <p n="26">
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:64345:254"/>
26. 'Tis true indeed, Chriſt told him, that though he had had ſuch an unworthy prejudicial conceipt of him, yet that even from thence he might have been mov'd to have made the beſt and moſt advantageous uſe of that Talent, which God had beſtow'd on him; for ſayes Chriſt, <hi>If thou kneweſt I was auſtere, why didſt thou not therefore put my money into the exchangers hands, and trade with it, that I might have receiv'd mine own with increaſe:</hi> Why didſt thou not at the leaſt do thy beſt, to give ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to thy hard auſtere maſter? God forbid, that I ſhould doubt but that there are thouſands, who, though, it may be, have entertain'd this mans opinion and conceipt of God; yet make better uſe of it than he did. But yet the mans own confeſſion, ſhews what ordinarily and naturally is the fruit and iſſue of it.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. That therefore, which God ſowes among you, is Riches; but yet, Riches, moſt improperly ſo called; that which he ſcatters and ſtrews abroad, is the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs: <hi>Now, he which ſoweth</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſoweth in hope,</hi> and he which ſcattereth, ſcattereth in hope. But what gain or intereſt, what a kind of harveſt does God hope for after this his Seeds time? why juſt ſuch another as the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks of (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.) where he diſcourſes upon the Reſurrection and glorious change of theſe our bodies;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.42, 43, 44.</note> 
                     <hi>They are ſowen,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in corruption, but are raiſed in incorruption; they are ſowen in diſhonour, but are raiſed in glory; they are ſowen in weakneſs, but are raiſed in power; they are ſowen natural bodies, but are raiſed ſpiritual heavenly bodies.</hi> In like manner, God ſowes among you thoſe Riches, which himſelf, moſt diſgracefully calls <hi>the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> in hope that he may reap the true Riches: He ſcatters among you ſuch ſmall trifles, that many even Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then-men have been content to want, for the empty acrial reward of fame: nay, that ſome of them have been content to caſt away in an humour; and theſe ſmall things he ſcatters abroad, in hope that he may gather (what, think you?) the everlaſting ſalvation of your ſouls and bodies. And is this that harſh auſtere Maſter?</p>
                  <p n="28">28. Indeed, if God were ſuch a perſon as ſome men have given him out for; if he ſhould ſcatter abroad his Riches as ſnares, on purpoſe to fetter and entangle men with them. If he ſhould beſtow upon any this Mammon of unrighteouſneſs, with an intent, and reſolution, that it ſhould become unto them the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs indeed, that it ſhould make them indiſpos'd and uncapable of attaining unto the true riches; there might be ſome plea for them to faſten ſo injurious an accuſation upon God. But can the Judge of all the earth deal ſo with his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants? Can he which is Goodneſs and Mercy it ſelf, He who rejoyces to ſtile himſelf, The Preſerver of men; Can he be ſo cruelly bountiful to his creatures, as by heaping upon them, the vaniſhing, unſatisfying, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of this life, thereby to fat and cheriſh them againſt the day of ſlaughter and deſtruction? God forbid!</p>
                  <p n="29">29. I confeſs, notwithſtanding that, ſuch perſons there may be upon whom God may in his wrath ſhowr down Bleſſings, and Riches in his fierce diſpleaſure: But they are only ſuch, as by living in a continual habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual practiſe of undervaluing and contemning the daily offers of Grace and favour, have already condemn'd themſelves, and ſeal'd themſelves unto the day of deſtruction; and ſuch an one was <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> concerning whom,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64345:254"/>God himſelf teſtifies ſaying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>For this reaſon I have raiſed thee up,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exod. 9.16.</note> 
                     <hi>that I might ſhew my power in thee, and that my Name might he declared throughout all the Earth,</hi> that is, Since by thy continual Rebellions thou haſt judged thy ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of life, for this reaſon I have raiſed thee up, I have kept thee alive, and preſerv'd thee that none of my former plagues ſhould ſweep thee away, that at laſt, by an utter deſtruction of thee, together with the whole ſtrength and flower of thy Kingdom, I may be glorified throughout the whole world. But I will leave diſcourſing and come nearer unto you, in the ſerious application of Chriſts counſel here.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. It is the property of <hi>Riches</hi> (ſaith the Wiſe-man) <hi>to gather many friends:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prou. 19.4.</note> Thoſe who are above others in wealth and power ſhall preſently be furniſh'd with friends more then they can well know what to do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; But ſuch friends are not concern'd at all in our Saviour's advice in my Text; The friends here intended are ſuch, who are not here to reſtore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain unto you in the ſame coin that they received: Give not to the Rich (ſaith our Saviour) for fear they repay you. Of all things in the world, take heed of being paid back again in this life, beware how you carry your reward along with you to your Grave. But leave it to be paid in exchange in another Countrey, where for uſing five Talents well, you ſhall have ten Cities given you. Where for the bounty of a Cup of cold water, you ſhall receive a Prophet's reward. Such a friend was offered once to the Rich-man in the Goſpel, God ſent him one to his dores, even to crave his friendſhip: But the Rich-man was ſo buſied with the care of his Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe and his Table, that he was not at leiſure to hearken to ſo gainleſs an Offer: Notwithſtanding the time came afterwards, when he miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, to his coſt, perceived what a bleſſed opportunity he had moſt negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently omitted, and even in Hell attempted to purchaſe his favour, and to obtain from his hand a poor. Alms (God knows), but one drop of water; but all too late, the time of making friends was paſt, and a great unfordeable Gulf had divided them from all poſſible ſociety and communion for ever.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. Now conſider (I beſeech you) that it had been a very eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for God ſo to have provided for all his creatures, that each particular, ſhould have had enough of his own without being beholding to another for ſupply: But then two heavenly and divine Vertues had been quite loſt; For, Where had been the Poor mans Patience, and the Rich mans Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? The poor man, therefore wants that you may have occaſion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe your liberality, and that by looſing and diminiſhing your wealth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, ye may become more full of Riches hereafter. So that, it is Gods great bounty to you, not only to give you plenty and abundance, but alſo to ſuffer others to languiſh in penury and want: It may be, God has ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf ſo long to be rob'd of his own Poſſeſſions his Tithes, that you might have the glory and comfort of reſtoring them: It may be, God has ſuffered the ancient ſuperſtitious Hiſtrionical adorning of his Temples to be converted into the late ſlovenly prophaneneſs (commonly call'd worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in Spirit, but intended to be Worſhip without coſt,) that you may find a happy occaſion to reſtore thoſe ſacred places dedicated to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to that Majeſty and Reverence as may become Houſes wherein God delights that his Name ſhould dwell.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. Now, if it be not in my power to perſwade you, neither to make God nor man your debtors by your Riches: Yet I beſeech you, make
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64345:255"/>neither of them your Enemies by them: Do not make your Riches Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Warr to fight againſt God himſelf; for example, as maintaining an unjuſt cauſe by power, a cauſe which God abhorrs: Do not ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite God for his extraordinary libegality to you, as to make his Riches In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for the Devil to wreak his malice upon thoſe whom God loveth: If I had not a care not to injure your patience too farr, what might not be ſaid upon this ſubject? But, I perceive, it is fit for me to haſten to your releaſe.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. But before I quit my ſelf, and eaſe you of further proſecution of this point, I ſhall deſire you all to ſuffer one word of Exhortation, and if there be any here whom it may more neerly concern, I beſeech them even by the bowels of Jeſus Chriſt, that they will ſuffer too a word of moſt neceſſary reproof: And though what I ſhall ſay, doth not naturally flow from the words in hand, yet they bear a reaſonable reſemblance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with them: So pertinent, I am ſure, they are to the Auditory to whom I ſpeak, that I would chuſe rather quite to loſe my Text, then here to leave them unſaid.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. It is about making friends too: Indeed, not with the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs: No, that is a trifle to it. It is about making friends with not revenging of injuries, with patient bearing and willing forgiving of offences: A duty ſo ſeriouſly, ſo inceſſantly, ſometimes in plain words, ſometimes in Parables, all manner of ways, upon all occaſions, urg'd by our Saviour, that we cannot ſo much as pray, but we muſt be forc'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg, obedience to this Law, <hi>Forgive us,—As we forgive:</hi> Yea, ſo boundleſly, and without all reſtrictions or reſervations, is it enjoyn'd, That when as <hi>Peter</hi> thought it fair to have it limitted to a certain number, and propoſed Seven, as, in his opinion, reaſonable and convenient; No, faith our Saviour, Forgive not until ſeven times, but until four hundred four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten times: And if he could have imagined, that it were poſſible, for a man to have exceeded even this number alſo in injuries, without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, he would not have left there neither.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. But, How is this Doctrin received in the world? What counſel would men, and thoſe none of the worſt ſort give thee in ſuch a caſe? How would the ſobereſt, diſcreeteſt, well-bred Chriſtian adviſe thee? Why thus, If thy Brother, or thy Neighbour, have offered thee an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury or an affront, forgive him? By no means: Thou art utterly undone, and loſt in thy reputation with the world if thou doſt forgive him: What is to be done then? Why, let not thy heart take reſt, let all other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and imployment be laid aſide till thou haſt his bloud: How? a mans bloud for an injurious paſſionate ſpeech, for a diſdainful look? Nay, that is not all: That thou may'ſt gain amongſt men the reputation of a diſcreet well-tempered Murderer be ſure thou killeſt him not in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, whey thy bloud is hot and boyling with the provocation; but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with as great temper and ſettledneſs of reaſon, with as much diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and preparedneſs as thou wouldeſt to the Communion: After ſome ſeveral days reſpite, that it may appear it is thy Reaſon guides thee, and not thy Paſſion: Invite him mildly and courteouſly into ſome retired place, and there let it be determined; whether his bloud or thine ſhall ſatisfie the injury.</p>

36. Oh thou Holy Chriſtian Religion! Whence is it that thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have ſuck'd this inhumane poyſonous blood, theſe raging fiery Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits? For if we ſhall enquire of the Heathen, they will ſay, They have not learned this from us; or the Mahumetan, they will anſwer, We are not guilty of it: Bleſſed God! that it ſhould become a moſt ſure ſetled courſe for a man to run into danger and diſgrace with the world, if he ſhall dare to perform a Commandement of Chriſt, (which is as neceſſary for him to do, if he have any hopes of attaining Heaven, as meat and drink is for the maintaining of life!) That ever it ſhould enter into Chriſtian hearts to walk ſo curiouſly and exactly contrary unto the ways of God! That whereas He ſees himſelf every day and hour almoſt contemn'd and deſpis'd by thee who art his Servant, his creature, upon whom he might without all poſſible imputation of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs pour down all the Vials of his wrath and indignation, yet He notwithſtanding is patient and long-ſuffering toward thee, hoping that his long-ſuffering may lead thee to repentance, and beſeeching thee daily by his Miniſters to be reconcil'd unto him: And yet thou on the other-ſide for a diſtemper'd paſſionate ſpeech, or leſs, ſhouldſt take upon thee to ſend thy neighbours ſoul, or thine own, or likely both, clogg'd and oppreſs'd with all your ſins unrepented of, (for how can repentance poſſibly conſiſt with ſuch a reſolution?) before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal ſeat of God to expect your final ſentence: utterly depriving thy ſelf of all the bleſſed means which God has contrived for thy Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and putting thy ſelf in ſuch an eſtate, that it ſhall not be in Gods power almoſt to do thee any good. Pardon, I beſeech you, my earneſtneſs, almoſt intemperateneſs, ſeeing it hath proceeded from ſo juſt, ſo warrantable a ground; And ſince it is in your power to give rules of honour and reputation to the whole Kingdom, do not you teach others to be aſhamed of this inſeparable Badg of your Religion, Charity and forgiving of offences; give men leave to be Chriſtians without danger or diſhonour; Or, if Religion will not work with you, yet let the Laws of that State wherein you live, the earneſt deſires and care of your Righteous Prince, prevail with you: But I have done, and proceed to my laſt part, which is the convenience and gain which ſhall accrew unto us by friends oblig'd with this Mammon of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Namely, <hi>by them to be reciv'd into everlaſting habitations.</hi>

Whether this is perform'd only by their Prayers and Interceſsion with God in the behalf of their Benefactors; Or, whether they are us'd as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and conductors, as it were, as our Saviour may probably ſeem to intimate in the Parable where the Lord ſpeaks to his Servants, <hi>That they ſhould take away the one Talent from him which had no more, and beſtow it on him which had ten Talents.</hi> So uncertain it is, whether this task ſhall be performed by them one of theſe ways, or by ſome other unknown courſe, that St. <hi>Auguiſtine</hi> ingenuouſly confeſſes, he knows not what to make of it: Yet Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſays, he can eaſily aſſoil
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:64345:256"/>it, and can in theſe words find out Purgatory, and ſatisfaction for ſin af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death, and a great deal more then I can underſtand: But truly, if he be able to ſpy Purgatory in this Text, eſpecially ſuch a one as he fancies to himſelf in his Books of that Argument, he has made uſe of better glaſſes than ever <hi>Galileo</hi> found out. And I would to God, thoſe of his Party would conſider how much the weakneſs of their cauſe is argued even from hence, that they are forc'd to ground moſt of the Points contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted between us upon ſuch difficult places as theſe, of ſo ambiguous and uncertain meanings, and therefore equally obnoxious to any mans Interpretation. There may yet be found out a convenient ſenſe of this place, eſpecially, if we will allow an Hebraiſm in thoſe words (which is frequent enough in the Evangelical writings) of putting the third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon plural to expreſs a paſſive ſenſe, and then the meaning will be, <hi>That when,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>they may receive you, i. e.</hi> That ye may be receiv'd <hi>into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting habitations:</hi> Parallel to a like phraſe in Luk. 12.12. <hi>Thou Fool, this night ſhall they take away thy ſoul from thee, i. e.</hi> Thy ſoul ſhall be taken from thee. And, if this ſenſe be true, as it is very likely, many of our Romiſh Adverſaries have ſpent much pains about this Text to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. But to leave quarrelling: It is no very conſiderable matter: whether we have light upon the true ſenſe of thoſe words, or no, or whether thoſe, to whom we have done good, have a ſhare in purchaſing for us an admiſſion into theſe everlaſting habitations, as long as we may infallibly hence conclude, that though it ſhould fall out, that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould forget us, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> become ignorant of us; yet certainly, God, (who alone, is inſtead of ten thouſand ſuch friends) he will keep a Regiſter of all our good actions, and will take particular care of us, to give us a juſt proportion of reward and harveſt of glory according to our ſparingneſs, or liberality in ſowing.</p>

                  <p n="43">43. And when Fear has done its part, let Hope come in; Hope of that happy Communion; which you ſhall once again have with thoſe friends which may be purchaſed in this life at ſo eaſie a rate; Hope of that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal weight and burden of joy and glory, which is reſerved in Heaven for you if you hold faſt <hi>the rejoycing of the Hope ſtedfaſt unto the end:</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Verſ. 10.</note> And how careful and ſolicitous he was in the diſcharge of this employment and buſineſs about which his Father ſent him; this ſtory of <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> (out of which my Text is taken) will evidently and lively diſcover. For here we have a Man, that among ten thouſand one would think were the moſt unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to become a Diſciple of Chriſts, ſo indiſpos'd he was for ſuch a change, ſo unqualified in all reſpects. For firſt, he was Rich, as the third verſe tells us; and if that were all his fault, yet in our Saviour's judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was never uncharitable, being ſo clogg'd and burdened with theſe <hi>impedimenta</hi> (as even the Heathens could call Riches) it would be as hard for him to preſs through and enter in at the ſtreight gate, without uneaſing and freeing himſelf from them, as for a Camel to go through the eye of a Needle.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But ſecondly, theſe his Riches, as it would ſeem, were ſcarce well and honeſtly gotten. For his trade and courſe of life, was a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous trade, obnoxious to great, almoſt irreſiſtible, temptations: A great meaſure of grace, would be requiſite to preſerve a man incorrupt and undefiled in that courſe: and ſo ill a name he had gotten himſelf, that all that afterwards ſaw Chriſts familiarity with him, were much offended, and ſcandaliz'd at it; for we read in the 7. verſe,<note place="margin">Verſ. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>that when they all ſaw it, they murmured, ſaying, that he was gone in to lodge with a ſinful man;</hi> with one famous and notorious for a great oppreſſour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yet notwithſtanding all this, ſuch was the unſpeakable mercy and goodneſs of Chriſt, that even of this Stone, ſo ſcorned and rejected of all the people, <hi>he raiſed a ſon unto Abraham,</hi> as we find in the 9. verſe.<note place="margin">Verſ. 9.</note> And to bring this to paſs, he took occaſion even from a vain curioſity
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64345:258"/>of this <hi>Zacchaeus,</hi> an humour of his, it may be ſuch a one as afterward poſſeſſed <hi>Herod</hi> (though God knows he had not the ſame ſucceſs) name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſee ſome ſtrange work performed by Chriſt, of whom he had heard ſo much talk. This opportunity, I ſay, our Saviour took to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form an admirable miracle, even upon the man himſelf; and that he brought about by as unlikely a courſe, only with inviting himſelf to his houſe: By which unexpected affability and courteſie of our Saviour, this ſo notorious and famous Publican and ſinner, was ſo ſurpriz'd with joy and comfort, that preſently he gives over all thought and conſideration of his trade, as a thing of no moment; and being to receive Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his houſe, and knowing how ill agreeing companions Chriſt and Mammon would prove in the ſame lodging; he reſolves to ſweep it and make it clean, for the entertaining of him; he empties it of that droſs and dung wherewith before it was defiled; half of his eſtate goes away at a clap upon the poor, and the remainder, in all likelihood, is in great danger to be conſum'd by that noble and generous offer which he makes in the words of my Text: <hi>Whomſoever I have defrauded by forged cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, I reſtore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <item>1. So much of the ſatisfaction as was neceſſary to be performed, by virtue of an indiſpenſable Precept, and that is Reſtitution in theſe words, <hi>I reſtore unto him.</hi>
                        </item>

                        </item>
                     </list>
Of theſe two parts therefore, with their ſeveral particulars in the ſame order as they have been propoſed, briefly, and with all the plainneſs and perſpicuity I can imagine: And, 1. Of the former Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and therein of the firſt Particular, namely, <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> his readineſs to confeſs his Sin, in theſe words: <hi>If I,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I ſaid even now only,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>General.</hi> I.</note> It may be this was a confeſſion of his crime; but now I will be more reſolute,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Partic.</hi> 1.</note> and tell you peremptorily, this was a confeſſion: for without all queſtion, <hi>Zacchaeus,</hi> as the caſe ſtood now with him, was in no humour of Juſtifying himſelf, he had no mind to boaſt his integrity in his office: Or, if he had, he might be ſure that common fame (if that were all, yet that alone) might be a ſufficient argument, at leaſt too great a preſumption againſt him, to confute him. But to put it out of queſtion: Our Saviour himſelf, by applying the 10. verſe of this Chapter to him, acknowledgeth him for a ſinful undone man; one that had ſo far loſt himſelf in the wandring mazes of this wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world, that unleſs Chriſt himſelf had taken the pains to ſearch and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64345:258"/>enquire after him, and having found him, by the power and might of his Grace to reſcue and recover him from the errour of his ways, by reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him his eyes, whereby he might take notice towards what a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous precipice he was haſtening, there had been no poſſibility but at laſt he muſt have needs fallen headlong into the gulf of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Now it being, I ſuppoſe, evident, that <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> was guilty, and that in a high degree, and openly and ſcandalouſly guilty of the crime here diſcover'd: there is no doubt to be made, but that he who was ſo willing to unlock and diſperſe his ill gotten treaſures, would not begin to divert his covetouſneſs upon his ſins, he would not hoard them up, but would place his glory even in his ſhame; and whereas he had been the ſervant and ſlave of ſins, he would wear his ſhackles and fetters, as ſigns of the glorious victory, which through Chriſt he had won, and emblemes of that bleſſed change which he found in himſelf, being reſcued from the baſeſt ſlavery that poſſibly can be imagined, into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But it may be, you will ſay, Suppoſe <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> did freely and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily confeſs his ſin to Chriſt, who had authority to forgive him his ſins, though he had never diſcovered them: what collection ſhall be made from hence? <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> might be as bold as he would with himſelf; but as for us, his example ſhall be no rule to us; we thank God this is Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery in theſe daies, and ſince we have freed our ſelves from this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, we will not be brought into bondage to any man; we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our ſins, I warrant you, only to God, who is only able to forgive us them; as for the Miniſter, it may be, we will ſometimes be beholding to him to ſpeak ſome comfortable words now and then to us, when we are troubled in conſcience, and we have not been taught to go any further.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. I confeſs I find no great inclination in my ſelf, eſpecially being in the Pulpit, to undertake a controverſie, even where it may ſeem to offer it ſelf, much leſs to preſs and ſtrein a Text for it, for I deſire to have no adverſaries in my Preaching, but only the Devil and Sin.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>1</label> yet he) deals ſomething plainly and homely with himſelf, when he can afford himſelf no better a name than Sycophant: a title of ſo odious and hateful a ſignification, that the Devil himſelf has not got ſo diſgraceful a name as that: For he is call'd but Satan, or <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64345:260"/>by baſe delating and informing, only for the hope of a little gain to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to procure the overthrow of his neighbours eſtate and reputation; which is the condition of a Sycophant.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. From hence then we may be taught how differently we ought to behave our ſelves in the diſcovery of our own, and other mens ſins. If our brother hath offended, we are to ſoften and qualifie his ſin, to think charitably of him notwithſtanding; and to frame to our ſelves excuſes, that the matter may not be ſo bad as is generally ſuppoſed; as likewiſe hope, that hereafter, by a reformed life, he may redeem and cancel his forepaſt tranſgreſſions. And ſo we ſee even <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> himſelf (though a man of no plauſible Court-like behaviour yet) giving his advice to theſe Publicans, he would only call that an exacting more than was due, which <hi>Zacchaeus</hi> here in himſelf moſt boiſtrouſly terms Sycophancy. Whereas towards our ſelves, we muſt be tetrical and almoſt uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; we muſt not <hi>break our own heads with precious balm,</hi> as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſpeaketh, that is, by ſoftned oylely excuſes aggravate and aſſiſt our own diſeaſe.</p>

Other ſins are either too ſtreight for him, and do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually vex and gird him, ſo that he can take but little comfort in them: And ſuch are ſins againſt a mans conſtitution and temper: as for example, One act of Adultery, though for the time pleaſant, would yet afterwards more torment and afflict a covetous mans conſcience, than the devouring, it may be, of a whole Countrey. Or elſe they hang looſe about him, ſo that though they be eaſie and delightful ſometimes, yet to wear them continually, would prove tedious and irkſome. But his dearly reſpected ſin, is good company at all times for him; and, ſo he may have leave to enjoy but that, he cares not much what becomes of all the reſt.</p>

But now, that I begin to ſet my ſelf againſt his darling, only fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite ſin, the delight of his ſoul, and, as it were, the breath of his noſtrils, he will by no means endure it. What?

Am I the only perſon that he muſt aim at? Or, if he would needs be medling with me, could he not ſpare me, at leaſt, in this one ſmall ſin? Let him do his worſt to the reſt of my ſins; let him draw bloud from me in any other place beſides this: but this is a very ſucking of my hearts bloud; it is a renting to my bowels. The Lord ſurely will be merciful to me in this ſin only; <hi>Lo, is it not a little one, and my ſoul ſhall live</hi> in pleaſure and happineſs.

So that thoſe who are reſolv'd to account themſelves in this number, and to exclude from this ſociety, all others who ſuit not with their humours; ſuch, I ſay, are apt too forwardly to think all others no better than uſurpers of their patrimony and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The dangerous effects and conſequences of which Doctrine, (eſpecially where power has not been wanting to make the beſt uſe and advantage of it) was wofully diſcovered in thoſe tumults, which not very long ſince were raiſed in <hi>Germany,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> about the City of <hi>Munſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="29">29. This Doctrine I ſuppoſe was borrowed eſpecially from the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, who, upon the ſame grounds, have entituled their Catholick King to almoſt all the Weſtern parts of the world; whereby many millions of poor ſouls have been moſt unhumanely and barbarouſly maſſacred, to make way for the ſuppoſed right owners the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as we find teſtifi'd with horrour and deteſtation, even by many ingenuous honeſt-hearted writers of their own Nation.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. Neither the time nor my Text will allow me leiſure to ſtand long upon the confuting of this pernicious Doctrine, I will only oppoſe to it that ſaying of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>The Earth is the Lords, but he hath given it to the children of men:</hi> No man alive, hath any right in the goods of this world, but only by a gift from God: and by his gift, all the children of men, without exception, are inſtated in it; ſo that no pretence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or Election can be ſufficient for any one to diſſeiſe another man, of what condition or quality ſoever he be, that is once legally poſſeſſed of them.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. Therefore, whoſoever he be, that whether by fraud, or violence, or any other title, ſhall invade, or uſurp upon the rights of another, he does, as much as in him lies, without any warrant, nullifie the gift of God, and takes upon him to oppoſe and thwart his moſt wiſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; ſetting up himſelf as it were in Gods ſeat, and dethroning him, eſtabliſhing a new order of providence of his own. And thinkeſt thou that doeſt theſe things, that thou ſhalt eſcape the Judgement of God? Canſt thou imagine, that he will patiently endure to ſee his Judgements reverſed, or his Mercies evacuated by thee? That whereas he hath ſaid, <hi>I will bleſs this man, and enlarge his bounds upon the Earth;</hi> thou ſhouldeſt take upon thee to ſay on the other ſide, Let God deal as mercifully as he pleaſeth to this man; but I know what I am reſolved of, I am deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to cruſh and grind him to powder; I am reſolv'd that his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall beg at my gates, and not be ſatisfied; they ſhall bow unto me, and not be regarded. What a wretched unworthy opinion muſt ſuch a one, of neceſſity, entertain of God?</p>

                     <hi>That whoſoever he be, whoſe Conſcience ſhall convince him, that he hath gain'd any thing by an unlawful courſe, If he reſolve not to reſtore it, and dye in that reſolution, it is impoſsible he ſhould be ſaved.</hi> For the confirming of which Propoſition, inſtead of many, almoſt infinite, unanſwerable reaſons, I will only make uſe of two, each of them drawn from the impoſsibility in ſuch a man of performing two duties, moſt neceſſarily required at every mans hands that profeſſeth Chriſtianity; the one whereof is, Prayer; the ſecond, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. Concerning Prayer, I will demonſtrate, That he can neither ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly give God thanks for beſtowing upon him thoſe Riches which he calls Bleſſings; nor ſecondly, deſire Gods bleſſing upon thoſe Riches. For the firſt, Without queſtion, if ſuch a one ſhall dare to open his mouth to give God thanks for his Riches, it will prove to him a greater ſin than the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt unlawful gathering of them, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>His very Prayers ſhall be turned into ſin;</hi> For thereby he will entitle the juſt Righteous God unto his abominable ſin. Dares ſuch a man, with any confidence, give thanks to Almighty God for ſuffering him to be his Enemy in oppreſſing and perſecuting, it may be, Gods faithful beloved ſervants; for ſuffering him to be an inſtrument of the Devils? Therefore, if there be any ſuch that hear me this day, (yet I hope, nay, I am almoſt confident, there is not) but, and if there be, let me beſeech him, that of all things in the world, he will take heed of giving thanks, let him rather proceed on blindly in his ſin, and put out of his mind all thought and conſideration of God; for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Heathen could offer him ſuch an indignity as this, no not <hi>Epicurus</hi> nor <hi>Diagoras</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. In the ſecond place: How can ſuch a one deſire God to bleſs unto him, and encreaſe thoſe Riches ſo unjuſtly gotten? Will he ſay, Lord make it appear unto the world, by bleſſing me in theſe my ungodly courſes that thou likeſt well of them, and that thou haſt been of conſpiracy with me in all mine ungracious projects; ſo ſhall the godly quickly be rooted out of the earth, for every one will take advantage to wrong another; if thou wilt bleſs me, every one will be ready to tread in my ſteps. We ſee a man in ſuch a ſtate cannot ſeriouſly pray no kind of Prayer, unleſs he purpoſe to mock God to his face, ſo that he has defrauded himſelf of one neceſſary means of Salvation: But that which follows is of greater importance yet.</p>

36. There is nothing wherein a man (that is reſolv'd not to part with Goods unlawfully gathered) can dead with more deſpiteful petulancy and uncivility with God, then by offering to pretend to an unfeigned Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. It is much like the behaviour of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth unto God, who cauſed publick Prayers and Proceſſions to be made unto God for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Pope in <hi>Spain,</hi> whom himſelf at the ſame time detein'd Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in his own Caſtle St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> with a reſolution that howſoever thoſe Prayers wrought with God to pitty his Vicar, yet till he had concluded Conditions for his own advantage with him, he ſhould never be releaſed: Juſt ſuch another Enterlude, and phantaſtical Pageant muſt this mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance be.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. He will ſay, perhaps: Lord, I confeſs, I cannot juſtifie thoſe ways and courſes whereby I procur'd my wealth; it may be, to make way for my exceſs and ſuperfluity many a poor ſoul (yet richer in thy grace and favour than my ſelf) has been forc'd almoſt to ſtarve for penury and want, It may be, there are ſtore of Orphans and Widows that are importunate upon thee for vengeance againſt my unchriſtian profeſſion; and I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that for my demerits I am liable to be forc'd to drink the very dregs of thy fierce wrath and indignation for ever. I will therefore rely and caſt my ſelf upon thy mercy and pitty, which yet, if I cannot purchaſe without the loſs and reſtitution of my ill gotten wealth, I will rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture upon thy fury; And though I know it to be a fearful thing and inſupportable miſery to fall into thy hands, as into the hands of an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and purſuer; yet upon no manner of conditions will I part with my Riches; No, not though I were now upon my death-bed, being out of all hopes of ever enjoying any comfort and pleaſure my ſelf from them, and within few hours expecting to be convey'd into my everlaſting Priſon: yet rather then my Son, or my Kinſman (who even after reſtitution made of what is unlawfully got, might perhaps have remaining to him ſufficient to maintain him plentifully in this world) yet rather then he ſhall abate any thing of that vanity and ſuperfluity which my exceſs of wealth will be able to bear, I will endanger the forfeiture of my inheritance in the Land of the living.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. But it may be, you will ſay, That it is an impoſſible thing for any man that pretends to Chriſtianity, to have ſuch thoughts in him as theſe.<label type="milestone">

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:64345:263"/>of the Purchaſers: Shall ſuch men, becauſe they are not able to reſtore, be concluded in ſuch a deſperate eſtate as before I have mentioned? No, God forbid!

                     </label> that by this ſin, he hath not only wrong'd his Neighbour, but God alſo; therefore ſince he cannot find out the one, let him repay it to the other: Let him be ſo charitable, and do that kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to God, as to beſtow it in Alms upon his poor ſervants: Or, ſince God himſelf is grown ſo poor and needy, (eſpecially in this Kingdom) that he hath not means enough to repair his own Houſes, nor ſcarſe to make them habitable, He may do well to reſcue God's Churches from being habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Beaſts, and ſtables for Cattel: Or laſtly, which more concerns you, ſince God is here grown ſo much out of purſe, that he has not means enough to pay his own Servants wages equal to the meaneſt of your houſhold ſervants, let not them any longer be the mocking-ſtocks of thoſe <hi>Canaanites,</hi> your Enemies, that ſo ſwarm in your Land; Here is a ſubject fit indeed for your Charity: and a miſerable caſe it is, God knows, that they ſhould be the perſons, who of all conditions of men ſhould ſtand in greateſt need of your mercy and charity.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. Oh! but will ſome man ſay: We have found now at what the Preacher aimeth: All this ado about Reſtitution is only to enrich the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. If ſuch thoughts and jealouſies as theſe ariſe in your hearts, (as I know, by experience, it is no unlikely thing they ſhould) Oh then, I beſeech you, for the mercies of God, conſider in what a miſerable ſtate the Church muſt needs be, when the moſt likely courſe to keep the Miniſters of God from ſtarving muſt be your ſins: When thoſe to whom you have committed your ſouls in truſt, as they that muſt give God an account for them, ſhall through want and penury be rendred ſo heartleſs and low-ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, that for fear of your anger, and danger of ſtarving, they ſhall not dare to interrupt or hinder you, when you run head-long in the paths that lead you to deſtruction: When out of faint-heartedneſs they ſhall not dare to take notice, no, not of the moſt ſcandalous ſins of their Patrons, but, which is worſt, be the moſt forward officious Paraſites to ſooth them in their crimes, and cry Peace unto them, when God and their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences tell them that they are utter ſtrangers from it, and neither do, nor are ever likely to know the ways of Peace: Laſtly, when theſe Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of God ſhall be the moſt ready to tell you, that thoſe Poſſeſſions and Tithes which have been wreſted out of Gods hands are none of Gods due, that they are none of the Churches Patrimony; that their right is nothing but your voluntary Alms and charitable Benevolence, and that they ſhall think themſelves ſufficiently and liberally dealt withal, if you ſhall account them worthy to be the companions of the baſeſt &amp; meaneſt of your ſervants.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64345:263"/>I could almoſt be ſilent in this cauſe, did not our Enemies in <hi>Gath</hi> know of it, and if it were not publiſh'd in the ſtreets of <hi>Askalon,</hi> inſomuch, that you have given cauſe to the Enemies of God to blaſpheme our glorious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled Religion.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. I will conclude this Doctrin of Reſtitution moſt neceſſary certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be proſecuted in theſe times, only with propoſing to your conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations two Motives, which in all reaſon ought to perſwade you to the practiſe of it: the one ſhall be, that you would do it for your own ſakes; the other, for your childrens ſake. For the former; though I could never be ſcanted of Arguments ſufficient to enforce it, though I ſhould make it the ſubject of my Sermons to my lives end, yet becauſe, I perceive, it is time for me to haſten to your releaſe, I will only deſire you to remember how much I have told you already, that this Doctrin concerns you, ſince it is impoſſible for any man while he is guilty of the breach of this duty, to put in practiſe even the moſt neceſſary and indiſpenſable Precepts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. But concerning the ſecond Motive, which I deſire ſhould induce to the practiſe of Reſtitution, namely, that you ſhould be perſwaded to it even for your childrens ſake, I beſeech you, take this ſeriouſly into your conſideration. That whereas, it may be, you may think that by heaping wealth, howſoever purchaſed, upon your heirs, you ſhall ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them againſt all caſualties, yet, that God alſo hath his treaſures in ſtore to countervail yours, and to provide ſo, that your Heirs ſhall take but little content, God knows, in all their abundance: for, as it is in <hi>Job.</hi> 20.8. <hi>God will lay up the iniquity of ſinners for their children, i.e.</hi> He will not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelf with wreaking vengeance of other mens wrongs upon your heads that have done them, but will take care alſo, that your children ſhall be no gainers by the bargain: Therefore, as you deſire the welfare of thoſe for whoſe ſake eſpecially, you dare adventure to hazard even your own ſouls, bequeath not to them for a legacy a canker and moth, that will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly conſume and devour all your Riches: Take pitty of thoſe poor ſouls who are nothing intereſſed in their own perſons in thoſe crimes wherewith their wealth was purchaſed, and leave not unto them a curſe from God upon their inheritance. But, I ſee, I muſt be forc'd even abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to break from this Argument of Reſtitution; I come therefore, briefly, to my laſt particular, namely, the exceſs and extraordinary meaſure of <hi>Zac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus</hi> his Reſtitution, which he profeſſeth ſhall be <hi>four-fold,</hi> to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd in one word.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. However I found it ſomething a hard task to clear my firſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of Confeſſion, from the danger and neighbourhood of Popery, yet,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Partic. </seg>2</label> I fear, that in moſt mens opinions, it will prove more difficult to do as much for this: For here is an Action perform'd by <hi>Zacchaeus,</hi> (namely,<label type="milestone">

                     </label> Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Reſtitution) without all queſtion, good and acceptable to God, and yet not enjoyn'd by vertue of any Commandement, and, What is that, but plain Popiſh Super-erogation? For, the Judicial Law of reſtoring four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, is only in ſtrictneſs and propriety applicable to plain direct Stealing.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. I confeſs, that ſome particular men, for fear of this conſequence,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                     </label> have thought themſelves oblig'd to diſſent not only from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of counſels from Precepts in the Goſpel, but alſo from the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64345:264"/>uniform conſent of all Antiquity: Whereas, if we ſhall well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, they have feared where no fear was: For, our Churches never condemned that diſtinction, as if there were danger from thence of making way for Popery: But this is that abomination of a more then Phariſaical ſelf-juſtifying Pride in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that upon ſo weak a foundation they have moſt inartificially erected their <hi>Babel</hi> of Super-erogation, whereby they teach that they cannot only through the whole courſe of their lives exactly perform all the Commandements of God, without offending in any one mortal ſin; by this means chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging at Gods hands Remiſsion of their Sins, and everlaſting Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for themſelves; But alſo by their voluntary unrequired obedience unto Evangelical Counſels, leave God in arrearages unto them, and make an extraordinary ſtock of merits, which ſhall be left unto the Popes care and providence to mannage, and diſpenſe to any mans uſe for ready money. This is that Doctrin which the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in expreſs words, moſt worthily profeſſeth a deteſtation unto, in their 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article, which hath been tranſcribed into the 45<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this Church. And yet for all this, neither of theſe Churches have any quarrel to that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (when ſpeaking of voluntary Chaſtity, he ſaith, I have received no ſuch Commandement from the Lord,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.25.</note> yet I give my advice or counſel,) as hath been excellently diſcovered by the late incomparable Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> in his <hi>Reſp. ad Apologiam.</hi>

No, I dare not adventure ſo farr, I have received no ſuch Commandement from the Lord: and then, I ſhould be guilty of that which was an unjuſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation laid upon <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Ye take too much upon you ye ſons of</hi> Levi.</p>
                  <p n="47">47. Shall I then endeavour to perſwade you to conform your ſelves to this pattern of <hi>Zacchaeus,</hi> as to a Counſel? Alas the times are ſuch, that well were we if as ſome have turn'd all Counſels into Precepts, that the ſame men would not at leaſt in their practice convert all Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts into Counſel: If they would not think that the Moral Legal Precepts were antiquated and diſſolved by bringing in the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace! Or, if not quite abrogated, yet left ſo arbitrary, that they ſhould become matters of no neceſſary importance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, duties, which if we ſhall perform, we ſhall thereby approve our gratitude and thankfulneſs unto God our Saviour; and yet, if by chance they be left undone, ſince they are eſteem'd no neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the New-Covenant, there is no great danger as long as we can keep a ſpark of faith alive, as long as we can perſwade our ſelves that we have a firm perſwaſion of Gods mercy in Chriſt to our ſelves in particular (which kind of newly invented faith, an Adverſary of

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His day the wiſdome of the ancient Primitive, and, I think, Apoſtolick Church hath dedicated to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of an Epiphany, or Apparition of a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Star, which was ſent to guide the <hi>Magi,</hi> or Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Eaſt, to the place where our Saviour was born. But ſuppoſe there were ſuch a Star ſeen, and three men of the Eaſt conducted by it; muſt all the Chriſtian world preſently fall a rejoycing for it? There was reaſon indeed, that they ſhould be exceeding glad, but ſhall we therefore loſe a whole day's labour by it. To ſay the truth, there is no reaſon for it: therefore either better grounds muſt be found out for our rejoycing, or it were well done to make Chriſt-maſs a day ſhorter hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But for all this, if we well conſider it, we Gentiles might better ſpare any Holiday in the year than this; for there is none beſides this, properly our own, but the Jewes will challenge an equal intereſt in it. The appearing of the Star, then, is the leaſt part of the ſolemnity of this day: For a greater and more glorious light than the Star this day aroſe unto us, even that ſo long expected <hi>Light which was to lighten the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, which was to give light to them which ſate in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of death, and to guid our feet in the way of peace.</hi> This day, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Tit. 11.12.</note>

                     </gap>, There was an Epiphany likewiſe of the grace of God, to wit, the Goſpel; which now, as on this day, began to <hi>bring ſalvation,</hi> not to the Jews only, but <hi>to all men,</hi> even to us ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Gentiles, of whom thoſe three wiſe men were the firſt fruits. And, to ſay the truth, the appearing of Chriſt himſelf, unleſs he had brought with him this light to lighten the Gentiles in his hand, had not been ſufficient to make a Solemn day for us. The Star then <hi>was not that light, but it was ſent to bear witneſs of that light,</hi> namely, the Goſpel,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:64345:265"/>the glory whereof fills my text fuller than the Majeſty of God ever fill'd the Temple. For here we have the whole nature of the Goſpel compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and ſtraitned within the narrow compaſs of my Text, yet no part of it left out; yea, we have not only the Goſpel diſcovered by its own light as it is in it ſelf, but in compariſon with thoſe twinkling clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſtars of Jewiſh Ordinances, and that once glorious, but now eclipſed light, the Law of Works: ſince then, this is the day which the Lord hath made for us, we will rejoyce and be glad in it, and we will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to hearken, eſpecially to any thing that ſhall be ſpoken concerning our Epiphany; concerning that bleſſed light, for many ages removed out of our ſight, and as on this day beginning to appear in our Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The words of my Text, I find ſo full and ſwelling with expreſſion, ſo fruitful and abounding in rich ſenſe, that I am almoſt ſorry I have ſaid ſo much of them to fit them to this day: But, in recompence, I will ſpare the labour of ſhewing their dependance and connexion with the preceding part of the Epiſtle, and conſider them as a looſe ſevered The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis. In which is contain'd, not only the ſum and extract of this Epiſtle, but likewiſe of Chriſtian Religion in general, in oppoſition both to the Moſaical Law given to the Jews; and the Law of Works, call'd alſo the Moral Natural Law, which from the beginning of the world hath been aſſented to, and written in the hearts of all mankind. The ſenſe of which words, if they were inlarg'd, may be this. <q>

5. Firſt then of the Covenant of Grace, as it is diſtinguiſh'd from the Moſaical Law by theſe words: <hi>through the Spirit.</hi> Where we will conſider the nature of the Jewiſh Law, and wherein it is diſtinguiſh'd from the Chriſtian. When Almighty God, with a high hand and a ſtretched out arm, had reſcued the people of Iſrael from the Aegyptian ſlavery, and brought them in ſafety into the Wilderneſs, intending then to ſettle and reduce them into good order and government himſelf, and, by common voluntary conſent, they all agree to ſubmit themſelves to whatſoever laws he ſhall preſcribe unto them, as we find <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. from 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> to the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe.<note place="margin">Exod. 19.3, &amp;c. Judg. 8.</note> So that afterwards, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8. when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, after an unexpected glorious victory obtain'd by <hi>Gideon,</hi> would have made him a King, and have ſetled the government in his houſe: No,<note place="margin">V. 23.</note> ſaith <hi>Gideon,</hi> (<hi>v.</hi> 23.) <hi>I will not rule over you, neither ſhall my Son, rule over you, The Lord ſhall rule over you.</hi> And likewiſe afterward when <hi>Samuel</hi> complained to God of the perverſeneſs of the people, who were weary of his government, and would have a King, as the Nations round about them had: Thou art deceived, ſaith God, It is my govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they are weary of; <hi>They have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me,</hi> and now are riſen up in rebellion againſt me, to depoſe me from that Dominion which with their free conſents I aſſumed: For which intolerable baſe ingratitude of that Nation, in his wrath he gives them a King, he appoints his Succeſſour, which revenged thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries and indignities offered to Almighty God, to the uttermoſt upon them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Now during the time of Gods reign over them, never any King was ſo careful to provide wholeſome laws both for Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, as He was: Inſomuch, as he bids them look about, and conſider the nations round about them, If ever any people was furniſhed with Laws and Ordinances, of ſuch equity and righteouſneſs, as theirs were: which Laws, becauſe they were ordained by Angels, in the hand of a Mediator, namely <hi>Moſes,</hi> are commonly called by the name of the Moſaical Law, and are penned down at large by him in his laſt four Books.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Precepts and prohibitions of this Law, are of ſeveral natures: For ſome duties therein enjoyn'd, are ſuch as in their own natures have an intrinſecal eſſential goodneſs and righteouſneſs in them, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them, are in themſelves evil, and would have been ſo, though they had never been expreſly prohibited: Such are eſpecially the 10. Words or Precepts written by Gods own finger in the two Tables of ſtone: Other Precepts concern matters of their own nature indifferent, and are only to be termed good, becauſe they were commanded by a poſitive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law; ſuch are the Ceremonial Waſhings, Purifications, Sacrifices, &amp;c. A third ſort are of a mixt nature, the objects of which, are for the moſt part, things in their own nature, good or evil; but yet the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances annex'd unto them, are meerly arbitrary and alterable, as namely, thoſe things which are commanded or forbidden by that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Judicial Law: for example: The Law of fourfold Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of things ſtollen. Theft of its own nature is evil, and deſerves pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: But that the puniſhment thereof ſhould be ſuch a kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, is not in it ſelf neceſſary, but may be chang'd either into a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64345:266"/>puniſhment, or, it may be, into a civil death, according as thoſe who have the government of Kingdoms and States ſhall think fit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the diſpoſitions of the times wherein they live, as we ſee by experience in the practiſe of our own Kingdoms. For the due execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which Laws, and puniſhment of tranſgreſſours, God appointed Judges and Rulers; and where they failed through want of care or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, himſelf many times would immediately and perſonally inflict the puniſhment.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Now the general Sanction of this whole Law is expreſſed <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. <hi>v.</hi> 26 in theſe words,<note place="margin">Deut. 27.26.</note> 
                     <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all the words of this Law to do them:</hi> which curſe, as we find it afterwards at large interpreted, imported a ſudden violent untimely death, together with all kind of misfortune, that could make this life miſerable: ſo that he was liable to this curſe that ſwerved in any one point or circumſtance, from what was contained in that Law. Notwithſtanding, in ſome caſes, God was pleaſed to remit the rigour of this curſe, and to except of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain gifts and offerings, and the expiatory ſacrifices of beaſts, as it were, in exchange for the lives of the delinquents. I ſhould but fruitleſly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle away the time in inſiſting any longer upon the nature and quality of the Moſaical Law. I will now, as I am required by my Text, ſhew you the extream difference, and incomparable excellency of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, or the Goſpel beyond this, in ſeveral reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. As firſt: The Moral Duties of the two Tables, as they are part of the Moſaical Jewiſh Law required only an external obedience and conformity to the Affirmative precepts thereof, and an abſtaining from an outward practiſe of the Negative. They did not reach unto the conſcience, no more then the National Laws of other Kingdoms do: ſo that for example, where the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> forbids. Adultery upon pain of death, he that ſhould in his heart luſt with any woman, could not be accounted a tranſgreſſour of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, neither was he liable to the puniſhment therein ſpecified: whereas the Goſpel requires not only an outward, and, as I may ſay, corporal obedience to Gods commandements, but alſo an inward ſanctification of the ſoul and conſcience upon the ſame penalty of everlaſting damnation with the former. And what is now ſaid of the moral precepts (as they art part of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law) by the ſame proportion likewiſe, is to be underſtood of the Judicial.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Notwithſtanding what hath now been ſaid: yet we muſt know, that theſe very Jews, to whom this Law was given, being the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> were heirs likewiſe of the promiſes which were made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him and his ſeed; And the way or means whereby they were to attain unto theſe promiſes, were the very ſame by which himſelf obtained them, namely, Faith. So that this Moſaical Law (whatſoever glorious opinion the Jews had of it) was not that Covenant whereby they were to ſeek for Juſtification in the ſight of God. Till Chriſt's coming, there was no Law given, which could have given life, that is, which could promiſe everlaſting life unto man; not the Law of works by reaſon of mans im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection and weakneſs; not the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> by reaſon of its own weakneſs, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> clearly demonſtrates, eſpecially in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the Hebrews.</p>
                  <p n="11">
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:64345:267"/>
11. For what end then was the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> given? S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhall anſwer the queſtion,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.19.</note> 
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. It <hi>was added</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe of tranſgreſsions, till the ſeed ſhould come to whom the promiſes were made.</hi> It was added, as if he ſhould ſay, After the promiſes made unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his ſeed, this Law was moreover annexed, not as any new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition whereby they were to attain unto the promiſes, but that, in the mean time, till the promiſes were fulfilled, they ſhould be reſtrained, as it were, and kept under a ſtrict outward diſcipline, from running into any exceſs of diſobedience: for thoſe, whom perhaps the goodneſs and mercy of God, in affording them thoſe promiſes, would not by the hope of them be able to bridle, they notwithſtanding, when they ſaw puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment even unto death without mercy inflicted upon the tranſgreſſours, they would be more careful of their waies. It followes, <hi>Till the ſeed ſhould come to whom the promiſes were made;</hi> or as himſelf in <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. alters the phraſe,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.10.</note> 
                     <hi>till the time of reformation:</hi> that is, When Chriſt, who was that bleſſed Seed, promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſhould come, he would ſo clearly and convincingly ſhew unto the world the way of Salvation, that they ſhould no longer need to be kept under their old Schoolmaſter, the Law; and therefore at his coming, the date of the whole Moſaical Law ſhould expire. And that may be one reaſon why S. <hi>Paul</hi> is in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo violent againſt thoſe that would urge the obſervation of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Law; foraſmuch as by inforcing it now when the ſeed was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come, to whom the promiſes were made, they did ſeem to evacuate the Coming and Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Now, that the Moſaical Law was not given to the Jews for this end, that by the fulfilling thereof, they ſhould promiſe to themſelves the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of righteouſneſs, everlaſting life; is evidently demonſtrated, both by our Saviour in the 5. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and by S. <hi>Paul</hi> through all his Epiſtles, but eſpecially in that to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> The force and vertue of whoſe arguments, may in general be reduc'd to that iſſue which before I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Law, by the performance whereof we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect life, requires not only an external conformity to the outward works, but an inward ſpiritual ſanctification alſo of the ſoul and heart.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. But what ſaith the Law of <hi>Meſes? It was ſaid,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>by them of old,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 5.21.</note> 
                     <hi>i.</hi> in the Law of <hi>Moſes, Thou ſhalt not kill;</hi> not, Thou ſhalt not be angry, thou ſhalt not bear malice in thy heart: ſo that if thou abſtaineſt from Murder, thou fulfilleſt <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law; <hi>And if thou doeſt kill, thou ſhalt be in danger of Judgement, i.</hi> the only puniſhment which the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> inflicted upon the tranſgreſſours thereof, was the danger to be condemn'd to death by the Judgement, or Bench of Judges appointed for the execution of this Law. <hi>But I ſay unto you;</hi> I, who clearly ſhew unto you that way wherein you muſt walk, before you can promiſe to your ſelves any hope of eternal life; I ſay unto you, not only, whoſoever ſhall kill his neighbour, but whoſoever out of malice or rancour,<note place="margin">V. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhall ſay unto his brother, Thou fool, ſhall be in danger of Hell fire.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">V. 27.</note> So likewiſe, not only he which commits Adultery in the outward act, is culpable by my Goſpel before God, but alſo he which looks upon a woman to luſt after her in his heart.<note place="margin">V. 33.</note> And ſo inſtead of Forſwearing and breaking of Oaths, and Vows, which <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law forbad; Chriſt condemns fruitleſs and unneceſſary,<note place="margin">V. 38.</note> though true, Oaths. Inſtead of the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64345:267"/>Law of Retaliation of injuries, Chriſt commands rather to ſuffer a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond injury, than to revenge the firſt.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. But in the laſt place, the laſt Example which our Saviour gives, may ſeem to deſtroy this collection which hath been drawn out of this Chapter: for, ſaith he Verſ. 43. <hi>You have heard,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">V. 43.</note> 
                     <hi>that it hath been ſaid of old, Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</hi> What! did <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law then permit a man to bear hatred and malice unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Did I ſay, permit them? Nay, it commanded them ſo perfectly to hate their enemies, to wit, the ſeven Nations who poſſeſſed that land, which was theirs by promiſe,<note place="margin">Exod. 34.2. Deut. 7.1. Exod. 27.19. Deut. 30.19.</note> mentioned <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.2. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.1. to which were added the <hi>Amalekites, Exod.</hi> 27.19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.19. That they were enjoyned to deſtroy them utterly, old and young, men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and children, even to the very cattel, without all pity and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Inſomuch, that <hi>Saul,</hi> for his unſeaſonable pity but of one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that a King of the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> and reſerving the beſt of the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel for ſacrifice to God, had the Kingdom utterly rent from him and his poſterity. Whereas, by our Saviour, in the words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Enmity is ſlain: No enemies now in Chriſtianity, but all neighbours, and friends, and brethren; nay more, If any one will needs be your enemy, love him notwithſtanding, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If he curſe you, bleſs him; If he hate you, do good unto him; If he uſe you deſpitefully, and perſecute you, pray for him.</hi> To conclude this argument from our Saviour's authority; Chriſt adds, as a Corollary to his diſcourſe, ſpeaking to his Diſciples and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, <hi>Except your righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">V. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>i.</hi> whereas they content themſelves with an outward car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal obedience to the Law, unleſs you, beſides this, add a ſpiritual ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the mind, <hi>ye ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> I deny not now, but that there may be a myſtical ſpiritual ſenſe even of this Law, and an application thereof almoſt as perfect, as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in the Goſpel, which thoſe who were guided extraordinarily by the Spirit of God, and with help of Tradition, might collect out of it; As the Prophet <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 19. where he ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.7.</note> 
                     <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoul; the Commandement of the Lord is pure, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning the eyes, &amp;c.</hi> And in this ſenſe, the ſucceeding Prophets en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to perſwade the people to apprehend it.

                  <p n="22">22. I would not now have you ſo conceive me, as if I would exclude the <hi>Jews</hi> of the Old-Teſtament from being partakers of the Promiſes of the Goſpel: No, God forbid: But, that which I have ſaid, is this, that they attain'd not unto them by performing <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, but by the very ſame means by which we hope to be partakers of them, namely, by performing the ſubſtance of thoſe duties which are clearly delivered unto us in the Goſpel, and may be found ſprinkled in ſeveral places, even in <hi>Moſes</hi> his writings, and no queſtion but were more fully and compleatly delivered unto them by Tradition from their Fathers.

It follows, <hi>And I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people, i. e.</hi> I will be their God after a more eſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then I was unto them in the Wilderneſs; I will not only be their King to govern them in peace and tranquillity, out of the danger and fear of their Enemies the Nations about them, and preſerve them ſafe in the promiſed Land; but I will keep them from the fury and malice of their ſpiritual Enemies that would ſeek to deſtroy their ſouls, and I will bring them to a Land infinitely exceeding theirs, and whereof the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was but a moſt unproportionable type and ſhadow, even mine own bleſſed and glorious Kingdom, reſerved in the higheſt Heavens, for them who ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely perform the conditions of my New Covenant. Thus farr as largely as ſo ſmall a meaſure of time would permit me, I have told you the difference betwixt the Covenant of Grace and <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, imply'd in theſe words of my Text, <hi>through the Spirit:</hi> I come now to my ſecond particular, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the diſtinction of the ſame Covenant of Grace from the Law of works, wherein I ſhall proceed by the ſame method, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſhewing you firſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely the nature of thoſe Laws, and then the ſeveral differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. The Law of Works is the ſame with that, to the obedience where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Adam</hi> was oblig'd in Paradiſe with this exception, that beſides the Moral natural Law written in his heart, (the ſubſtance whereof is to this day reſerved in the minds of all the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi>) <hi>Adam</hi> had a ſecond poſitive Law injoyn'd him by God, namely, the forbidding him to eat of the Tree of Good and Evil: which one Precept cannot properly be call'd a part of the Law of Works, or Nature, ſince the Action there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by forbidden was not of its own nature evil, but only made unlawful by vertue of God's prohibition: Excepting therefore this one particular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, the Law which was given to <hi>Adam,</hi> (call'd the Law of Works),
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64345:270"/>comprehended in it all kind of moral duties referr'd either to God, his Neighbour, or Himſelf, which have in them a natural eſſential goodneſs, or righteouſneſs; and, by conſequence, the prohibition, of all manner of actions, words, or thoughts, which are in themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Juſtice, and Reaſon. All theſe Precepts are generally ſuppos'd to be contained in the Ten Words written by Gods own finger in two Tables of Stone; though, with ſubmiſſion, I think, that thoſe two Tables contain only directly the moral duties of man to God and his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: for it will require much forcing and ſtraining to bring in the duties and ſins of a man againſt his own perſon within that compaſs, as Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Sobriety, and their oppoſites, Gluttony, Drunkenneſs, Self-inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

The Juſtification which was due to the performance of this Law by Juſtice, and as the wages thereof, that is, the condition wherein God oblig'd himſelf to ſuch as fulfill'd it, was the promiſes of this life, and that which is to come; Long, happy and peaceable days in this world, and in their due time a tranſlation to the joys and glory of heaven: This Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation did not comprehend Remiſſion of Sins, as ours does, for the Law excluded all hope of pardon after ſin, no promiſe made to repentance, repentance would do no good: The Court wherein they were to be judg'd was a Court of meer rigorous Juſtice, Juſtice rejoyc'd over and againſt Mercy, Grace, Loving-kindneſs, and all thoſe bleſſed and glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, whereby God for our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt his ſake is pleaſed and delighted to be known unto the world.</p>

29. The ſtate of mankind without Chriſt, being ſo deplored, ſo out of al hope, as I told you: Almighty God out of his infinite mercy and goodneſs, by his unſpeakable wiſdom found out an attonement, accepting of the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary exinanition and humiliation of his dearly beloved Son, who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf, to be made fleſh, to all our natural infirmities (ſin only excepted) and at laſt to dye that ignominious accurſed death of the Croſs for the Redemption of mankind; Who in his death made a Covenant with his Father, that thoſe, and only thoſe, who would be willing to ſubmit themſelves to the obedience of a new Law, which he would preſcribe unto mankind, ſhould for the merits of his obedience and death be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the ſight of God, have their ſins forgiven them, and be made heirs of everlaſting glory: Now, that Chriſt's death was in order of Nature, before the giving of the Goſpel, is (I think) evident by thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul.

                  </p>
                  <p n="31">31. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Propoſition, I am perſwaded, excludes none of theſe ſenſes; it is capeble of them all: But, before I ſhew you how they may conſiſt together, I will, in the firſt place, declare of what nature that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is, which God by vertue of his New Covenant requires at our hands before he will make good his promiſe unto us. Firſt, then, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires at our hands a ſincere Obedience unto the ſubſtance of all Moral duties of the Old Covenant, and that by the Goſpel: And this obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſo neceſſary, that it is impoſſible any man ſhould be ſaved without it. The preſſing of this Doctrine takes up by much the greateſt part of the Evangelical Writings. Now, that theſe Duties are not enforc'd upon us, as conditions of the Old Covenant of Works, is evident, becauſe, by Chriſt we are freed from the Obligation of the Old Covenant: God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids, that we ſhould have a thought of expecting the hope of righteouſneſs upon thoſe terms: For, that Covenant will not admit of any imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in our works, and then, in what a miſerable caſe are we! There is no hope for us, unleſs ſome courſe be taken, that not only our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but our ſins, and thoſe of a high nature, be paſs'd by, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd by Almighty God, as if He had loſt his eyes to ſee them, or his memory to remember them.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. The ſubſtance then of the Moral Law is enjoyn'd us by the New-Covenant, but with what difference I ſhall ſhew you preſently. And hereupon it is that our Saviour ſaith to the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who were willing to make any miſ-conſtruction of his Doctrine, <hi>Think you that I am come to deſtroy the Law?</hi> I, by all means, ſay we, God forbid elſe, for unleſs the old Law be deſtroy'd, we are undone; as long as that is alive, we are dead: If the Law of Works have its natural force ſtill, woe be to us. Therefore, that muſt not be Chriſt's meaning: His intent is, as if he ſhould ſay, Think you that I am come to deſtroy the righteouſneſs of the Law? to diſ-oblige men from the neceſſity of being good, holy, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous? No, by no means; <hi>I am not come to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfil it:</hi> The righteouſneſs of the Law, according to the ſubſtance thereof, ſhallbe as neceſſarily required by vertue of that New Covenant which I preach unto you, and to which I exhort you all to ſubmit your ſelves, as ever it was by the Old Covenant; only becauſe of your weakneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, I will abate the rigour of it: Thoſe who notwithſtanding my
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64345:271" rendition="simple:additions"/>offer of Grace and Pardon upon ſuch eaſie conditions as I preſcribe, will yet continue in an habitual ſtate of profaneneſs and irreligion ſhall be as culpable, nay, ten times more miſerable than if they never had heard of me, for their wilful neglecting ſo great ſalvation. <hi>It is eaſier for Heaven and Earth to paſs away, than for one tittle of the Law to fail:</hi> For God would be no looſer by the annihilation of the world, whereas if any part of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law ſhould expire, the very beams and rayes of Gods eſſential goodneſs ſhould be darkened and deſtroy'd.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. In like manner ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 11. <hi>ult.<note place="margin">Rom. 3. <hi>ult.</hi>
                        </note> Do we make void the Law through Faith? God forbid: yea, we eſtabliſh the Law.</hi> Now, if a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Covenant eſtabliſheth any part of a Precedent, eſpecially, if there be any alteration made in the conditions eſtabliſhed, all obligation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is taken from the Old Covenant, and thoſe conditions are in force only by vertue of the New. When the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquerour was pleas'd to eſtabliſh and confirm to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſome of the ancient <hi>Saxons</hi> Laws, Are thoſe Laws then become in force as they are <hi>Saxon?</hi> No, for the Authority of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> the Authors of thoſe Laws, is ſuppoſed to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, and therefore no power remains in them to look to the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them: But by the confirmation of the <hi>Norman</hi> they are become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Norman</hi> Laws, and are now in force, not becauſe they were firſt made by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> but only by vertue of the ſucceeding power of the <hi>Norman</hi> line. So likewiſe, when the Goſpel enjoyns the ſubſtance of the ſame duties which the old Covenant of Works required; Are we Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans enforc'd to the obedience of them, becauſe they are duties of the Law? By no means! But only becauſe our Saviour and only Law-maker Jeſus Chriſt commands the ſame in the Law of Faith.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. Thus far the New Covenant is in ſome terms of agreement with the Old, inaſmuch as the ſame Moral duties are enjoyn'd in them both, as parts of the conditions of both. But the difference herein is, That the Law commands a preciſe exact fulfilling of theſe Precepts, (as I told you before) which the Goſpel deſcending to our infirmities, remits and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifies much: For in the Goſpel, he is accounted to fulfil the moral Precepts, that obeys them according to that meaſure of Grace which God is pleas'd to allow him; that obeys God, though not with a perfect, yet with a ſincere upright heart; that when he is overcome with a temptation to ſin, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues not in it, but recovers himſelf to his former righteouſneſs by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and new Obedience: Thus much then for the moral Precepts and with what difference they are commanded in the Old and New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. In the ſecond place, there is another part of Evangelical Obedience, which is purely Evangelical, and which has no commerce nor reference at all to the Law, and that is the Grace of Repentance: For ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 17 30.</note> Act. 17.30. <hi>But now (that is by the Goſpel) God commands all men every where to repent.</hi> Now Repentance implies a ſerious conſideration and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of that miſerable eſtate whereunto our ſins have brought us, and hereupon an hearty unfeigned ſorrow for them, a perfect hatred and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of them, inferring a full peremptory reſolution to break them off, and interrupt the courſe of them by new obedience. This, I ſay, is an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience purely Evangelical, The Law of Works did not at all meddle with it, neither indeed could it: The Law condemns a man aſſoon as ever he
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:64345:272" rendition="simple:additions"/>is guilty of the breach thereof, and makes no promiſe at all of Remiſſion of ſins upon Repentance; but rather quite excludes it. Yet from the grace of Repentance, we may gather a forcible argument to make good that which before we ſpoke concerning the Renewing of the Moral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts in the New Covenant. For no reaſonable man can deny, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is abſolutely neceſſary before a man can be Juſtified. Now what is that for which (for example) a new converted Heathen repents, but the breach of the Moral Law? therefore by this neceſſity of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, he acknowledgeth, (and ſo do we) that by ſuch ſins, he was exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from all hope of being Juſtified. Now it were abſurd, for a man to ſay that any thing excludes a man from being capable of receiving the promiſes of a Covenant, but only the breaking of the conditions thereof.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. The third part of Evangelical Righteouſneſs is, <hi>Faith,</hi> not Moral, but Chriſtian; which is, A relying upon Chriſt, as the only meritorious cauſe of whatſoever benefit we obtain by the new Covenant; It being for his ſake, both that God beſtowes upon us grace, whereby we are ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to perform his will; and after we have done our duty, that he will freely, and not as wages, beſtow upon us the reward thereof. There is another virtue Evangelical, which is Hope, but of that I muſt ſpeak in my laſt point. And thus I have gone through the Conditions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired on mans part in the New Covenant, all which I ſuppoſe are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in this word <hi>Faith:</hi> which being taken in ſo general a ſenſe, may, I conceive, be thus not improperly defined, <hi>viz.</hi> To be a receiving and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of the Promiſes made unto us in Chriſt, upon the terms and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions propoſed in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. Now follow the conditions on Gods part, comprehended in theſe words: The hope of Righteouſneſs, which are equivalent to the term of Juſtification: the nature whereof, I ſhall now endeavour to diſcover. Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, I ſuppoſe, imports the whole Treaſure of bleſſings and favours, which God, who is rich in mercy, will freely beſtow on thoſe whom he accepts as Righteous for his beloved Son our bleſſed Saviour Jeſus Chriſt his ſake; which are firſt, Remiſſion of ſins, and an intereſt unto the Joyes of heaven in this life, and a full conſummation both of Grace and Glory in the life to come. Some, I know, think that S. <hi>Paul</hi> when he diſcourſes of Juſtification, thereby intends only Remiſſion of ſins: And the ground of this opinion is taken from S. <hi>Paul</hi> quoting thoſe words of <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4.6, 7, 8.</note> when he ſtates the Doctrine of Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 7, 8. where he ſaith that <hi>David deſcribeth the bleſſedneſs of the man unto whom God imputeth Righteouſneſs without works, ſaying, Bleſſed are they whoſe unrighteouſneſs is forgiven, and whoſe ſins are covered; Bleſſed is the man unto whom the Lord will not impute ſin.</hi> But if this Argument out of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> be of ſufficient force for their ſenſe of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; Then certainly an Argument from as expreſs words in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> will be as concluding for mine (in which Epiſtle he alſo purpoſely ſtates the ſame queſtions).<note place="margin">Gal. 3.11.</note> The words are <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11. <hi>That no man is juſtified by the Law in the ſight of God, it is evident, for the Just ſhall live by faith.</hi> Now, <hi>to live,</hi> I hope, does not ſignifie, to have ones ſins forgiven him, but to be Saved: Therefore, unleſs S. <hi>Paul</hi> include a right unto Salvation within the compaſs of Juſtification, that Text might have been ſpared, as nothing at all ſerving for his purpoſe.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:64345:272" rendition="simple:additions"/>Beſides, Is not Salvation, as free, as gracious, as undeſerved an act of God, as Remiſſion of ſins? Is it not as much for Chriſts ſake that we are ſaved, as that our ſins are forgiven us? Thus much for what I ſuppoſe is meant by Juſtification. I will now as briefly and as perſpicuouſly as I can (without uſing Allegories and Metaphorical expreſſions, with which this point is ordinarily much obſcured) ſhew you the combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe two words, in what ſenſe I ſuppoſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> may uſe this propoſition; <hi>We are Juſtified by Faith, without the Works of the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="38">38. In the firſt place therefore I will lay down this Concluſion as an infallible ſafe foundation, That if we have reſpect to the proper merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe of our Juſtification, we muſt not take Faith, in that Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for any virtue or Grace inherent in us, but only for the proper and principal object thereof. Jeſus Chriſt and his Merits. And the meaning of that Propoſition muſt be, that we are not juſtified for the merits of any Righteouſneſs in our ſelves, whether Legal or Evangelical, but only for the Obedience and Death of our Bleſſed Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. Though this be moſt true, yet I ſuppoſe that S. <hi>Paul</hi> in that propoſition, had not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Meritorious Cauſe of our Juſtification; but to that Formal Condition required in us before we be Juſtified: as I think may appear by that which follows.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. I told you even now, that I would in this point purpoſely abſtain from uſing Metaphors, and Figurative Alluſions; and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, I ſuppoſe, and not without reaſonable grounds, that the ſtating of this point of Juſtification by Metaphors, has made this Doctrine, which is ſet down with greater light and perſpicuity in holy Scripture, than al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt any other, to be a Doctrine of the moſt Scholaſtical ſubtilty, the fulleſt of ſhadows and clouds of all the reſt. For example: In that faſhion and dreſs of Divinity, as it is now worn, ſlic'd and mangled into Theſes and Diſtinctions, we find this point of our Juſtification thus expreſs'd: That Faith is therefore ſaid to Juſtifie us, becauſe it is that which makes Chriſts righteouſneſs ours: it is as it were an inſtrument or hand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we receive, lay hold on, and apply Chriſt unto our ſelves. Here's nought but flowers of Rhetorick, Figures, and Metaphors; which though they are capable of a good ſenſe, yet are very improper to ſtate a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie withall.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. But let us examine them a little: We muſt not ſay, they conceive of Faith, as if it were a Vertue or Grace, or any part of Righteouſneſs inherent in us: For Faith as a Grace has no influence at all into our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Mark the Coherence of theſe things: Faith is conſidered as an hand or an inſtrument in our Juſtification, and yet, for all it is a Hand, it is nothing in, or of, us; for it ſeems, Hands are not parts of mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Again, Faith puts on Chriſt, receives him, layes hold upon him, makes his righteouſneſs ours, and yet it does nothing for all that. Beſides, How can Faith be properly call'd an inſtrument of Juſtification? An In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument is that which the principal Cauſe the Efficient makes uſe of in his operation. Now Juſtification in this ſenſe, is an immanent internal action of God, in which there is no co-operation of any other agent, nor any real alteration wrought in man, the object thereof. Does God then uſe Faith as an inſtrument, in producing the Act of Juſtification? No, but
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:64345:273" rendition="simple:additions"/>it is <hi>Inſtrumentum Paſsivum,</hi> ſaith one; That is a thing never heard of in nature before, and the meaning is ſure, Faith, certainly, is ſomething, but what a kind of thing, we know not. By theſe means it comes to paſs, that the Doctrine of our Juſtification, as ſome men have handled it, is become as deep, as unſearchable a myſtery, as that of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. Without queſtion, there is nothing can be more evident to a man, that ſhall unpartially conſider S. <hi>Paul's</hi> method in his diſcourſe of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, then that by Faith he intends ſome operative working grace in us: For inſtance, The Apoſtle proves that we Chriſtians are to ſeek for Juſtification the ſame way that <hi>Abraham</hi> attained unto it, namely by Faith; for, ſaith the Scripture in his quotation, <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteouſneſs.</hi> What was that which was accounted to him? His believing; That is, ſay ſome, Chriſt who was the object of his Belief: This is a forc'd interpretation certainly, and which a Jew would never have been perſwaded to. But that Chriſt was not at all intended in that place, it is evident; for <hi>Abraham</hi>'s belief there, had reſpect to Gods promiſe made to him of giving him a Son in his old age, and by that Son, a Seed as innumerable as the ſtars in heaven, as appears <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.4, 5, 6. whereas the Promiſe of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Gen. 15.4, 5, 6. Gen. 18.18.</note> follows three Chapters after, to wit, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.18. Again, the Apoſtle in many places, uſeth theſe words, <hi>We are Juſtified by Faith in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> which ſpeeches of his, will admit of no tolerable ſenſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by Faith he intends ſome work or obedience perform'd by us. This therefore being taken for granted, that by Faith, is meant ſome condition required at our hands, (and yet my former concluſion of our Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only for the merits of Chriſt remaining firm): we will in the next place conſider what kind of obedience that of Faith is, and in what ſenſe it may be ſaid to juſtifie us.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. What ſatisfaction I conceive may be given to this Quaery, I will ſet down in this Aſſertion:<note place="margin">Aſſertion.</note> That ſince Juſtification, even as it includes Remiſſion of ſins, is that Promiſe, to perform which unto us, God has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd himſelf in the New Covenant; it muſt neceſſarily preſuppoſe in the perſon to be ſo juſtified, ſuch an obedience as the Goſpel requires; namely firſt, Repentance from dead works, a converſion to a new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of thoſe holy Moral Commands which are ratifi'd in the Goſpel, and a relying upon Chriſt as the only meritorious cauſe of our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Salvation, by a particular Evangelical Faith. All this, I ſay, is pre-required in the perſon who is made capable of Juſtification, either in the exerciſe, or at leaſt <hi>in praeparatione cordis,</hi> in a full reſolution of the heart, and entire diſpoſition of the mind: So that, though God be the ſole proper Efficient Cauſe; and Chriſt, as Mediatour, the ſole proper Meritorious Cauſe of our Juſtification: yet theſe inherent diſpoſitions, are exacted on our part, as <hi>cauſae ſine quibus non,</hi> as neceſſary conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be found in us, before God will perform this great work, freely, and graciouſly towards us, and only for the Merits of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. This Aſſertion may,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>1</label> I ſuppoſe, be demonſtrated firſt from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Covenant: For, unleſs there be pre-required conditions on man's part to be perform'd, before God will proportion his reward; the very nature of a Covenant is deſtroy'd. And it will not boot to anſwer,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:64345:273" rendition="simple:additions"/>that though there be no qualifications required in a man, before he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Remiſſion of ſins, yet they are to be found in us before we be made capable of Salvation. For, as I have ſhew'd before,<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>1</label> Salvation is as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly a gracious Act of Mercy, as free and undeſerved a gift, as truly beſtowed on us only for the Merits of Chriſt, as Remiſſion of ſins; and therefore may as well conſiſt without any change in us as the former.

                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. <hi>By Grace are ye ſaved through Faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God: not of Works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> Put I hope no man will be ſo unchriſtian-like, as to exclude the neceſſity of our good works to ſalvation, for all this ſaying of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> therefore, they may as well be pre-required to Remiſſion of ſins, notwithſtanding the former place.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>4</label> I might add a fourth Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to prove my former Aſſertion, which is the clearneſs and evidence of agreement and reconciliation between S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and S. <hi>James</hi> in this point upon theſe grounds, without any new invented Juſtification before men, which is a conceit taken up by ſome men, only to ſhift off an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary's argument, which otherwiſe would preſs them too hard, they think: for, S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Faith, taken for the obedience of the Goſpel, would
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:64345:274" rendition="simple:additions"/>eaſily accord with S. <hi>James</hi> his <hi>holy and undefiled Religion before God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam. 1.27.</note> or works which is all one; And S. <hi>James</hi> would be S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitour without any injury or detraction at all from the merits of Chriſt, or Gods free and undeſerved mercy to us in him. But I muſt haſten.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. The full meaning, then, of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Propoſition, <hi>We are juſtified by Faith, and not by the works of the Law:</hi> and by conſequence, the ſtate of the whole controverſie of Juſtification, in brief, may be this; That if we conſider the efficient cauſe of our Juſtification, it is only God which Juſtifies: if that for which we are juſtified, that is, the meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious cauſe thereof, it is not for any thing in our ſelves, but only for the obedience and ſatisfaction of our Bleſſed Saviour, that God will Juſtifie us: But if we have reſpect to what kind of Conditions are to be found in us, before Chriſt will ſuffer us to be made partakers of the benefit of his Merits, then we muſt ſay, that we are not juſtified by ſuch a Righteouſneſs, ſo perfect, abſolute, and complete, as the Law of Works does require; but by the righteouſneſs of the Goſpel, by a Righteouſneſs proportionable to that Grace which God is pleaſed to beſtow on us; not by the perfection, but ſincerity of our obedience to the New Covenant. And the Apoſtle's main argument will ſerve to prove this to any underſtanding, moſt undeniably. S. <hi>Paul</hi> has demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, that if we conſider the rigour of the Law, all men, both Jews and Gentiles are concluded under ſin, and moſt neceſſarily obnoxious to Gods wrath. Which Reaſon of his, would not be at all prevailing, unleſs by works of the Law, he intended only ſuch a perfect obedience as the Law requires; which by reaſon of mans weakneſs, is become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible unto him. For it might eaſily be reply'd upon him thus: We confeſs, no man can fulfil the Law; but the conditions of the Goſpel are not only poſſible, but, by the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, eaſie to be performed; ſo that though, for this reaſon, the former Righteouſneſs be excluded from our Juſtification, not only <hi>quoad meritum,</hi> but alſo, <hi>quoad praeſentiam;</hi> yet the later Evangelical Righteouſneſs is excluded from our Juſtification, only <hi>quoad Meritum.</hi>

But I perceive an Objection ready to aſſault me; and I will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially aſſiſt the force and ſtrength thereof againſt my ſelf, with all the advantage I can. It is to this purpoſe: When men are diſputing in the Schools, or diſcourſing in the Pulpit, they may ſtate this queſtion as they pleaſe: But the fitteſt time to decide this point, is, when, in a ſerious contemplation, we preſent before our eyes Almighty God, the righteous impartial Judge of heaven and earth, ſitting in his Throne, ready to execute Judgement, and our ſelves arraigned at the Barr before him, expecting a final irreverſible ſentence. In theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, I would fain ſee the ſtouteſt-hearted man alive, that ſhould dare to ſay unto Almighty God, Thou haſt given me a Law, which my conſcience witneſſeth unto me, that I have perform'd. Therefore I now challenge thee upon thy Truth and Faithfulneſs, that thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thy conditions alſo with me, and give me Remiſſion of my former ſins, as a Reward of my obedience.</p>

48. For anſwer to this Objection: This is confeſſed by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of all Religions, that a Profane perſon, or an Hypocrite dying in ſuch an eſtate, ſhall neither in the laſt day be acquitted of his ſins, nor ſaved: Therefore unleſs a mans heart can witneſs unto him, that he hath unfeignedly kept Gods Commandements, <hi>God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. c. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>who is greater than his heart, and knoweth all things,</hi> will aſſuredly condemn him: But then we muſt know, that it is not a Chriſtians plea, to relie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own, though ſincere unhypocritical Righteouſneſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to challenge heaven. But as our Saviour adviſeth us,<note place="margin">Luke 17.10.</note> 
                     <hi>We when we have done all we can, muſt ſay, We are unprofitable ſervants:</hi> And not ſay ſo in a complement only, but in the truth and ſincerity of our hearts. It is the perfection of Evangelical Righteouſneſs, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny our own righteouſneſs, to diſclaim all meritorious efficacy thereof, either in Remiſſion of ſins, or Salvation. Therefore, he that after he hath perform'd Gods Commandements, ſhall think to challenge the reward as of debt, or as promiſed only to his own holineſs, wants the proper peculiar righteouſneſs of a Chriſtian: He muſt ſay in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Job</hi>'s words, <hi>Though I were righteous, yet would I not anſwer God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 9.15.</note> 
                     <hi>but I will make ſupplication to my Judge:</hi> I would ſay unto him, Lord look not upon that holineſs which is in me, which yet is not mine neither, for thou wrought'ſt it in me; But look on him in whom only thou art well pleaſed; Accept of me in him, and for his ſake only, who hath fulfill'd all righteouſneſs for me, who through the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit, hath offered himſelf without ſpot unto thee, being made ſin and a curſe for me, that I might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him. To him only be glory for ever and ever. The ſum of all which I have ſaid, is contain'd <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11,-14. <hi>The Grace of God which bringeth,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo I come to the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> General, namely, the Promiſe which God will make good unto us who ſincerely obey him, contain'd in theſe words, <hi>We wait for the Hope,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. Which General I divided into two Particulars:
<list>
                        <item>1. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the reward promiſed, which I told you was, Juſtification con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Remiſſion of Sins, and everlaſting Life.</item>
                        <item>2. The intereſt, which, during this life, we ordinarily have in that reward, namely Hope, expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>We wait for the Hope of Righteouſneſs:</hi> that is, by hope we expect the reward of righteouſneſs.</item>
                     </list> I cannot now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large my ſelf in the former particular, ſomething I have already been forc'd to ſay of it, which muſt ſuffice: I will in few words conſider the ſecond Particular, namely the intereſt which we have in the Promiſes, which is Hope: <hi>We wait for,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. I know nothing more effectual to perſwade me to ſearch for and embrace Divine Truth with ſingleneſs of heart and without reſpect of perſons, then to conſider, that there are no opinions ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, ſo directly contradictory to one another, but the Spirit of contradiction and partiality will make a man eaſily to ſwallow and digeſt them. As for example, whereas the Papiſts moſt preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly maintain, that it is in a mans power, by the ordinary aſſiſtance of Grace, ſo exactly to perform all Gods Commandements, that he ſhall have no need to ſay, <hi>Lord forgive us our treſpaſſes;</hi> Some of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64345:275" rendition="simple:additions"/>their adverſaries ſtrive ſo much to avoid this Aſſertion on the contrary extream, that they will not allow, even the beſt and moſt holy Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the moſt Regenerate man, to be ſuch as God requires at our hands; they will not only have them to be imperfect, but ſinful, I, if ſtrictly examined, ſins. And yet for all this, thoſe who put it in a mans power to fulfil all Gods Commandements, will not ſuffer any man to have any certainty of their Salvation: On the contrary, the others, though they make a mans beſt actions to be ſins, yet require at his hands an infallible divine Faith of his Salvation, not only as an attendant, but as the very nature and eſſence of that Faith, whereby he ſhall be Juſtified.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. It may be poſſible, that one of theſe parties might light upon the truth, if either of them would be willing to change one of his opinions with his adverſary: but, as they have been pleaſed to yoke ſuch jarring poſitions together, I am confidently perſwaded, that both of them have miſſ'd of the truth, and left it in the middle to any third perſon that will be willing to ſtand neuter in a mean betwixt them both. I will not now examine how farr each ſide have out-run the truth contrary waies: only as I am required by that part of my Text which remains, I will lay down two Aſſertions participating, in ſome meaſure,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of both opinions;
<list>
                        <item>The firſt whereof is this (which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready touch'd) That no man can juſtly and reaſonably expect or hope for the reward of righteouſneſs, but he whoſe heart and conſcience can unfeignedly witneſs unto him, that he hath, though not exactly, yet ſincerely, and without Hypocriſie, perform'd the conditions of the New Covenant.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                        </item>
                        <item>The ſecond, That the intereſt which ſuch a perſon ordinarily hath in the Promiſes, is only Hope.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p n="52">52. Now concerning the 1. Aſſertion,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aſſert.</hi> 1.</note> namely, That no man can juſtly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I would not now be miſtaken, as if I ſaid, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man can hope for ſalvation, he muſt perform Gods Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements exactly, but only according to the equity of the Goſpel; according to that famous ſaying of S. <hi>Auguſtine, Retractat. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 19. <hi>Omnia mandata facta deputantur, quando quicquid non fit ignoſcitur.</hi> Now, that a man may keep Gods Commandements, as far as the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Goſpel expects from him, may, I think, be thus demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: There is no man that hears me this day, I am perſwaded, but he does often ſeriouſly deſire of God, that he would give him the Grace to do his will: Now, all prayer, if it be right, is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd in Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> with a full perſwaſion, not only that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and warrantable, for him to deſire that which he prays for, but alſo with as full a perſwaſion, that Almighty God is not only able, but ready and willing alſo to grant him his petitions; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it is not only a vain, but a ſinful prayer; it is a tempting of God, as if he ſhould deſire him to do that, which he knows is impoſſible. Beſides, can we think that God would command us (and withall add a promiſe of hearing and granting our petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) would he, I ſay, command us to pray for that which we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of before hand, cannot, and muſt not, be granted? Therefore certainly, ſome Chriſtians have been heard in theſe petitions; ſome
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:64345:275" rendition="simple:additions"/>men have been found, who have fulfilled the righteouſneſs of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
                  <p n="53">53. Now till thou haſt done this, which thou ſeeſt by the aſſiſtance of God's Spirit, (which will never be wanting to them which deſire it) it is poſſible for thee to do; nay, I will add further, is eaſie for thee to do: Doth not Chriſt ſay as much? <hi>My yoak is eaſie, and my burthen is light.</hi> I ſay, till thou haſt done this, thou canſt have no reaſon in the world to hope for Gods mercy. For tell me! why doſt thou hope, thou that continueſt ſtill in an unrepentant eſtate, in an habitual oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to God's holy Commandements? Art thou reſolved to hope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt a mind to it, upon no ground? when thou oughteſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fear, almoſt to deſpair? Or rather, canſt thou perſwade thy ſelf in earneſt, that this is indeed a hope? Is it not a fancy of thine own brain, or rather a Temptation of the Devil? <hi>Hope,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 5.5.</note> 
                     <hi>which is hope indeed,</hi> which is not a fancy and Chimera, <hi>makes not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul:</hi> A man may with confidence, without confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of face, profeſs and maintain it. But ſuch a hope as this is, which is not a hope in earneſt, how will it diſgrace a man, and put him out of countenance, when God ſhall ask him why he did offer to hope?</p>
                  <p n="54">54. Let thy conſcience now anſwer me, whoſoever thou art, in ſuch a ſtate. Thou that knoweſt how often God hath ſaid, nay, ſworn in his wrath, that none of thoſe which continue diſobedient, ſhall enter into his reſt! That none ſhall be partakers of the ſecond Reſurrection unto Glory, but thoſe that have been partakers of the firſt unto Grace! Canſt thou for all this, imagine, that God has ſuch a peculiar particular affection and reſpect to thee, who art yet a ſlave of the Devils; that he will be content to ſtrain his Truth and veracity, to break his Oath for thy company? Shall the whole Scripture, which promiſes glory to none but thoſe who perform the conditions preſcribed, for thy ſake be turned into a Romance, into a melancholy Tale to fright chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren withall? No, no, Aſſure thy ſelf, it is not a conceit of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which will ſave thee: thou muſt work, and work hard, in fear and trembling, before God will raiſe in thee the good Spirit of Chriſtian Hope.</p>
                  <p n="55">55. For to ſay the truth of all Divine Graces, Hope is incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the hardeſt to attain unto: And the reaſon is evident, becauſe it pre-ſuppoſes the poſſeſſion of all other Graces before it. And yet for all this, nothing counted ſo eaſie, now a daies, as Hope, though men both are and reſolve to be never ſo wicked: Nay, and it is well if Hope will ſerve their turn, they muſt have an infallible aſſurance, a Divine Faith of everlaſting glory; And no manner of ſins, though never ſo heinous, never ſo oft committed, ſhall be able to weaken this their aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that they are reſolved of. This they think is a ſpell ſtrong enough for the Devil in all aſſails; when God knows, the Devil is more joy'd and comforted, to ſee them ſo vainly delude themſelves, then they themſelves poſsibly can be. This for my firſt Aſſertion; now follows the ſecond.</p>
                  <p n="56">
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:64345:276" rendition="simple:additions"/>
56. When I ſay,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aſſert.</hi> 2.</note> that the Intereſt which a Chriſtian ordinarily has in the Promiſes of God, is <hi>Hope;</hi> I mean, it is not abſolute and irreſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, but depending upon conditions, namely, Grace, and perſeverance therein. And this I took for granted, for I never heard of any yet, that denyed perſeverance to be neceſſary to ſalvation. If then his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt be by Hope, then it is not yet by Faith, properly ſo called; For it is not poſsible, that the ſame object (conſidered with the ſame circumſtances at the ſame time) ſhould be the object both of Faith and Hope. For example: I believe by a Divine Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Faith grounded upon God's Word, that there ſhall be a Reſurrection of the Fleſh, even of this fleſh of mine; And I believe it firmly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath ſaid that he will bring it to paſs; neither is there any condition of mine pre-required to the performance of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God; for howſoever I behave my ſelf here in this world, whether well or ill, it matters not, my behaviour cannot make God alter his reſolution. Now, if I aſſuredly believe this, it would be improper and abſurd, for me to ſay, I hope there will be a Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of my body; for when I ſay, I hope any thing, I imply a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, in nature, that ſuch a thing may not be, which in this caſe I cannot do without infidelity.</p>
                  <p n="57">57. But, on the other ſide, I hope that God will raiſe this fleſh of mine unto Glory, and I hope this upon ſafe grounds: Therefore, if it be true that I hope it, I cannot properly be ſaid to believe it, becauſe my ſalvation yet depends upon conditions; namely, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. Therefore let me propoſe this one queſtion to any mans conſcience: Haſt thou ſuch an aſſurance of ſalvation given thee of God, that Hope is quite evacuated in thee: Is there no ſuch vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue left in thee as Hope? Surely God hath dealt extraordinarily mercifully with thee; Thou art many degrees gone beyond the ſtate of thoſe believers which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, and includes himſelf in the number, when he ſaith, <hi>We live by Hope:</hi> For thou doeſt not live by Hope, thou art exalted above it. Notwithſtanding, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, conſider well upon the matter, (for it concerns you very much) be not too haſty to credit fancies, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of aſſurance or impeccability ſhall be ſuggeſted to your minds. There may be great danger of a confidence ungrounded; a confidence only taken upon truſt, from other mens words or opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. Do I go about (now think you) to bereave you, or couſen you of any ſpiritual comfort in this life? Do I envy any of you your aſſurance? Alas, why ſhould I deal ſo with you? for I was never injur'd by you; or, if I were, ſurely, of all places, I would not make choice of this to execute my Revenge in. Or if I thought that ſuch an aſſurance were ordinarily to be had, at leaſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to the making up of a Juſtifying Faith, (and have you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard it ſaid ſo?) would I not (think you) ſtrive and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to obtain it at any rate, even with the loſs of all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comforts? Yes certainly, I would count them all but as droſs and dung in compariſon of it: But I confeſs unto you I am yet
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:64345:276" rendition="simple:additions"/>contented with enjoying Heaven by Hope: And I bleſs Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, that he has dealt ſo graciouſly with me, that I ſhould dare to hope for it, and not be ſhamed and confounded by my hope. And if there be any amongſt you, that will vouchſafe to content himſelf with ſuch a neglected degree of comfort, with only hope, and no more, I will not enter into compariſon with thoſe that are perfect; but I dare promiſe him, that all thoſe troubleſome pleaſures, which do ſo raviſh the men of this world, ſhall be as nothing; yea, as afflictions and torments, in compariſon of thoſe ſpiritual heavenly Joyes, which Hope, well and legally atchieved, will be able to afford us: No dangers will there be of terrours or jealouſies, as if God would happen to grow weary, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent himſelf of any grace or bleſſing which he hath beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</p>
                  <p n="59">59. For, tell me; Do you think that <hi>Adam,</hi> while he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Innocency, had any grudgings of ſuſpicions or fears? Was he not, during that time, in as great a quiet and ſerenity of mind, as any of us dare hope for? And yet the moſt that he could do then, was to hope that he might continue in that ſtate even to the end: The event ſhews, he could not have an infallible Faith of his perſeverance. If then ſuch a contented ſetled mind could accompany <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, even when he knew it was in his power, with but reaching out his hand, and taſting an Apple; yea, with a ſudden wicked word, or an unſanctified thought, utterly, and irrecoverably to degrade himſelf from that happy eſtate; ſurely, we Chriſtians have much more reaſon to rejoyce in our hope, ſince we know aſſuredly, that as God has been ſo gracious to begin this good work in us, ſo he will not be wanting to perfect it even to the end, if we will but perform our parts, which he has already given us more then ſufficient grace to do, and will never fail to ſupply us with more, for the asking: nay, more, which are ſurer grounds to build upon than ever <hi>Adam</hi> had; ſince we know, that not one, nor ten, nor a hundred ſins, ſhall be able ſo irreparably to caſt us out of God's favour, but that he will be willing upon our Repentance, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially calling to mind his old mercies, to reſtore us again to our loſt happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="60">60. Neither are we utterly excluded from all aſſurance; for there is a <gap reason="foreign">

And part of our Hope reſpects this chain; for God has promis'd his willingneſs and readineſs to ſtrengthen it every day more and more, till our ſtate ſhall be ſo chang'd, that there ſhall be no ſuch things as Tempeſts known, no toſſings of waves, no tumults of winds, nor fear of leaking or decay in the Veſſel, but all calmneſs and ſecurity.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:64345:278"/>and ſincerity of our hearts. Now for warrant to this kind of collection, inſtead of ſeveral examples in Holy Scripture, I will only make uſe of one taken out of (I think) this our Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.5.</note> where he ſaith, <hi>Let your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation be without covetouſneſs, and be content with ſuch things as you have; For God hath ſaid, I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> Which words by him quoted, as the margins of our Bibles will direct us, are to be found <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.5.

                  <p n="3">3. Upon which grounds I may as reaſonably direct the words of this verſe, out of which my Text is taken, to you that now hear me, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle does to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> And ſay, <hi>There hath no temptation taken you, but ſuch as is common to man:</hi> For certainly, we will not imagine, that the Church or City of <hi>Corinth</hi> had any ſuch extraordinary Immunity or Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter granted them, whereby they ſhould be exempted from the danger of Temptations above all the Chriſtian world beſides. Therefore let your memories recollect and examin the time paſt of your lives, and tell me, Did there ever any Temptation take hold of you, or aſſault you ſo powerful and irreſiſtable, that there was no way left for you but to be overcome by it? (Take Temptation now in what ſenſe you pleaſe, either for a misfortune and Affliction, or elſe for a Suggeſtion to ſin.) Was there ever any cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, any loſs, any pain, any ſickneſs, ſo violent and impetuous, but that ſtill you might perceive your ſelves notwithſtanding (though perhaps in your outward man unequally match't by it) yet in your ſpirits and minds ſtrong enough to conquer the malice thereof, and to convert it into whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Phyſick? Again, Was there ever any ſinful Temptation ſo ſtrongly urg'd upon you, but that you might by the aſſiſtance of that Grace which God had already given you, or at the leaſt, for the asking, would have ſuper-added, you might eaſily have dull'd and diverted the force thereof? Did not your Conſciences, even after you were overcome by ſuch a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, tell you, that it was meer voluntary cowardize in you, to ſuffer your ſelves to be overcome by it, that you willingly ſurrendred and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd thoſe forces which already God had given you?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Now, though I am perſwaded this be ſo evidently true, that there is ſcarce any one here but his Conſcience will aſſure him as much; Yet, for all this, we muſt not begin hereupon to fancy in our minds any extraordinary worth or dignity in our ſelves, as though by our own power or holineſs we could work ſuch wonders. No alas, nothing leſs: For take away the aſſiſtance and guard of our Auxiliary Forces, God's free and undeſerved Graces within us, and his Divine aſſiſtance, together with the Guard of his bleſſed Angels without us, and there is no Temptation ſo weak and deſpicable, which we ſhould not ſuddenly yield unto; Nay, we ſhould need no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Tempters to help us to ſin, our own wicked hearts would ſave the Devil that labour; For nothing is there ſo vile and abominable, whereunto without God's reſtraining Grace we ſhould not readily and impetuouſly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten unto.</p>

5. Therefore let us neither defraud God nor our ſelves of their dues: But as we have ſpoken of the time paſt, ſo likewiſe of that which follows, If hereafter we ſhall overcome any temptation (as certainly, by Gods help, if we have but a mind to it, we may) Let us bleſs Almighty God for aſſiſting us ſo farr, let us give the glory and Trophies of the conqueſt to him: But on the contrary ſide, if we ſhall neglect to make uſe and advantage of thoſe many helps againſt ſin, which Almighty God is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſupply unto us: If notwithſtanding thoſe many Promiſes of aſſiſtance ſo frequently ſet down in Holy Scripture; If notwithſtanding thoſe many ſecret whiſperings and inſpirations of his Holy Spirit in our ſouls: If not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding God's Voyce, which (as every day's experience can witneſs unto us) continually calls upon us, ſaying, <hi>This is the right way, walk in it, and ye ſhall find reſt to your ſouls;</hi> we will yet continue to extinguiſh thoſe good motions, to deafen and drown God's voyce, and be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to hearken unto, and obey our own filthy luſts and vile affections: Let us lay the fault where it is due, even upon our own deceitful wicked Hearts; or otherwiſe, the time will come when in Hell we ſhall be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently convinc'd thereof, when the worm of Conſcience which never dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſhall continually torment and gnaw us. Let God be true and faithful in his Promiſes, and every man a Lyar. For, as hitherto God has been ſo merciful to you to preſerve you, that no temptation ſhould take you, but ſuch as is common to man; ſo likewiſe for the time following, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps greater tryals may befal you, than hitherto you have had experience of, yet of this you may be confident, that howſoever they may ſeem grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous; yet the ſame God continues faithful and righteous to fulfil his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, <hi>He will never ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able.</hi>

If good; and aſſay, whether that good which ſeems to be in a ſubject be true and firmly grounded, or no: So God may be ſaid to tempt, as he did <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. And this he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms not to ſatisfie his curioſity, but meerly out of a good inclination to the party; both thereby to confirm his graces in him, and to reward them with a greater meaſure of Glory. If evil; Temptation is an aſſay, whether that good which ſeems to be in a man, may not by ſome means or other be extinguiſh'd, and ſo the perſon deſtroyed, ſo the Devil is moſt properly called the Tempter: And of this nature are the Temptations of my Text: Now theſe we find in Holy Scripture to be twofold:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For either they are apt to draw us from good by way of Diſcouragement; ſo all manner of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, misfortunes, perſecutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are called Temptations, becauſe by theſe a man is inclinable to be frighted from, or at laſt diſcountenanced in a holy converſation:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Or elſe they allure us by way of invitation or ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to evil; ſo wicked pleaſing ſuggeſtions are ſaid to be Temptations, becauſe theſe are fit to palliate the unlovelineſs and deformity of ſin, and thereby to make it deſirable unto us. It would be but loſs of time to heap together Examples of holy Scripture to make good this diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſince it is an Argument which you daily meet withal diſcours'd of in Sermons.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But, I confeſs, I find it ſomething difficult to determin, whether of theſe two ſenſes, with excluſion of the other be intended by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in my
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:64345:279"/>Text, whether, when he ſays, <hi>God will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that ye are able,</hi> his meaning ſhould be, God by his Wiſdom and Providence, will ſo contrive buſineſſes for you, that, though you are not likely to live in a contiual uninterrupted courſe of happineſs and ſecurity, but that ſometimes you ſhall daſh your foot againſt a ſtone, you ſhall be diſquieted and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted with afflictions of ſeveral natures; notwithſtanding, this you may be confident of, that let what misfortue will, come, how grievous and even inſupportable ſoever it may ſeem unto you, it ſhall never be ſo violent and out-ragious, but that God will provide a way for you to eſcape from it, there will be a dore left open for you to avoid the furiouſneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuouſneſs of it; either God will arm you with Patience to bear it, and then the comfort which your ſouls may feel, in the conſideration of what glorious rewards are promiſed unto your Patience, ſhall make your afflictions even matters of rejoycing unto you; in which reſpect, (as St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith) <hi>you ought to count it all joy, when you fall into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Temptations,</hi> Or, if thoſe Temptations and Afflictions reach ſo farr as to the deſtroying of your Lives, yet notwithſtanding all this, they are ſo unable to make you miſerable, unleſs you will take part with them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your own ſouls, by repining and murmuring under the mighty hand of God, that when you ſhall conſider that bleſſed change which death ſhall bring unto you, when all tears ſhall be wiped from your eyes, all fear and expectation of miſery removed, nothing but inexpreſsable and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting joys to be expected, you ſhall bleſs the time that ever you were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and with St. <hi>Paul</hi> confeſs, <hi>That the afflictions of this life are worthy of that joy which ſhall be revealed.</hi> This, I ſay, is a good Catholique, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox ſenſe, and which it is very probable, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> might more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly intend in theſe words of my Text.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Notwithſtanding I cannot exclude the other ſenſe of the word <hi>Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> from this Text; for according to the Analogy of Faith, and without any wrong done to the dependance and connexion of theſe words (<hi>God will not ſuffer you to be tempted,</hi> &amp;c.) St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s intent in them might be ſuch; as if it had been thus ſpread out more at large, though conſidering the many diſadvantages we have in the way of godlineſs, in reſpect both of our power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, malicions, induſtrious, and ſubtile Enemy the Devil, who continually waits upon us to entrap us; in reſpect of our ſeeming flattering friend, the world and vanities thereof alluring us; But eſpecially in reſpect of our own wicked and deceitful Hearts, forward and deſirous enough to embrace the wicked ſuggeſtions and temptations of both, nay, ſufficient to deſtroy us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance of either: I ſay, that though (theſe things conſidered) we may ſeem to be ſet (in the expreſſion of the Holy Ghoſt) <hi>upon ſlippery places,</hi> where it is almoſt impoſſible for us to keep our footing, and to preſerve our ſelves from falling dangerouſly, and daſhing our ſelves in pieces.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Notwithſtanding, if our eyes were opened, as were the eyes of the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s ſervant, we ſhould find as well as he, that they that be with us, are more than they that be againſt us: For God and his Holy Angels, who are on our ſide, are both wiſer and ſtronger than the Devil, and more willing to do us good, than the other can be to hurt us: Beſides, the expectation of thoſe gloriousrewards, which are laid up in Heaven for us, are ſufficient, even to any reaſonable man, to diſ-reliſh unto him the vain unſatisfying pleaſures of this world: And
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:64345:279"/>though our own hearts naturally be never ſo traiterous and unfaithful, yet by the power of that Grace which is plentifully ſhowred down upon every one of us in our Baptiſm, and which is dayly encreaſed and ſupplyed unto us, they may eaſily be corrected and renewed. So, that if the ſuggeſtion of any wicked Temptation get the maſtery over us, let us not impute too much to the valour and ſtrength of our Enemies; let us not accuſe God of any unwillingneſs to ſuccour us; For never any Temptation hath or ever ſhall happen unto us, but ſuch as is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, ſuitable unto the nature of man, ſuch as a reaſonable, conſiderate, and a circumſpect man, by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary aſſiſtance of God's Grace, and careful application of thoſe means wherewith we are abundantly furniſhed out of Holy Scripture, as Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Watchfulneſs, Faſting, and the like, may eaſily conquer and ſubdue.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. This ſenſe of theſe words may with as good reaſon and probability be ſuppos'd to be intended by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this place as the former: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, unleſs we inlarge St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words to this meaning alſo, we ſhall receive no extraordinary comfort and encouragement from them: For, though indeed, it is true, that it is more than we can deſerve at God's hands to obtain a Promiſe from him, to ſecure us, that no Temptations, no outward Afflictions of this world, ſhall be ſo violent and furious upon us, as to exceed the ſtrength of Reaſon and Grace to withſtand them; Yet, ſince Sin is that only Enemy which is able to withdraw God's favour from us, and make him our Enemy, unleſs we can be put in ſome hope, that there is a poſſible courſe for us to prevail againſt ſin alſo, and all the dangerous temptations and ſuggeſtions thereof, we ſhould live but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable diſcontented life, we ſhould be continually affrighted with ſad melancholick thoughts, with diſquieting jealouſies and fears, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may now and then pleaſe our ſelves with conceits of Gods favour for the preſent, yet, ſince he has paſs'd no promiſe of ſecuring us for the future, it may happen, that ſuch a ſinful Temptation may come upon us, which may be able, do what we can, to over-whelm us irrecoverably. Therefore ſince this latter ſenſe (which I mentioned of theſe words) is more profitable and advantageous to us, I will eſpecially at this time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt upon it, and labour to demonſtrate undeniably to every one of us, that <hi>God is faithful,</hi> and will aſſuredly make good that promiſe which he hath made unto us all, namely, <hi>not to ſuffer us to be tempted,</hi> that is, by any ſinful temptation, <hi>above that we are able.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. Now, he is ſaid to be tempted above that he is able, who, do what he can, though he ſtrain his natural endowments to the uttermoſt, and though he endeavour heartily, to make uſe of all the outward helps and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances which he finds preſcribed unto him out of Gods Word, though he extend that meaſure of Grace wherewith he is furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the extreameſt activity thereof to reſiſt ſuch a Temptation; yet, in the end is forced to yield to the power of it, utterly fainting and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the combat. So, on the contrary, that man who being compleatly furniſh'd with all requiſite weapons both for his own defence, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countring his Adverſary, and beſides, having in him both ability of body, and courage enough, and yet out of a ſleepy negligence, or obſtinate ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenneſs, will not take the pains to lift up his arm, or otherways beſtir him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to oppoſe his Enemy, ſuch a man, if overcome, can in no reaſon be
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64345:280"/>ſaid to be Over-match'd, but is a mere Traytour to his own ſafety and reputation.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And indeed, before I can proceed any further, I muſt either take this for granted, That ſome men though <hi>(de facto)</hi> they have been overcome by a Temptation, yet might have reſiſted it by the aſſiſtance of that Grace wherewith they were enabled, Or truly, I know not what to ſay: For, if this be a good inference, a man is overcome by a Temptation, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could not poſſibly have reſiſted, <hi>Adam,</hi> for all he was ſeduc'd by the Devil, is not ſo culpable as I took him to be. How can I charge ſuch a man for not doing his duty? How can I convince his Conſcience, that it was his own fault and negligence, that he did not that which he ought and might have done? Is there no man then to be found, that could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly have done no more good than actually he has done? Does every man improve that Talent of Grace which God has given him to the uttermoſt of his power and skill? Or will any of you, when you confeſs your ſins unto Almighty God, tell him to this purpoſe, Lord, I confeſs, I do daily fall into many and grievous ſins. But, ſince they are gone and paſt, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there was no remedy for it, it could not be avoided, thoſe ſins muſt needs have been practis'd by me, I did whatſoever I was enabled to do; If I had had more ſtrength, I had done better; when thou beſtoweſt on me more Talents of Grace, I ſhall be a more profitable ſervant, and yield thee a greater intereſt and advantage by them. If any of you entertain ſuch conceits as theſe, I confeſs, you are a great deal more righteous than I thought you had been.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. For mine own part, I confeſs with grief and ſhame, and ſelf-condemnation, that I have offended Almighty God in many reſpects, when I might have done otherwiſe. I have not only hid my Talent in a Napkin, I have not only not improv'd that ſtock of grace which God gave me; but, on the contrary, notwithſtanding that, I have been very laborious and abounding in the unfruitful works of darkneſs. I have wilfully grieved the Holy Spirit of God, and many times quenched his good motions in me. Yea, ſo voluntarily and reſolvedly have I done all theſe ſins, that I am perſwaded I could eaſily have choſen, whether I would have committed them or no; no neceſſity at all lay upon me to compel me thereunto, God was faithful and righteous in his promiſes and dealings with me, and my own wicked heart deceiv'd me. And, I think, all of you have been guilty in ſome meaſure of betraying and ſurrendring the abilities which God has beſtowed on you, though I dare not charge you ſo deeply as my ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Now that we have heard, who may be ſaid to be able to reſiſt a Temptation or not: For my more diſtinct proceeding in the confirmation of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Propoſition in my Text, I will take our Saviour's counſel, I will <hi>ſit down and examin, whether he that hath but ten thouſand, be able to meet with him which cometh againſt him with twenty thouſand.</hi> Here are two Enemies Camps, and no doubt great Forces on both ſides: But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion, diſproportionable: It concerns me therefore now, by taking a ſurvey and muſter of each, to demonſtrate, that in all reſpects the advantage lies on our ſide. I mentioned before, briefly, that we had three eſpecial Enemies to deal with, the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh: We will proceed in this order againſt them, in the firſt place examining the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64345:280"/>Devil's power, and the forces we have to oppoſe againſt him.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. There are many terrible names, I confeſs, by which the Devil is deſcribed in Holy Writ, He is called <hi>Abaddon,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>the Deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> as one whoſe imployment it were to counter-work againſt God; who calls himſelf <hi>the Saviour and preſerver of all men;</hi> He is call'd a <hi>ramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and a roaring Lyon, that runs about ſeeking whom he may devour;</hi> He is call'd <hi>the great Dragon, the old Serpent, the Devil, and Sathan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apocal. 12.9.</note> 
                     <hi>which deceiveth the whole world.</hi> (All this in one verſe.) He is call'd <hi>the Red fiery Dragon.</hi> There are extant a great many more hideous pictures of him in Gods Word: But theſe will ſerve our turn ſufficiently, to ſhew how dangerous an Enemy we have, and therefore how great ought to be our reſolution and wiſdom in encountring with him: And leſt we ſhould think, that ſince he is named in the fore-cited places in the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that therefore there is but one Lyon, and but one fiery Dragon to deal with all mankind, and thereupon begin to be a little more ſecure; ſince we ſhould have hard fortune, if it ſhould light upon us to be ſingled out by him, out of ſo infinite a crowd as the world is. No, God knows, it is ſo farr from that, that there is an unutterable number of them, ſuch an infinite vaſt Army, that one whole Legion (which are near about 4000) were at leiſure to poſſeſs one man; And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>We wreſtle not againſt fleſh and bloud,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay;<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.12.</note> Theſe worldly Enemies are ſo weak and deſpicable, in compariſon of thoſe we are to meet withal, that they are not to be reckoned of: But, ſays he, <hi>We wreſtle againſt Principalities and Powers,</hi> (There are, it ſeems, many Principalities and Powers) <hi>againſt the Rulers of the darkneſs of this world, againſt ſpiritual wickedneſſes in high places,</hi> (the word is) <hi>in heavenly places.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. Now, What have we to oppoſe againſt ſuch an innumerable mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Spirits, whereof each particular for his exceſſive ſtrength is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>a Lion;</hi> for his fierceneſs, a <hi>Dragon;</hi> for his poyſonous malice, <hi>a Red Dragon;</hi> for the extream intenſeneſs of that poyſonous malice, <hi>a Red fiery Dragon;</hi> and for his wiſdom and cunning to make uſe of this ſtrength, fierceneſs, and malice, he is called <hi>the old Serpent;</hi> one that has been a Serpent continually ſpitting out his poyſon againſt us, within very few dayes ſince any creature was; and therefore, if at the firſt, by his own natural wit, he was able, upon even terms, to overcome <hi>Adam,</hi> then inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and therefore not apt to betray himſelf, as we are, What may we conceive of him now after above 5000 years experience: I ſay, What ſhall we who are ready to fall into a ſound, if we ſee but an apparition of one of them, though he do us no harm, How are we likely, think you, to behave our ſelves in combat againſt ſo many thouſands of them?</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Why truly, God be thanked, notwithſtanding all this, we may do well enough. For we have ſpiritual Armies on our ſide too, that are able to contend with all theſe, and overcome them in all theſe advantages which they have againſt us. Are they many? <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels are more certainly; Which to me is evident by that ſaying in <hi>Daniel,</hi>

                  <p n="21">21. The ſecond enemy which we profeſſed hoſtility againſt in our Baptiſm, was the vain temptations of this world: And ſo forcible and prevailing are the temptations thereof; that the Devil (who for his powerful managing of this weapon is called <hi>the God of this world</hi>) in his Encounter with our Saviour, ſet up his reſt upon it, as ſuppoſing if this would not ſerve his turn, there were no more fighting for him; <hi>All this will I give thee,</hi> ſaid he. And ſuch a value he ſet upon this ſtake, that no leſs than the extremeſt degree of horrible Idolatry could ſerve his turn to oppoſe againſt it; <hi>All this will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me.</hi> And when he ſaw that this proffer would not be accepted, he preſently quits the field, deſpairing utterly of any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. The more dangerous indeed is this enemy, I may ſay, more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to us than the Devil himſelf; becauſe we all acknowledge the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in perſon to be our enemy; and therefore not one of us will be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to him for any thing, if he bring us the gift himſelf; a ſick man would not be healed by him, nor a poor man made rich, but ſcarce one among a thouſand has that opinion of the vain pomps and ſinful pleaſures of the world. Our enemy! No certainly, It is the beſt and moſt comforting friend we have in this life; all our thoughts are taken up with it, it poſſeſſeth us at all times, we dream of it ſleeping, and purſue it waking; And yet our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon.</hi> And again, <hi>How can ye believe, who ſeek honour one of another:</hi> And again, <hi>If any man love the world, the love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not in him.</hi> What ſtrength then have we to oppoſe this enemy?</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Why, ſurely that which would ſuffice but an ordinary, reaſonable man, and might ſerve any of us, but that we will needs be unreaſonable only in things which concern our everlaſting welfare: And that is the conſideration of thoſe unſpeakable joyes which ſhall attend thoſe who can deſpiſe the unſatisfying vain pleaſures of this life. A Philoſopher, which but reading <hi>Plato</hi>'s Poetical deſcription of the ſerenity of that life, which a vertuous ſoul (delivered from the Priſon of the body) lives, was ſo far tranſported with the conceit of it, though for ought he knew, there was no ſuch thing indeed; or if there were, perhaps never intended for him, that he becomes preſently weary of this priſon, and by a violent
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:64345:282"/>death frees himſelf from it; and God only knows what a change he found. Whereas we have Gods word for the certainty of that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life which his ſervants ſhall live; yea, a great deal of pains he hath taken, to make it deſirable and amiable unto us, by ranſacking all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of this world, the moſt coſtly jewels, the moſt precious metals, to embelliſh the deſcription thereof with all. We have beſides the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of ſeveral men, who have ſeen and taſted as much of that glory, as a mortal creature is capable of; S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and S. <hi>John</hi> the Divine. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the conſideration hereof might ſerve our turn, if not quite to diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh unto us, and even to make us hate the vain pleaſures of this world, yet, at leaſt, not to prefer them when they come in competition with the other: And I would to God we would ſuffer them but ſo far to prevail upon us. But I cannot ſtay.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. I have rank'd the three Armies of our enemies juſt after the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man faſhion, reſerving the Triaries, the old experienced Souldiers to the laſt. For though in ſhew, the firſt rank of the Devils appear moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; yet in very deed, all their power is nothing, unleſs the luſts of our hearts take part with them, and give them advantage againſt us. The luſts of the fleſh, are thoſe Traytors which continually keep us compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, we cannot be quit of them; without the Devils aſſiſtance, they are able to captive us; what, think you, then are they able to do, being man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ag'd by ſo powerful, ſo wiſe an enemy? without them, all the power of Hell and darkneſs are inſufficient to withdraw us from our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and, by conſequence, from the love and favour of God. For, ſuppoſe the Devil (for example) preſent a luſtful object to our fancy, as it were holding a laſcivious picture before our eyes; if we conſent not in our minds, to any baſe delight in ſuch a ſpectacle; if we ſettle not our thoughts upon it, as upon a pleaſing ſight; it will be ſo far from doing us any harm, that it will rather prove a means to root us more deeply in the favour of God, as perſons unwilling to take Pay of his and our enemies.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. But alas, as we are ordinarily ſo far from this nobleneſs of mind, from this bravery of a Chriſtian-like Spirit; that, as if the Devil were too ſlow to object ſuch Temptations to us, we will not await his lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; but on all occaſions be ready and deſirous to raiſe up, and then ſettle ſuch unworthy thoughts in our minds; we will be content to ſpend many hours ſometimes in the acting of this inward contemplative Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe luſts of our fleſh, calls them our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, when he ſaith,<note place="margin">Col. 3.5.</note>

What ſtrength have we now to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to theſe moſt pernicious enemies, which are ſo cloſely cemented, and even incorporated within us, that they are become as it were fleſh of our fleſh, and bones of our bones?</p>

                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:64345:282"/>
25. Why ſurely, as naturally we have received this root of Bitterneſs in our hearts, which is apt to give an infections tincture to all the thoughts and actions iſſuing from thence. So likewiſe it hath pleaſed Almighty God to imprint a new Principle in our minds, to plant as it were a new Spirit in our ſouls; I mean, that active powerful Grace, which without any co-operation of our own, he infuſes into us eſpecially, in our Baptiſm; and which is afterward, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſtrengthened and enlivened daily, by a conſtant frequent exerciſing our ſelves in the uſe of thoſe manifold bleſſed means of our ſalvation, the hearing, reading, and meditating on his holy Word, and participation of his heavenly my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. For ſurely, if Reaſon alone (by the help of thoſe worthy grave precepts which are extant in the Treatiſes of Moral Philoſophy) hath been able to change many men from the habitual practiſe of ſeveral vices to a vertuous (I had like to have ſaid alſo a Religious) life; why ſhould any man think ſo meanly of God's holy Word and Sacraments, as to doubt, but that much rather they ſhould be able to make us <hi>new creatures, to make us wiſe unto ſalvation,</hi> eſpecially conſidering that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual aſſiſtance of Gods Holy Spirit which infallibly attends the uſe and exerciſe of thoſe his bleſſed means. Do you think God is ſo favourable to the Devil or his inſtruments, (our luſts) that he is unwilling to have them ſubdued and mortified in us? And, if he be not unwilling, ſurely much leſs is he unable to perform this great work in us, even to the end.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Therefore, as before, ſpeaking of thoſe outward forces, God and his holy Angels, which are ready to take our parts, and fight on our ſides againſt the Devil, and his Angels, we apply'd that ſaying of <hi>Eliſha</hi> to his ſervant, If thine eyes were opened, thou ſhouldeſt perceive, <hi>that they which are with us, are more then they which are againſt us.</hi> So likewiſe in the Caſe in hand, we may make uſe of that ſaying of S. <hi>John, Greater is he which is in you, than he which is in the world:</hi> implying,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.4.</note> that God is not only in himſelf ſtronger than the Devil, but alſo as conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>in us, i. e.</hi> as working in our hearts by his Grace; This way, I ſay, he is ſtronger than the Devil; His Spirit co-operating with the means of our ſalvation, is more vigorous and powerfuul to reuew us unto the Image of his Holineſs; if we will but do that which lies in our own power, then the Devil (though taking his advantage of that concupiſcence, which in ſome meaſure is continually reſident in us) is or can be to corrupt, and ſo to deſtroy us. For his power is not conſiderable, unleſs we be willing to joyn with him. Thus you ſee, though our enemies be allowed all the advantages, they can challenge, yet in exact eſteem, without any flattering of our ſelves, we may conclude, that they who are ready, and deſirons to joyn forces with us, are greater, in all reſpects, than they which are againſt us.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. But yet for all this, ſince the conducting and managing of thoſe forces, is left to our diſcretion; for God will not fight ſingle againſt the Devil in our behalf, unleſs we lend him our aid and aſſiſtance: And therefore, <hi>Curſe ye Meroz, ſaith the Angel of the Lord</hi> (in the Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Song of <hi>Deborah</hi>) <hi>curſe bitterly the inhabitants thereof.</hi> And why muſt poor <hi>Meroz</hi> be ſo bitterly curſed? <hi>Becauſe they came not to the help
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:64345:283"/>of the Lord, to the help of the Lord againſt the Mighty.</hi> Hereupon it may ſeem, that Almighty God will not put to his ſtrength in our defence, unleſs we joyn with him; He will not be our Champion to fight, whileſt we ſit ſtill, only ſpectators of the combat. And therefore this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration alone may be ſufficient to abate that confidence, which the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going diſcourſe, might be apt to raiſe in us, eſpecially if we be not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtrangers to our ſelves, if we be not ignorant of our own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. For ſatisfaction therefore to this diſcouragement, I will now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to demonſtrate by proofs drawn from undeniable Reaſon, and experience, That there is no ſinful Temptation ſo ſtrong, but that an ordinary Chriſtian may (by the aſſiſtance before mentioned) eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer it. And leſt my proceeding herein may lye open to any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of exception; let me chooſe from among you the weakeſt, moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienc'd Chriſtian, I dare oppoſe this man againſt the ſharpeſt and moſt furious Temptation; and will make him confeſs, that though he be <hi>(de facto)</hi> ſubdued by it, yet that that came to paſs meerly by his own voluntary and affected unwatchfulneſs and cowardiſe, and that it was truly in very deed, in his power to have reſiſted it. I will make choice to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the ſin of uncleanneſs and fornication; a ſin, that generally finds ſuch excuſe and patronage in the world; becauſe it is ſuppoſed to be ſo naturally born and bred up with us, that there is no ſhaking it off; it is a ſin ſo reſolved upon to be unconquerable, that few men go about to reſtrain it. The ancient Antidotes againſt this ſin, Watching and Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are grown out of uſe with us, we conclude they will do us little good againſt this hereditary evil, and therefore the beſt is to give them clean over.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Yet I ſay, let me ſuppoſe an ordinary Chriſtian, environed with all the ſtrongeſt temptations to this ſo natural, and therefore concluded ſo excuſable a ſin; let him have the moſt charming beauty, that has the moſt artificial waies of ſollicitation, together with opportunity, and all circumſtances which are not fit to be ſuppoſed here; yet for all this, if that man ſhould ſay he is not able to reſiſt ſuch a tempration, he lies againſt his own ſoul: For if at that inſtant, a ſudden meſſage ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt him, a threatning of Death, if he did not free himſelf from the danger of her filthy embraces, would he not do it? I deſire only that each one of you in his heart would anſwer for him. Then it is clear, he is able to reſiſt this pretended irreſiſtable temptation: And why ſhould not the conſideration of the danger of eternal Torments be as perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive againſt any ſin, as the fear of a momentany death? But I will not make my advantage of ſo frightful an enemy to his pleaſure, as Death. Suppoſe in all thoſe circumſtances before mentioned, a good ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney were but offered him, upon condition he would abſtain but that time from the execution of his filthy luſt: I doubt not at all, but that upon theſe terms he would find ſtrength enough to conquer this Temptation. Shall Satan then be able to caſt out Satan, and ſhall not God much more do it? Shall one ſin be able to deſtroy the exerciſe of another, and ſhall not Grace much rather?</p>

30.

                  <p n="31">31. Laſtly, you may remember that our Saviour (in his deſcriptions of Hell) ſeldome leaves out this phraſe, <hi>where the worm dieth not:</hi> which worm is generall by interpreters moraliz'd into the ſting of conſcience, <hi>i.e.</hi> a continual vexation of ſoul in the Reprobates, cauſed by the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, how it was meerly their own fault, their wilful folly, which brought them to that miſery.

                     </label> But this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will ſatisfie as little as the former: For ſuppoſe (for example) a man at this inſtant in the ſtate of Grace, and ſo in the favour of God. Upon theſe grounds, it is impoſſible that this man ſhould ever ſin; For ſurely God will not undeſervedly take away his Grace from him, till he merit that puiſhment by his Sin; and till God take away his Grace from him, he cannot ſin; therefore he muſt never ſin. But this diſcourſe, though it meerly concern Practiſe, looks ſo like a Controverſie, that I am wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. We are apt enough to ſlander God with too much mercy ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, as if he bore us ſo particular an affection, that notwithſtanding our never ſo many ſins, yet he will ſtill be merciful unto us. Oh that we
